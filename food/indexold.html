This chapter describes how National Food Balance Sheets (FBSs) and 
House&shy;hold Surveys allow a quantitative 
assess&shy;ment of food avail&shy;able for 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion at national 
and house&shy;hold levels, respectively. Data expressed as 
per capita food supply for human con&shy;sump&shy;tion can be used to estimate 
per capita avail&shy;able intake of foods as well as energy and nutri&shy;ents through matching with food com&shy;posi&shy;tion data.
<p></p>
Food Balance Sheets are calcu&shy;lated 
from national food produc&shy;tion, plus imports 
and food taken from stocks, with exports and food added to stocks  subtracted to 
obtain an estimate of gross country's food supply. Both food diverted for 
non-human uses (e.g. animal feed, seed, non-food use) and the loss up to retail 
level are then subtracted from the gross country's food supply to obtain the net 
country's food supply (i.e. total food avail&shy;able for human 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion in a country at the retail level). 
FBSs are particularly important for 
low-income coun&shy;tries, where food 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion surveys at the house&shy;hold or 
indi&shy;vidual-level are not performed regularly on a rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;tative sample 
of the popu&shy;lation. Unlike, house&shy;hold surveys, 
data from FBS provide no infor&shy;mation 
on the distrib&shy;ution of the food supply
within the country (in terms of geographical areas or 
socio-economic groups) or according to seasons. 
<p></p>
House&shy;hold food con&shy;sump&shy;tion is 
defined as the total amount of food and beverages 
avail&shy;able for con&shy;sump&shy;tion both within a household 
and/or prepared and consumed outside a house&shy;hold, 
family group, or institution. 
Food con&shy;sump&shy;tion by the house&shy;hold can be actually 
mea&shy;sured (i.e., in House&shy;hold 
Food Con&shy;sump&shy;tion Surveys &mdash; HFCS), or assessed from 
food avail&shy;able for con&shy;sump&shy;tion 
(i.e., in House&shy;hold Food and Expenditure Surveys &mdash; 
HCES). Harmonized methods are being devel&shy;oped that
include a standardized food component module designed to estimate nutrient supply 
at the household level and apparent nutrient intake at the indi&shy;vidual level, for 
widespread use in low&#8209; and middle-income economies.
<p></p>
Several indi&shy;cators are avail&shy;able 
based on FBS and HCES data to monitor and 
compare poverty and food security and nutrition 
at the global and national levels based on the 
quantity of food avail&shy;able for 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion, e.g., preva&shy;lence of under&shy;nourish&shy;ment 
(PoU).	However, data 
from FBS or house&shy;hold surveys (HCS or HCES) 
provide no infor&shy;mation on the avail&shy;ability of 
food/nutri&shy;ents across the life span and the interpre&shy;tation of the data 
in terms of dietary adequacy presents challenges and uncertainties unless 
complemented with indi&shy;vidual-level dietary intake data. 
Increasingly, global data bases based on information synthesized from FBS, HCFS, 
and indi&shy;vidual-level food consumption surveys are being used. Examples include 
the Global Dietary Database and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 
(IHME) initiative. These are capable of modeling worldwide indi&shy;vidual intakes of 
foods and nutrients across the life span with the goal of improving health of the 
most vulnerable populations through improved diets.

<h3>2.0 Introduction</h3>

This chapter considers survey methods suitable for a quantitative 
assess&shy;ment of food avail&shy;able 
for con&shy;sump&shy;tion / consumed at national and 
house&shy;hold levels. Methods suitable for measuring 
food con&shy;sump&shy;tion at the 
indi&shy;vidual level are discussed in Chapter&nbsp;3. 
Methods designed to estimate the 
exposure to hazardous sub&shy;stances, although some&shy;times 
based on house&shy;hold food 
supply, and those providing only a  
qualitative assess&shy;ment or capturing 
only part of the avail&shy;able food supply (e.g.,
using Universal Product Codes &mdash; UPCs), are not considered.
<p></p>
The food avail&shy;able for human con&shy;sump&shy;tion by a popu&shy;lation
can be assessed through nationally rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;tative surveys at the national level 
using Food balance Sheets (FBS), 
or alternatively at the house&shy;hold level using either 
House&shy;hold Con&shy;sump&shy;tion Surveys (HFCS) or 
House&shy;hold Con&shy;sump&shy;tion and Expenditure 
Surveys (HCES). The resulting data from all these surveys are expressed as 
per capita food supply for human con&shy;sump&shy;tion, 
and are used to estimate per capita 
avail&shy;able intake of foods, and energy and nutri&shy;ents, 
when matched with appropriate 
food com&shy;posi&shy;tion data.
<p></p>
The term that should be used for data derived from most of these national and 
house&shy;hold surveys is either &ldquo;food supply&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;food avail&shy;able for con&shy;sump&shy;tion&rdquo; rather 
than &ldquo;food con&shy;sump&shy;tion&rdquo;. Only certain 
types of house&shy;hold surveys measure <i>actual</i> foods consumed.
<p></p>
Data from FBSs provide no infor&shy;mation 
on the distrib&shy;ution of the food avail&shy;able 
for con&shy;sump&shy;tion within the 
country (in terms of geographical areas, seasonally, 
or demographic characteristics), unlike 
the data gener&shy;ated from house&shy;hold 
surveys. However, house&shy;hold 
surveys (HCS or HCES) do not provide infor&shy;mation 
on the avail&shy;ability of food/nutri&shy;ents across the life span. Moreover, the 
interpre&shy;tation of the data from house&shy;hold 
surveys in terms of dietary adequacy 
presents challenges and uncertainties unless 
complemented with indi&shy;vidual-level 
dietary intake data. 
<p></p>
Several indi&shy;cators can be derived from 
FBS and HCES data to monitor and compare 
poverty and food security at the national level. These indi&shy;cators can 
be based on the quantity of food avail&shy;able 
for con&shy;sump&shy;tion (e.g., preva&shy;lence of 
under&shy;nourish&shy;ment (PoU) based on the 
energy supply per capita), as well as the food 
quality (e.g., HCES Dietary Diversity Score).	

<h3>2.1 Food balance sheets </h3>

Food balance sheets are particularly important in coun&shy;tries where 
food con&shy;sump&shy;tion surveys 
at the house&shy;hold or indi&shy;vidual level are not 
performed regularly on a rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;tative sample of the popu&shy;lation, 
as occurs for some low-income coun&shy;tries. 
<p></p>
Several terms have been used to describe FBSs. 
These include &ldquo;country's food supply&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;national food accounts&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;food moving into con&shy;sump&shy;tion&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;food con&shy;sump&shy;tion statistics&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;food disappearance data&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;food avail&shy;able for con&shy;sump&shy;tion&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;con&shy;sump&shy;tion level estimates&rdquo;. Here, the term 
&ldquo;country's food supply&rdquo; is used. 
<p></p>
Food balance sheets present a comprehensive picture 
of the pattern of a country's food supply 
during a specified reference period: the calendar year, 
the agricultural year or the 
crop year (FAO, 2021c). The sources of the food supply 
and its utilization are reported for 
each food item potentially 
avail&shy;able for human con&shy;sump&shy;tion, and includes primary 
com&shy;modities such as ‘wheat, rice, fruit, 
veg&shy;etables,  and processed com&shy;modities 
such as veg&shy;etable oils and butter. FBS data 
cannot be disag&shy;gregated to deter&shy;mine 
the distrib&shy;ution of a country's food supply spatially, seasonally, or by 
demographic characteristics.
<p></p>
Both official and unofficial data are used for the compilation of FBSs; National 
statistical offices con&shy;stitute an important data source. 
However, data mea&shy;sured directly on food avail&shy;ability at national level 
may be difficult to obtain (FAO, 2021a). Instead,  
FBS compilers often derive estimates of food avail&shy;ability by making certain 
adjustments based on other existing data sets 
that measure food produc&shy;tion or 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion. For example, two official data sources that may assist in 
the estimation of a country's 
food supply avail&shy;ability are Industrial Output Surveys 
and House&shy;hold Con&shy;sump&shy;tion and Expenditure Surveys (HCES). 
See Section 2.2 for the description of HCES surveys.
<p></p>
The country's food supply is calcu&shy;lated 
from national food produc&shy;tion, plus 
imports, plus food taken from stocks. Exports and food added to stocks are then 
subtracted to obtain a gross estimate of 
a country's food supply. The estimates of 
food diverted for non-human uses (e.g. animal feed, seed, non-food use) and of 
food loss are then subtracted from the gross country's food supply to 
obtain the net country's food supply,
i.e. the total food avail&shy;able for human 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion in a country at the retail level 
(Figure&nbsp;2.1, FAO 2021d). Data on non-commercial 
food produc&shy;tion and detailed infor&shy;mation 
on processed foods are not avail&shy;able in Food Balance Sheets.

<a id="figure2.1"></a>

</figure>
<p></p>
For the purposes of the FBS, &ldquo;food loss&rdquo; 
closely aligns with &ldquo;post-harvest / post-slaughter loss&rdquo;. 
It represents the quantity of food that leaves the 
produc&shy;tion / supply chain at any stage, e.g., 
during produc&shy;tion, pro&shy;cess&shy;ing and 
distrib&shy;ution, up to the retail 
level (FAO 2021a). Food loss may be considerable 
in coun&shy;tries where the agricultural 
products reach the consumer after travelling 
long distances and/or passing through several 
intermediaries prior to retail. In 
such cases, large amounts of food are lost because of damage, especially  
perishable foods such as fresh fruit and veg&shy;etables or 
processed foods with a short 
shelf life. Assumptions about losses may be based 
on expert opinion obtained in the 
coun&shy;tries. Losses or waste at the retailer, 
food catering, and house&shy;hold level are 
not considered in the compilation of FBS. Hence, total food supply estimates 
derived from the FBS are likely to be higher than average food 
consumed at the house&shy;hold level. 
<p></p>
An example of the upper portion of an FAO food 
balance sheet which also shows in detail the sources of domestic supply and 
utilization of two of the major food groups (i.e., Cereals and Starchy roots) is 
shown in Table&nbsp;2.1.

<p></p>
In some cases, infor&shy;mation on a country's food stocks 
is not avail&shy;able. The effect of this 
data gap is reduced by preparing FBSs as a moving average for 3y periods  
for all coun&shy;tries. For more details, 
see FAO (2021f)
<p></p>
FAO in its online database (FAOSTAT) pro&shy;vides free access to FBSs for 
over 245 coun&shy;tries and territories and all the FAO regional groups, from 
1961 to date (FAO, 2021c).  
The FBSs reported are &ldquo;standardized FBSs&rdquo; in 
which the com&shy;modity list is confined 
only to the quantity of the 
primary com&shy;modities avail&shy;able for con&shy;sump&shy;tion, with 
the quantity of processed com&shy;modities converted into their original primary 
com&shy;modity equivalent. For example, for bread, quantities are expressed in wheat 
equivalents comprising wheat flour and wheat-flour products.  For more details on 
the standardization of Food Balance Sheets, 
see FAO (2021g).
<p></p>
The major food groups listed in the FAO FBS data are shown in Box&nbsp;2.1. 
A list of food com&shy;modities classified into these major food groups is 
avail&shy;able from FAO (2021c) in the definition and 
standard section of the FBS website.  
As an example, the food com&shy;modity &ldquo;cassava&rdquo; 
can be found in the food group &ldquo;starchy roots&rdquo;.

The per capita supply avail&shy;able for 
human con&shy;sump&shy;tion is obtained by dividing 
the food supply by the estimate of the 
partaking popu&shy;lation in each country; it is 
expressed in grams per capita of indi&shy;vidual food com&shy;modities. FAO uses mid-
year official popu&shy;lation estimates 
released by the United Nations Devel&shy;opment Program   
<a href ="https://popu&shy;lation.un.org/wpp/"> (UNDP)</a>.  According to the latest 
FAO recom&shy;men&shy;dation for FBS compilers, 
the number of migrants and tourists 
must be calcu&shy;lated as the differ&shy;ence between country's outbound 
travellers and inbound visitors and then 
subtracted from the population estimate (FAO, 2021a).  
<p></p>
Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity, and in terms 
of caloric value, referred to as the Dietary Energy Supply (DES) 
(kcal/capita/day). The pro&shy;tein and fat content of each 
food group and com&shy;modity calcu&shy;lated by 
applying appropriate food com&shy;posi&shy;tion 
factors are also avail&shy;able and expressed in 
terms of g/capita/day) (see Table&nbsp;2.1). In the future, FAO may also provide 
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent data for each food group and com&shy;modity. 
<p></p>
Food balance sheets are derived statistics. Hence, their accuracy is 
dependent on the reliability of the underlying basic statistics. The coverage and 
accuracy of underlying statistics vary markedly across coun&shy;tries. In some 
low-income coun&shy;tries, the coverage and quality of the 
statistics are uncertain &mdash; especially for 
food diverted for non-human food uses and for food stocks.
As well, in low-income coun&shy;tries where subsistence 
agriculture is widespread, FBSs may result in an 
under&shy;estimate of per capita food 
supply because the house&shy;hold con&shy;sump&shy;tion of vegetal food 
products obtained through growing or 
gathering, and animal food products through breeding or hunting, are 
not considered in the FBS calculations.  Further, as food systems become more 
sophisticated in coun&shy;tries, systematic errors may increase.
<p></p>
As a result, FAO documents caution that avail&shy;ability for 
human con&shy;sump&shy;tion does not 
equate with con&shy;sump&shy;tion. The quantities of 
food avail&shy;able for human con&shy;sump&shy;tion, 
as esti&shy;mated in the FBS, 
reflect only the quantities reaching the consumer at retail level. 
The amount of food (and of nutri&shy;ents) 
actually consumed may be lower than the quantity shown 
depending on the degree of loss and waste of edible food 
and nutri&shy;ents in the house&shy;hold. 
These may occur during storage, in preparation 
and cooking, as plate-waste, and when fed to domestic animals and pets, or when 
thrown away. Of these sources, storage, preparation, and cooking will have a 
greater effect on the content of vitamins and minerals of the food com&shy;modities 
than on the pro&shy;tein and fat content. 
See: FAO (2021h).
<p></p>
Recently, FAO has changed its FBS method&shy;ology, details of which are described in 
the document &ldquo;The New Food Balances and the utilization variables&rdquo; 
(FAO, 2021a). The key differ&shy;ences between the new and old FBS include 
a proportional balancing mechanism, use of the 2019 UNPD popu&shy;lation data, 
inclusion of a new food module, revised computations for losses, feed, and 
stocks, and addition of a new element on non-food for industrial use; for more 
details see FAO (2021b). 
<p></p>
The release of FBS data for 2019 includes this new 
method&shy;ology for the FBS data for 2014-2019. The new method&shy;ology has also been 
applied backwards to cover 2010-2013, thereby giving consistency over time for 
the national per capita food supply data from 2010 to 2019. In the new 
method&shy;ology, food avail&shy;able 
for con&shy;sump&shy;tion by non-resident visitors has also 
been included for selected coun&shy;tries in which 
tourism has a significant impact on 
the food supply (e.g., Small island Developing States). 
Food Balance Sheet data pre&shy;ceding 
2010 will soon be recompiled 
using the new method&shy;ology.  FAO has devel&shy;oped a FBS 
capacity devel&shy;opment package for 
coun&shy;tries that includes a compilation tool
incorporating the new method&shy;ology. Details are given in (FAO 2022a).  
<p></p>

<h3>2.1.1 Uses of Food Balance Sheet data</h3>

Food Balance Sheet data are easily 
accessible and provide coverage of per capita 
food supply across coun&shy;tries and regions using a relatively consistent 
method&shy;ology compared to many other sources of data on food supply.



<a id="figure2.2"></a>
<figure style="width: 40%">
<img src="figures/fig2.2.jpg" class="hundred" alt="Figure&nbsp;2.2">
<figcaption class="cap">

2010 to 2019 (kcal/cap/day).  From FAO (2021d).
</figcaption>
</figure>

Hence, they 
are often used to analyze overall trends, historic trends, and changes at 
country, regional, and global levels, in relation to both 
Dietary Energy Supply (Figure&nbsp;2.2) and Food Groups (Figure&nbsp;2.3). 
Asia has experienced the fastest growth in DES since 2010 (i.e., 6%), whereas in 
contrast the lowest historical DES is apparent in Africa, where there has been a 
slightly decreasing trend over the last decade (Figure&nbsp;2.2).
<p></p>
Food Balance Sheets can also be used to formulate agricultural 
policies concerned with the produc&shy;tion, 
distrib&shy;ution, and con&shy;sump&shy;tion of foods. 

<p class="clearleft">

<figcaption class="cap">
Figure&nbsp;2.3. Global food avail&shy;ability com&shy;posi&shy;tion in 2019 
From FAO (2021d). 
</figcaption>
</figure>
In relation to food groups, at the global 
level in&nbsp;2019,  cereals accounted for 
the highest share of the total food supply, 
both in quantities (in tonnes) avail&shy;able (25%) 
and dietary energy (44%), whereas although fruit and veg&shy;etables 
represented 31% of the total
quantities avail&shy;able, they  only accounted for 7% of the total 
dietary energy available due to their low kilocalorie content. 
In contrast, sugar, and fats and oils represented only 
4% and 3% of the total quantities 
avail&shy;able but 8% and 14%
respectively of the dietary energy available, as shown in Figure&nbsp;2.3.
<p></p>
In addition, FBS data have many other uses, including corre&shy;lations with other 
data which have a global coverage.  Thar et&nbsp;al. (2020) 
have summarized several  health-related uses of FBS data, 
as shown in Box 2.2 based on their review of 119 FBS surveys. They 
identified 50 studies con&shy;ducted from the 
earliest avail&shy;able until 2016 
that examined associations between dietary factors 
and mortality or health outcomes such as cancer, diabetes, or 
obesity. However, any interpre&shy;tation 
in terms of causal/effect of such observed 
associations is highly ques&shy;tion&shy;able and 
should be discouraged. Further, given the 
impor&shy;tance of the decisions that may be 
taken based on FBS data, users need to 
have a good under&shy;standing of the strengths 
and weak&shy;nesses of the source of 
the data. See Table&nbsp;2.2 and the report by 
Jacobs & Sumner (2002) for a thorough 
analysis of the appropriate uses and potential weaknesses of FBS data.

Several investigators have examined 
the validity of the global dietary estimates 
gener&shy;ated from FAO FBS data. 
For example, Gobbo et&nbsp;al. (2015) compared the FAO 
data with estim&shy;ates based on nationally rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;tative dietary data from 
indi&shy;vidual-level surveys from 113 coun&shy;tries. Substantial overestimates were 
reported for most food groups including fruit, veg&shy;etables, whole grains, red and 
processed meat, fish and seafood, milk, and total energy, whereas beans and 
legumes, nuts and seeds were under-esti&shy;mated 
based on FAO national food-supply 
data compared to the corres&shy;sponding estimates from the national data at the 
indi&shy;vidual-level. As a result, calibration 
equations were devel&shy;oped to adjust the 
FAO estimates to improve their validity. The authors suggest that these 
calibration models could be used not only to improve estimates based on FBS data 
of per capita food intakes at the national level but also by age and sex. 
<p></p>
One of the main uses of FBS is to monitor global hunger and
food security to provide 
data on national diets and 
their nutri&shy;ent adequacy. With these, insights into the 
coun&shy;tries and regions that are most 
likely to be at greatest risk for low dietary 
supply of energy (DES)(kcal per capita) 
of as well as selected nutri&shy;ents, can be 
provided. 
Selected indicators derived from the food  
component data of FBS and used to monitor global hunger, 
food security, and nutrient adequacy are presented in Box 2.3 . 
Details of some of their applications are given below.

<h3>2.1.1a Trends in global hunger</h3>

Ideally, the assess&shy;ment of global hunger (and food security) 
should be based on national data on 
food con&shy;sump&shy;tion at the 
house&shy;hold (see Section&nbsp;2.2) or the indi&shy;vidual level (see 
Chapter&nbsp;3). However, only a few 
coun&shy;tries conduct such surveys on an annual 
basis. Therefore, FBSs have a key role in the assess&shy;ment of 
global hunger and food 
insecurity, published yearly in 
the report &ldquo;The State of Food 
Security and Nutri&shy;tion in the World&rdquo; 
by FAO, IFAD, 
UNICEF, WFP and WHO (2022). This global 
monitoring report identifies coun&shy;tries in 
which food insecurity is most prevalent, 
monitors global hunger and food security trends over time, 
and pro&shy;vides projections of future global hunger and food insecurity. 
<p></p>
In this report, the per capita Dietary Energy 
Supply (DES) (Box&nbsp;2.3 and Table&nbsp;2.1)
esti&shy;mated from FBSs is used as a proxy for the average energy intake of the 
popu&shy;lation. The per capita Dietary Energy Supply (DES) is avail&shy;able from 
FAOSTAT and calcu&shy;lated using an FAO global food 
com&shy;posi&shy;tion database. 
The sum of the dietary energy content of the total food 
supply is then divided by the popu&shy;lation size of the country and by 365 to 
calculate the per capita daily dietary energy 
supply (DES) avail&shy;able for human 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion (See Table&nbsp;2.1 and Figure&nbsp;2.2). 
However, DES does not yield any 
infor&shy;mation on the afford&shy;ability, 
access, or con&shy;sump&shy;tion of dietary energy by 
different popu&shy;lation groups within a country.
In addition to DES, the contribution of energy 
from indi&shy;vidual food groups (Table&nbsp;2.1).
avail&shy;able for human con&shy;sump&shy;tion 
at the global level and within a country are also 
calcu&shy;lated. 
<p></p>
Dietary Energy Supply is one of the three metrics used to estimate the
preva&shy;lence of under&shy;nourish&shy;ment (PoU), 
an indi&shy;cator based on the per&shy;cent&shy;age of 
indi&shy;viduals in the popu&shy;lation who are in a condition of &ldquo;under&shy;
nourish&shy;ment&rdquo; (Table&nbsp;2.2). PoU is 
one of the indi&shy;cators of Sustainable 
Devel&shy;opment Goal&nbsp;2 (FAO 2021e) and is 
defined by FAO as the condition of an 
indi&shy;vidual whose habitual food con&shy;sump&shy;tion 
is insufficient to provide, on average, the amount of dietary energy required to 
maintain a normal, active, and healthy life. The national PoU estimates are 
reported as three-year moving averages, whereas the regional and global 
aggregates are reported as annual estimates. PoU, however, does not provide 
infor&shy;mation on which specific indi&shy;viduals 
are under&shy;nourished or on the quality or 
diversity of the diet. The three metrics used to estimate PoU are:

<ul>
<li>Average dietary energy con&shy;sump&shy;tion (DEC).  
DEC is based on DES minus the incidence of caloric losses at 
retail distribution level  
<li>Coefficient of Variation (CV) of energy intake. 
This is a measure of the levelS of 
inequalities in access to food con&shy;sump&shy;tion and 
hence dietary energy con&shy;sump&shy;tion within a popu&shy;lation 
<li>Average minimum dietary energy require&shy;ment (MDER) per person 
for the national popu&shy;lation in each of the 
covered coun&shy;tries. This represents the 
minimum amount of dietary energy per person that is considered adequate to ensure 
they maintain a minimum weight for health.
</li></ul>

To the CV of energy intake, 
data on inter-house&shy;hold variability 
from house&shy;hold surveys such as House&shy;hold 
Con&shy;sump&shy;tion and Expenditure 
Surveys (HCES) are used. Higher CV values represent 
larger levels of dietary inequality. Use of such data in the PoU calculation is 
crucial because food (and conse&shy;quently energy) is never equally distributed among 
house&shy;holds within a country. 
Hence, any comparison of per capita DES with energy 
require&shy;ments at the country level 
without considering the CV of energy intake 
would largely under&shy;estimate the 
preva&shy;lence of food insecurity at house&shy;hold level 
in many coun&shy;tries. 
<p></p>
To derive the MDER, factors such as the age structure, sex, height, and activity 
levels of indi&shy;viduals within each country 
are applied to assess the distrib&shy;ution 
of energy require&shy;ments. Using the variation in intake and energy 
require&shy;ments, under&shy;nourish&shy;ment can be calcu&shy;lated. 
More details of how these three metrics 
are used to estimate PoU are given in FAO (2022).

Note the presence of persistent regional disparities in the proportion of the 
popu&shy;lation affected by hunger from 
2005 to 2021 (Table&nbsp;2.2), with Africa having  the highest 
burden of under&shy;nourish&shy;ment as well as the 
region with the largest increase in the 
proportion of the popu&shy;lation 
affected by hunger during this time. Disparities 
also exist at the subregional levels: these are also summarized in the report. 
<p></p>
FAO also pro&shy;vides data on the Cost and 
Afford&shy;ability of a Healthy Diet (CAHD). 
This has been shown to be strongly associated with PoU and with different forms 
of malnutri&shy;tion, including child stunting and adult obesity. The cost of a 
healthy diet is defined by FAO as the minimum cost of food, using the least 
expensive avail&shy;able items in each country, 
that people have to pay to secure a 
healthy diet. The latter is based on the cost of the average quantities of each 
food group recom&shy;mended in  national Food Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDG). On 
average, the healthy diet 
meets 95% of nutri&shy;ent needs. 
<p></p>
To deter&shy;mine afford&shy;ability 
of a healthy diet, the cost of a healthy diet is compared with country-specific 
income distrib&shy;utions avail&shy;able 
in the &ldquo;Poverty and Inequality Platform&rdquo; (PIP) of the 
World Bank. From these data, the 
per&shy;cent&shy;age and number of people in each country / region
who cannot afford a healthy diet are esti&shy;mated. 
The threshold for an unaf&shy;ford&shy;able 
healthy diet in 2020 was when its cost exceeded 63% of the 
income in a country. However, food prices have 
surged since 2020, so this threshold 
for unaf&shy;ford&shy;ability is likely to change. 
For more details on the derivation of 
CAHD and the estimates of the number of people in the world and by region and 
subregion, see Chapters&nbsp;2&nbsp;and&nbsp;3 and ANNEX&nbsp;3 in FAO, IFAD, 
UNICEF, WFP and WHO (2022).

<h3>2.1.1b  Food security indi&shy;cators at national level</h3>

FAO (1996) has defined &ldquo;Food Security&rdquo; 
as <blockquote>&ldquo;a state in which all 
people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and 
nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active 
and healthy life&rdquo;</blockquote>   
<p></p>
Five indi&shy;cators present in the FAO &ldquo;Suite of indi&shy;cators of 
food security&rdquo; are derived from 3y moving averages of 
FBS data and are shown in Box&nbsp;2.3.
Note that none of these indi&shy;cators 
provide infor&shy;mation on the afford&shy;ability, 
acces&shy;sibility, or con&shy;sump&shy;tion 
by different popu&shy;lation groups including
nutri&shy;tionally vulnerable groups. 
For more details, see: FAO (2022).

The average dietary energy supply (DES) adequacy is defined as the dietary energy 
supply as a per&shy;cent&shy;age of the 
average dietary energy require&shy;ment. The latter is 
defined as the amount of dietary energy mea&shy;sured 
in kilo&shy;calories that is required 
by an indi&shy;vidual to maintain body functions, health, and normal activity, as 
noted earlier. The estimates of DES adequacy consider the age structure, sex, 
height, and level of physical activity of different indi&shy;viduals in each country.
<p></p>
The dietary energy available from cereals, roots, and 
tubers (kcal / capita / day) (percent, 3y average) is 
an important nutritional indicator because  items from these food groups are 
generally the least expensive. As a result, 
these staple foods are often a large part of 
the diet in low-income coun&shy;tries. 
Conse&shy;quently, the nutri&shy;ent density, dietary 
diversity, and micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent supply of 
these diets are  low as described in detail in Chapter&nbsp;8c.

<p></p>
As noted earlier, average protein supply 
(g / capita / day, 3&#8209;year average) provides insight 
into the nutritional quality of the food supply at the global, 
regional, or national level.
<p></p>
The average supply of pro&shy;tein of animal origin 
(g / capita / day, 3&#8209;year average) is an additional important 
indi&shy;cator of diet quality as animal-based 
pro&shy;teins contains all the essential 
amino acids. The supply of pro&shy;tein from animal-based sources  includes meat 
com&shy;modities, eggs, and dairy products, and fish and seafood, 
all mea&shy;sured in g / capita / day. Figure&nbsp;2.4 present the 
daily pro&shy;tein supply from animal and 
plant-based foods in 2020. The data from 1961 to 2019 show that there 
has been an increase in the share of 
total pro&shy;tein from animal-based sources in 
most coun&shy;tries since 1961 (Roser et&nbsp;al., 2013).    
<p></p>
Additional indi&shy;cators of the 
quality of the food supply based on FBS data have 
been devel&shy;oped by INDDEX in their Data4Diets platform. They include meat 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion (expressed as total 
kilograms per capita at the national level), 
national energy avail&shy;able 
from non-staples (i.e., all food items exclud&shy;ing grains 
and tubers), and national fruit and veg&shy;etable 
avail&shy;ability in the food supply. 
For more details, see INDDEX Project (2018).

<h3>2.1.1c  Macro&shy;nutri&shy;ent avail&shy;ability at the national level</h3>

Macro&shy;nutri&shy;ents include carbohydrate, 
pro&shy;tein, and fats, and are the major source 
of energy in the diet. Macro&shy;nutri&shy;ent 
supply per capita can be esti&shy;mated by 
combining supply data from FBSs 
expressed in g/capita/day with a food com&shy;posi&shy;tion 
database for all primary and processed food products, as noted earlier. A common 
global food com&shy;posi&shy;tion 
database avail&shy;able in FAO (2001a) is used to 
estimate the FAO nutri&shy;ent supply data. The source of the nutri&shy;ent 
com&shy;posi&shy;tion data in this 
global database is not cited and any 
differ&shy;ences in the nutri&shy;ent com&shy;posi&shy;tion of 
food items across coun&shy;tries is not considered.

As shown in Table&nbsp;2.1, 
the supply per capita for energy is 
expressed as kcal / capita / day, whereas 
the macro&shy;nutri&shy;ent supply per capita for both pro&shy;tein and 
fat are expressed as g / capita / day). 
Data are freely avail&shy;able by year and country 
from FAO (2021c).
<p></p>
Figure&nbsp;2.5 presents the global per capita supply of 
protein and shows that in lower-income coun&shy;tries 
the per capita pro&shy;tein supply in 2020 is about 60&#8209;80g / capita / day, 
whereas in most 
coun&shy;tries across Europe, North America, 
and Oceania, the per capita pro&shy;tein 
supply is greater than 100g / capita / day. 
<p></p>
The quality of the diet improves with the increased consumption
of protein-rich foods.
At the national level, the 
average pro&shy;tein supply pro&shy;vides an estimate of the 
pro&shy;tein supply per capita and 
thus insight into the nutri&shy;tional quality of the national food supply.
However, no infor&shy;mation on the avail&shy;ability 
of pro&shy;tein supply in nutri&shy;tionally vulnerable 
groups is provide by the FBS data.

</figcaption>
</figure>

In contrast to both energy as kcal / capita / day 
and pro&shy;tein g / capita / day, the per capita 
fat supply g / capita / day has increased across all regions during the period 1961 
to 2014, although over the last decade, the increase has slowed in North America, 
Europe, and Oceania. Regional differ&shy;ences 
in supply for fat are larger than that 
for either energy or pro&shy;tein, with the average capita fat supply in North 
America being almost three times as large 
as in Africa in 2019 (Figure 2.6) (Roser et&nbsp;al., 2013). 
<p></p>
Macro&shy;nutri&shy;ents are sometimes 
expressed as per&shy;cent&shy;age of total energy (e.g. 
per&shy;cent&shy;age of kilo&shy;calories from 
pro&shy;tein or fat) due to uncertainties in the data 
and process used to develop FBS. 
Values expressed in this way (i.e., as nutri&shy;ent 
density) are said to be much less influenced by age and sex in a popu&shy;lation. 
Moreover, assess&shy;ment of pro&shy;tein 
supply as pro&shy;tein density allows the quality of 
the diets to be compared across coun&shy;tries which 
have differing levels of accuracy 
of the food supply data, and thus differing levels of under / over estimation of 
total nutri&shy;ent per 
capita supply. Never&shy;the&shy;less, even comparison of the values for 
per&shy;cent&shy;age of energy as 
well as per&shy;cent&shy;age of energy from pro&shy;tein and fat (and 
any other nutri&shy;ent) derived from 
each food group across coun&shy;tries can be 
jeopardized by a differing level of under / over estimation between food groups. 
In some cases, values for the 
ratios of poly&shy;unsatu&shy;rated fatty acids to satu&shy;rated 
fatty acids (P:S) and un&shy;satu&shy;rated 
fatty acids to satu&shy;rated fatty acids (U:S) have 
also been used (Sasaki & Kesteloot, 1992) 
rather than per capita nutri&shy;ent supply. 

<h3>2.1.1d Micronutri&shy;ent avail&shy;ability at national level </h3>

Efforts have been made by several 
investigators to use FBS for the assess&shy;ment of the adequacy of 
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent supply at the global level, 
in different regions of the world, and 
in indi&shy;vidual coun&shy;tries. 
To accomplish this aim, FBS have been matched not only 
to energy, pro&shy;tein, and fat, 
but also to a full range of micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents. However, 
because the FAO FBS do not include data 
on the micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent supply per capita at 
the present time, investigators have 
compiled their own data on the micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent 
com&shy;posi&shy;tion of the food com&shy;modities listed in the FAO FBS
using data from food composition tables. 
<p></p>
As noted earlier, FAO FBS provide only national-level 
estimates per capita. This 
precludes the assess&shy;ment of per 
capita micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent supply that takes into 
account age and sex and the 
differing micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent needs
of the national population. However, by applying 
data from estimates on the age and sex 
distrib&shy;utions of the national popu&shy;lation 
in each country, the theoretical 
popu&shy;lation mean require&shy;ment for each micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent at 
the national level can be esti&shy;mated.  
From this, the per&shy;cent&shy;age of the popu&shy;lation 
at risk of inad&shy;equacy has been 
calcu&shy;lated, defined as the proportion of the 
popu&shy;lation with micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent intakes 
below the theoretical average micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent 
require&shy;ment of the popu&shy;lation. 
The popu&shy;lation distrib&shy;ution of intakes for each 
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent is 
inferred based on the assumed mean per capita micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent 
intake and coefficients of variation (CV) 
for each micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent (taken from the 
literature). The latter takes into account 
inter-indi&shy;vidual variation in micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent intakes 
arising from the inequities which affect access and avail&shy;ability of certain 
foods.  This approach of assessing risk of inad&shy;equacy is related to the 
Esti&shy;mated Average Require&shy;ment (EAR) 
cut-point method and described in Chapter&nbsp;8b for 
a popu&shy;lation. 
<p></p>
Several investigators have employed this approach to estimate risk of 
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent inad&shy;equacy 
based on FBS data. Wuehler et&nbsp;al. (2005) were the first 
investigators to compare the adequacy of the food supply to meet the theoretical 
popu&shy;lation mean require&shy;ment for zinc, 
based on FBS for 176 coun&shy;tries.

In this analysis, estimates of the 
absorb&shy;able zinc content of the national food supplies 
were derived from a global food com&shy;posi&shy;tion database compiled by the 
investigators, with zinc absorption predicted using a model devel&shy;oped by the 
International Zinc Nutri&shy;tion Consultative Group (IZiNCG).
In this study, the 
investigators compared the 
absorb&shy;able zinc content of the food supply with the 
popu&shy;lation theoretical mean 
<i>physio&shy;logical</i> require&shy;ment to estimate the per&shy;cent&shy;age 
of the popu&shy;lation at risk

In later publications, this same approach has been applied to assess the per 
capita avail&shy;ability of several 
other micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents in regions (e.g., Africa) 
(Joy et&nbsp;al., 2014) and 
South Asia (Mark et&nbsp;al., 2016), as well as in specific 
coun&shy;tries (Broadly et&nbsp;al., 2012; 
Arsenault et&nbsp;al., 2015; Watts et&nbsp;al., 2016). 
For example, in a study by Arsenault and co-workers 
FBS data from three coun&shy;tries 
(Bangladesh, Senegal, and Cameroon) were used to 
assess the per capita avail&shy;ability for 
eight micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents (vitamin&nbsp;A, 
vitamin&nbsp;C, vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, riboflavin, niacin, folate, 
calcium and zinc). Although a 
common food com&shy;posi&shy;tion database was compiled and 
used for all three coun&shy;tries, 
additional country-specific adjustments were made 
in this study to take 
into consid&shy;eration the in-country pro&shy;cess&shy;ing of staple 
foods, which lead to differ&shy;ences in the 
nutri&shy;ent com&shy;posi&shy;tion of ingested foods 
(e.g. per&shy;cent&shy;age of refined wheat 
at country level). Two indi&shy;cators of adequacy 
were assessed in this study: 
<ol>
<li>Per capita nutri&shy;ent supply 
expressed as a per&shy;cent&shy;age of the theoretical 
mean popu&shy;lation-adjusted nutri&shy;ent require&shy;ments for each country; 
<li>Per&shy;cent&shy;age of the popu&shy;lation 
that had an adequate usual intake, based on 
the assumed inter-person variability 
in micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent intakes obtained from the 
literature. 
</li></ol>
Each nutri&shy;ent gap in the food 
supply was also calcu&shy;lated as the 
differ&shy;ence between the current amount in the food 
supply minus the amount of the nutri&shy;ent needed to achieve 80% preva&shy;lence of 
adequate intakes. In this study, linear optimization modeling was also used to 
deter&shy;mine the 
optimal mix of crops to fill the 
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent gaps identified in each county and 
thus increase their micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent adequacy.

In an effort to overcome some of 
the lim&shy;ita&shy;tions of FBS data, notably their lack 
of infor&shy;mation on both indi&shy;vidual foods 
that are important in diets and actual 
intakes by age or sex, Smith et&nbsp;al. (2016) have con&shy;structed a new model: the 
Global Expanded Nutri&shy;ent Supply (GENuS) model to estimate per capita supply 
for 23&nbsp;indi&shy;vidual nutri&shy;ents across 225&nbsp;food groups 
for 34&nbsp;age&#8209;sex groups in 152&nbsp;coun&shy;tries. 
They also provide trends in national level data over50&nbsp;years 
(1961&#8209;2011). 
<p></p>
To achieve these objectives, the GENuS model combines FBS data with some 
ancillary data from indi&shy;vidual and house&shy;hold surveys at country level. This 
approach yields food supply estimates which consider both the edible weight of 
each food com&shy;modity and level of food fortification in 225 food groups. In each 
country an ad-hoc food com&shy;posi&shy;tion 
database was compiled based on six national 
and regional food com&shy;posi&shy;tion 
tables in which nutri&shy;ent losses during the 
pro&shy;cess&shy;ing of cereals to 
flour were considered. Age and sex-specific supplies of 
foods and nutri&shy;ents across 26&nbsp;age 
groups were calcu&shy;lated for each country. The 
distrib&shy;ution of nutri&shy;ent per capita 
supply by age and sex was derived through a 
probabilistic method (Monte Carlo simulations).  Finally, to assess validity, a 
comparison of the GENuS estimates of 
nutri&shy;ent supplies against USDA estimates was 
performed, which revealed very good agree&shy;ment 
for 21&nbsp;of 23&nbsp;nutri&shy;ents. For a 
discussion of the lim&shy;ita&shy;tions of the data used in the GENuS model, 
see Smith et&nbsp;al. (2016). 

<h3>2.2. Food avail&shy;able 
for con&shy;sump&shy;tion at the house&shy;hold level</h3>
 
House&shy;hold food con&shy;sump&shy;tion is defined as the total amount of 
food and beverages avail&shy;able for con&shy;sump&shy;tion in the house&shy;hold 
plus any foods prepared and consumed outside the house&shy;hold. 
House&shy;hold surveys are of two types: 
<ol>
<li>House&shy;hold Food Con&shy;sump&shy;tion Surveys (HFCS). These were devel&shy;oped in the 1980s 
as an alternative to surveys at the indi&shy;vidual level, and provide measurements of 
food con&shy;sump&shy;tion in the house&shy;hold. 
<li>House&shy;hold Con&shy;sump&shy;tion and 
Expenditure Surveys (HCES). In these surveys, food 
avail&shy;able for con&shy;sump&shy;tion is mea&shy;sured. 
</li></ol>
These household surveys are widely 
used to inform on global food security and poverty, particularly 
in low&#8209; and middle-income economies. 
Such surveys can also be con&shy;ducted in 
institu&shy;tions such as those for institu&shy;tionalized elderly.
Increasingly, HCES are also being used to 
estimate &ldquo;nutrient intakes&rdquo;, despite the potential errors and 
imprecision that may occur using this method. In view of these  challenges,  
the terms &ldquo;nutrient supply&rdquo; at the household level 
and &ldquo;apparent nutrient intake&rdquo; at the indi&shy;vidual level are often used.
<p></p>
In the past, some surveys similar to HFCS or HCES were 
con&shy;ducted in high-income coun&shy;tries with the objective of assessing food 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion at the house&shy;hold level. 
They were based on a record of food 
quantities entering the house&shy;hold, either purchased, received as gifts, or 
produced for house&shy;hold use, 
over a reference period, often seven days. 
They used the &ldquo;food account method&rdquo; 
(Burk & Pao, 1976; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 2000), the 
&ldquo;list-recall method&rdquo; (USDA,1993), or 
the &ldquo;food inventory method&rdquo; (Turrini et&nbsp;al., 2001). 
Food con&shy;sump&shy;tion by indi&shy;vidual members of the 
house&shy;hold was often recorded as an additional component of the 
survey. This approach led to an increased burden on the sampled house&shy;holds, 
resulting in some cases in a low response rate (USDA,1993). Such surveys 
are now rare and have been replaced by food con&shy;sump&shy;tion surveys at the 
indi&shy;vidual level.
<p></p>
During HFCS and HCES, data on acquisition and/or expenditure and/or 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion of com&shy;modities 
including foods and beverages are collected. HFCS 
and HCES are less expensive than indi&shy;vidual 
food con&shy;sump&shy;tion surveys and 
require a lower burden for participants. However, many of the technical problems 
and lim&shy;ita&shy;tions of house&shy;hold 
surveys are the same as those of dietary 
surveys conducted at the individual level, which are discussed in detail in 
Chapters&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5. For example, diet might 
be altered by the design of the survey or the recording process. 
<p></p>
Typically, HFCS and HCES are con&shy;ducted 
on a large nationally rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;tative 
sample of house&shy;holds (Fiedler et&nbsp;al., 2012), and include the collection 
of infor&shy;mation on demographic 
and socio&shy;economic characteristics of the house&shy;hold, 
thereby enabling data to be presented in terms of income 
level, family size, region of the country, etc. Attention must be paid to the 
sampling design of these surveys to 
ensure that a rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;tative national 
sample is obtained; see details on sampling methods in  
Chapter&nbsp;1, section&nbsp;1.4.2. The 
sampling design should account for the influence of 
season, holidays, weekends, socio&shy;economic 
status, and region on food con&shy;sump&shy;tion 
patterns to ensure infor&shy;mation on the 
true mean food con&shy;sump&shy;tion and the diverse 
food con&shy;sump&shy;tion pattern of a popu&shy;lation is obtained.

<h3>2.2.1. House&shy;hold food con&shy;sump&shy;tion surveys (HFCS)</h3>

House&shy;hold Food Con&shy;sump&shy;tion Surveys measure all food 
and beverages consumed within a house&shy;hold during a 
specified period. They require careful supervision by the interviewer and good 
cooperation of the respon&shy;dents. In general, these surveys are more complicated 
and costly to undertake than HCES and hence were often con&shy;ducted infrequently. 
Such surveys are rarely per&shy;formed today. 
Instead, they have been replaced by
surveys of food con&shy;sump&shy;tion at the 
indi&shy;vidual level (see Chapter&nbsp;3). Two methods &mdash; weighed food records 
and house&shy;hold 24hr recalls &mdash; were used in the past 
to measure the house&shy;hold food con&shy;sump&shy;tion.
<p></p>
<b>Weighed house&shy;hold food records</b>
<p></p>
For this method, the food eaten by the house&shy;hold 
is recorded using weighed food 
records (also called food diaries). These are usually 
completed over at least a 
1wk period, by either the house&shy;holder or a fieldworker. 
During the survey period, the weight 
or volume of each food consumed at each meal is recorded, before subdivision 
into indi&shy;vidual helpings (Burk & Pao, 1976). Detailed descriptions of all foods, 
including brand names, and their method of preparation are recorded. For 
composite dishes, the amount of each raw ingre&shy;dient used in the recipe and the 
final weight of the prepared composite dish is also recorded. In some surveys the 
plate waste from each meal is collected and separated 
so that waste for indi&shy;vidual food 
items can be weighed and recorded.  Generally 
however, kitchen and plate waste, and food 
fed to pets, is not accounted for in this method, and instead an arbitrary 
wastage factor is applied.
<p></p>
<b>House&shy;hold 24-h recalls</b>
<p></p>
In this method, the house&shy;hold member responsible for the food preparation is 
interviewed to obtain infor&shy;mation on 
both house&shy;hold com&shy;posi&shy;tion and house&shy;hold 
food con&shy;sump&shy;tion over 
the previous 24h period. In the first stage of the 
interview, infor&shy;mation is collected 
on the dishes and ingredients con&shy;sumed, 
followed by details on the quantity, focusing particularly on those foods that 
are important sources of energy.  
A technical guide for measuring house&shy;hold 
food con&shy;sump&shy;tion using a 24h recall 
was devel&shy;oped by Swindale & Ohri-Vachaspati (1999). 
This guide pro&shy;vides detailed 
instructions and sample questionnaires that can be used to collect the data, 
quantify the portion sizes of food consumed, and analyze the results.

<h3>2.2.2  House&shy;hold Con&shy;sump&shy;tion and Expenditure surveys</h3>

House&shy;hold Con&shy;sump&shy;tion and Expen&shy;diture 
Surveys (HCES) are typically 
performed within House&shy;hold Expen&shy;diture 
Surveys (HES), i.e. economic surveys 
designed to inform national economic policy and usually imple&shy;mented by 
national statistical agencies. 
<p></p>
HCES are less costly than HFCS and are widely used in low-income settings 
(FAO, 2023). They are usually con&shy;ducted every 3&#8209;5y 
and cover 7,000 to 20,000 
house&shy;holds in a country to provide a 
statistically rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;tative sample. 
HCES refer to a 
heterogeneous group of complex surveys which include House&shy;hold Income Expen&shy;diture 
Surveys (HIES), National House&shy;hold Budget Surveys (NHBS),
and Living Standards Measure&shy;ment Surveys (LSMS). The latter (i.e, LSMS) are 
multi-topic surveys which are provided with technical assistance 
by the World Bank's Living Standard Measure&shy;ment Study (LSMS) group. 
<p></p>
HCES were designed primarily to measure house&shy;hold food avail&shy;able for 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion in a reference period 
through the expenditure approach (i.e., the 
monetary value of the food). Over time, quantities of foods and beverages have 
also been collected in an effort to repurpose the surveys so they can serve other 
needs such as monitoring house&shy;hold-level food security. This has led to 
improvements in survey design to capture food data of a higher quality
by including a more detailed food component module.  
<p></p>
Some HCES based on the concept of acquisition, collected data on food entering the 
house&shy;holds acquired through 
purchases, own-produc&shy;tion, and in&#8209;kind, 
on the assumption that there were no 
major changes in house&shy;hold stocks during the survey period. An important 
lim&shy;ita&shy;tion of this 
simplified method&shy;ology is related to the fact that some foods 
(e.g. grains) are not perishable and can be stored. Conse&shy;quently, if the survey 
was con&shy;ducted in a period of 
drawing-down stocks to meet current con&shy;sump&shy;tion, 
house&shy;hold con&shy;sump&shy;tion 
would be underesti&shy;mated. On the contrary, if the survey was 
con&shy;ducted in a period of 
accumulating stocks for later con&shy;sump&shy;tion, house&shy;hold 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion would be 
overesti&shy;mated (Smith et&nbsp;al., 2014). As a result, use of 
these simplified HCES is no longer 
recom&shy;mended. Alternatively, a combination of 
acquisition and con&shy;sump&shy;tion data 
can be collected in the HCES so that both food 
acquired through purchases and 
consumed from own-produc&shy;tion and transfer are reported.  
<p></p>
Food con&shy;sump&shy;tion estimates 
gener&shy;ated from acquisition data or a combination of 
both acquisition and con&shy;sump&shy;tion data are usually referred to as 
&ldquo;apparent con&shy;sump&shy;tion&rdquo; 
or &ldquo;food avail&shy;able for con&shy;sump&shy;tion&rdquo; 
to distinguish it from actual 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion (Fiedler & Mwangi, 2016). Data collected in HCES on food 
avail&shy;able for con&shy;sump&shy;tion are quite often 
used as a proxy for the quantities eaten.
<p></p>
HCES vary in their complexity and respondent burden. Data may be collected 
through a food diary, recall, or a list, with a reference period usually ranging 
from seven days to one month. When a list is used,   the food and food groups 
specified varies, and when the list is short, the aggregated food items often 
lack the details needed to match 
the food items correctly with a food com&shy;posi&shy;tion 
database. Food and beverages wasted, spoiled, or fed to pets or livestock are 
frequently not taken into account, although in some cases, waste may be weighed 
or a wastage factor applied. 
<p></p>
In general, in the past the capture of food and beverages prepared and consumed 
outside the home has also been poor in most HCES, although there is now a trend 
to improve the recording of the 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion of these items. For example, in some 
recent HCES a special module has been added to collect personal expenditure on 
snacks, meals, sweets, and drinks consumed outside the home. Adjustments are also 
made in some HCES for the presence of non-house&shy;hold members during the survey 
period. Ideally HCES should report all sources of food con&shy;sump&shy;tion, either 
purchased, received as gifts, or produced for house&shy;hold use.
<p></p>
Variations in the survey designs of 
HCES across coun&shy;tries and over time within 
coun&shy;tries has created many challenges. 
To understand the implications of these 
variations on the accuracy and 
consistency of con&shy;sump&shy;tion measurements, a field 
study was con&shy;ducted in Tanzania in 2007 and 2008 
in which con&shy;sump&shy;tion estimates 
in 4,000 house&shy;holds was mea&shy;sured via eight different HCES survey designs, 
selected to capture the most common 
designs used in practice (Beegle et&nbsp;al.,2010). 
The effect of variations according to 
survey length, use of a house&shy;hold diary 
versus recall format, and level of detail of 
food items listed in the HCES on over- and
under-reporting was investigated, using frequently supervised personal 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion diaries as the “gold standard”. 
<p></p>
The characteristics of 
the study popu&shy;lation, notably whether 
they were illiterate or largely urban, 
was found to affect the magnitude of the 
under&shy;estimate of con&shy;sump&shy;tion 
using the house&shy;hold diary method. For the recall 
method, the investigators recom&shy;mended 
the use of a full long list of food com&shy;modities to 
recall within a reference period of 1 or 2 weeks rather than using a shorter 
recall list by aggre&shy;gating the number of 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion categories. In summary, 
over&#8209; and under-reporting appeared to 
depend on the specific setting and varied with 
traits such as the literacy of the household, the share of 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion from home produc&shy;tion, dietary diversity, 
and fraction of meals eaten in the house&shy;hold as opposed to private food 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion in restaurants (Beegle et&nbsp;al.,2010).  
<p></p>
The findings of Beegle et&nbsp;al. (2010) highlighted the need to improve the quality 
and utility of the food data components of the HCES surveys so they were more 
relevant to nutri&shy;tionists and food security analysts, and the impor&shy;tance of 
harmonizing the HCES survey method&shy;ology. Conse&shy;quently, a desk review of survey 
questionnaires and methods used in 
100 avail&shy;able HCES surveys from low&#8209; and middle-income coun&shy;tries was con&shy;ducted to 
identify key areas for improvement (Smith et&nbsp;al., 2014).

</div>
Five areas in the food 
data component of HCES surveys were 
selected for inves&shy;ti&shy;gation; these are 
summarized in Box&nbsp;2.4. For a 
detailed discussion of the measure&shy;ment error 
patterns that were identified within 
each of these five areas, see Zezza et&nbsp;al. (2017).
As an example, a major challenge has 
been the rise in the con&shy;sump&shy;tion of food 
away from home, a trend that has accom&shy;panied 
the nutri&shy;tion transition over the 
last decades in both developing and 
devel&shy;oped coun&shy;tries. Such data may include 
food that is purchased (e.g., from a street stall or restaurant), and/or received 
in kind (e.g., provided via food assistance or a gift etc). Snacks have also 
become an increasingly important part of the diet and may make up a large 
proportion of food consumed away from home. 
<p></p>
Food away from home can refer to food produced outside the home such as takeout 
meals, irrespective of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. 
Alternatively, food away from home can refer to food consumed outside regardless 
of the origin of the food. Examples of this scenario includes homemade meals 
consumed at work or school.  The FAO and the World Bank 2018 have outlined a 
method for defining food away from home, as shown in Figure&nbsp;2.9.  
<p></p>

</figcaption>
</figure> 

For nutri&shy;tion and food security analysis, 
an additional challenge, not 
captured in Figure&nbsp;2.9, is acquiring 
infor&shy;mation on what was eaten.  Such details must
often be secured from other sources. Several low&#8209; and middle-income 
coun&shy;tries have devel&shy;oped innovative 
approaches to secure these details; see Annex&nbsp;2 
in FAO/World Bank (2018) for more details.

Table&nbsp;2.5 presents data on food consumed away from home based on data collected 
from the 100 HCES surveys examined by Smith et&nbsp;al. (2014). 
Such data may include food that 
is purchased (e.g., from a street stall or restaurant) and/or received in kind 
(e.g., provided via food assistance or a gift etc). Snacks have also become an 
increasingly important part of the diet and can make up a large proportion of 
food consumed away from home. As shown in Table&nbsp;2.5, 
although most of the surveys collected data on food 
consumed away from home, the detail with which the data were collected was very 
poor. 

<p></p>
In view of the many challenges experienced in collecting the food data component 
of HCES surveys, and the recom&shy;men&shy;dations 
proposed by several investigators 
(Carletto, Zezza & Banerjee, 2013; Smith et&nbsp;al., 
2014; Zezza et&nbsp;al, 2017), guide&shy;lines to 
improve the quality of data collected
have been devel&shy;oped by FAO and the World

These guidelines take into consid&shy;eration the best balance between accuracy and 
cost effec&shy;tive&shy;ness. For more 
details on the recom&shy;men&shy;dations specified for each 
domain and their justification, see FAO and World Bank (2018). Low&#8209; and 
middle-income coun&shy;tries are recom&shy;mended 
to adopt these guidelines to improve the 
quality of the food data component collected in HCES and standardize the 
method&shy;ology across coun&shy;tries.

<h3>2.3.1 Uses of house&shy;hold surveys</h3>

Increasingly, HCES are being repurposed so that the data gener&shy;ated are not only 
used by economists for monitoring poverty, calculating national accounts, and as 
an input for consumer price indices, but also by food security analysts and 
nutri&shy;tionists for nutri&shy;tion-related  
analyses (Box&nbsp;2.6), based on the food con&shy;sump&shy;tion 
module of the HCES surveys (Smith et&nbsp;al., 2014;  FAO and the World Bank,2018). 
As noted earlier, FAO (1996) has defined &ldquo;Food Security&rdquo; 
as <blockquote>&ldquo;a state in which all 
people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and 
nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active 
and healthy life&rdquo;</blockquote>

The World Bank has devel&shy;oped the most 
comprehensive repository of publicly available worldwide 
<a href ="https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/home"> HCES data</a>.
An additional resource on HCES surveys is also avail&shy;able at the International 
House&shy;hold Survey Network
<a href ="https://www.ihsn.org/">(HSN)</a>.
<p></p>
Several resources are avail&shy;able to derive food security and nutri&shy;tion indi&shy;cators as well as nutrient-based indicators
based on the food module 
of HCES surveys. Of these, two resources 
itemized below provide details of their methods of con&shy;struction, uses,
strengths and weaknesses.
<p class="clearleft">
<ul><li>

</li></ul>
Readers are advised to consult these two resources. A selection of 
indi&shy;cators designed to assess food security and nutri&shy;tion 
are summarized in Box&nbsp;2.7,
whereas details of indicators designed to 
characterize dietary micronutrient supply are presented in Box 2.8.
When compiling these indi&shy;cators, 
the term &ldquo;apparent consumption&rdquo; 
of foods&rdquo; and &ldquo;nutrient supply&rdquo; at the household level 
and &ldquo;apparent nutrient intake&rdquo; 
at the indi&shy;vidual level rather than &ldquo;intake&rdquo; are used. 
None of these indi&shy;cators permit 
measure&shy;ment at the indi&shy;vidual level.

<b>Box&nbsp;2.7 Selected Indi&shy;cators of Food Security and Nutri&shy;tion</b>
<p></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 5px; ">
<li><b>Preva&shy;lence of Under&shy;nourish&shy;ment </b> (PoU percent)
is used by FAO to monitor the state of food insecurity in the 
world and is published routinely in 
the State of Food Insecurity (SOFI), an annual 
report by FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO (2022).
Data from HCES surveys pro&shy;vides 
the variability (ie., CV) in the distrib&shy;ution of 
house&shy;hold per capita dietary 
energy con&shy;sump&shy;tion which is the compared with the 
weighted average of normative capita Minimum Dietary Energy Require&shy;ment (MDER).
To estimate MDER, factors such as the age structure, sex, height, and activity 
levels of indi&shy;viduals within each country are applied. Using the variation in 
intake (i.e. CV) and energy require&shy;ments, 
under&shy;nourish&shy;ment can be calcu&shy;lated.
Updated instructions related to the estimation of PoU using HCES data are 
avail&shy;able:
<a href ="https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=386"> FAO e-learning course</a>

<li><b>Depth of Food Deficit </b> (kcal/capita)
represents the average per capita 
amount of additional energy (kcals) needed for 
undernourished indi&shy;viduals to meet the Average Dietary Energy Require&shy;ment (ADER).
The Depth of Food Deficit is used to understand the degree of food insecurity in 
a county and compare the magnitude across coun&shy;tries. 
It does not measure dietary quality.
For this estimate, the FAO probabilistc cut-point method 
is applied; see Moltedo et&nbsp;al. (2022) for more details. 
Details on the calculation of this indi&shy;cator are avail&shy;able 
in INDDEX and Cafiero (2014) Advances in 
hunger measurement at: Global_Food_Security.pdf

<li><b>Balanced Diet Indi&shy;cator</b> is a measure of 
dietary quality and defined as
the proportion of popu&shy;lation with access to a balanced diet. 
For this, house&shy;holds are classified according to whether their dietary energy 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion from sources of 
pro&shy;tein, fat, and carbohydrate are below, within, or 
above recom&shy;mended thresholds (i.e., pro&shy;tein, 10-15%; fat, 15-30%; total 
carbohydrate, 55-75%).
When significant proportions of the popu&shy;lation fall outside 
these thresholds, then 
there is a possibility of adverse consequences associated with chronic diseases 
within a country.

<li><b>HCES Dietary Diversity Score  (HCES HDDS)</b>
is associated with the  
likelihood of nutri&shy;ent adequacy. 
HDDS is used to assess economic access to food, to estimate food groups 
available for consumption by the 
house&shy;hold, or to assess how interventions designed to 
increase 
house&shy;hold income affect food available for con&shy;sump&shy;tion.
Consists of a simple unweighted count of 16&nbsp;food groups acquired/consumed by a 
house&shy;hold during the survey period of the food module. 
An estimate of the average HDDS at the national and 
sub-national levels can also be derived from 
the weighted median of house&shy;hold scores.

<li><b>House&shy;hold Adequacy of Fruit and Veg&shy;etable Con&shy;sump&shy;tion </b>
expressed as g per capita per day,  
pro&shy;vides a measure of diet quality and 
an under&shy;standing of dietary patterns. It is
used to identify inad&shy;equacy of fruit 
and veg&shy;etable con&shy;sump&shy;tion across coun&shy;tries 
and for subgroups based on house&shy;hold 
income, gender of head of house&shy;hold, 
geographical area etc. 
For this indi&shy;cator, the 
total weight in grams of fruit and veg&shy;etables consumed by 
the house&shy;hold is 
divided first by the number of house&shy;hold 
members, followed by the days of survey reference period.
\[\small \mbox {&ge;&nbsp;400g/capita/day (i.e., 5 servings) &equals; adequate}\]
\[\small \mbox {&lt;&nbsp;400g/capita/day &equals; inadequate}\]
<p></p> 
Table&nbsp;2.6 presents a comparison on apparent 
fruit and veg&shy;etable con&shy;sump&shy;tion 
(edible g / capita / day) from HCES data by income 
quintile in five coun&shy;tries and shows that 
apparent fruit and veg&shy;etable con&shy;sump&shy;tion

<h3>Indicators designed to characterize dietary nutrient supply</h3>

Additional indi&shy;cators designed to quantify, characterize, and 
evaluate the adequacy of household micronutrient supply across populations
have also been compiled. These indi&shy;cators are
calcu&shy;lated by first multiplying the edible amounts of the food
com&shy;modities listed in the food supply module of the HCES survey and said to be
avail&shy;able for con&shy;sump&shy;tion (not 
the actual intake) for each house&shy;hold,
with their corre&shy;sponding nutri&shy;ent 
content derived from food com&shy;posi&shy;tion
tables (FCTs) (mostly for the raw form of the food before preparation). 
The data generated are termed &ldquo;micro&shy;nutrient supply&rdquo;.
The nutri&shy;ents included are the essential amino acids, 
vitamins&nbsp;B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, 
and&nbsp;C, folate, total vitamin&nbsp;A (expressed as both
Retinal Equivalents and Retinol Activity Equivalents), zinc, calcium,
and total iron. In addition, heme
iron, expressed as a per&shy;cent&shy;age of total iron, 
can also be esti&shy;mated.
<p></p>
Several investigators have compared the estimates of 
apparent nutrient intake derived from HCES data with 
those obtained with indi­vidual dietary assessment methods.
In a systematic review of 
five studies, Tang et al. (2022) concluded that in 
general nutrient intakes were overestimated 
using HCES food consumption data. For some of the studies, 
discrepancies were large compared with the 
estimates from indi­vidual dietary assessment methods. 
For a discussion of the possible reasons for 
the poor agree­ment, see Tang et al. (2022).
<p></p>
Apparent micronutrient intake per capita per day and per adult-male 
equivalent per day as well as micronutrient density can be
esti&shy;mated at the national level,
and disaggregated into categories when they can be used to monitor or identify
target popu&shy;lations for policy makers. The categories that can be
included depends on the house&shy;hold socio-economic
characteristics collected in the HCES in the country 
and may include education, income, geography, and ruralness. 
Examples of these indi&shy;cators disaggregated by region,
urban-rural areas, and quintile of income are given in Box&nbsp;2.8.

</li></ul>
* Depending on the household characteristics collected in the HCES data, national
and regional data can also be disaggregated by category of socio-economic 
group, education, house&shy;hold size, etc.
</div>

In the past, attempts to assess micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent adequacy from HCES
survey data esti&shy;mated ratios of apparent micronutrient intake per capita
to the average weighted micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent 
require&shy;ment at the popu&shy;lation level.
These ratios provided a gross indication of issues with regard to
meeting require&shy;ments of selected micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents at the popu&shy;lation
level, but provided no infor&shy;mation on the preva&shy;lence of inadequate
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent intakes in the popu&shy;lation (Moltedo et&nbsp;al. 2018). 
<p></p>
Conse&shy;quently, recently efforts have been made to estimate the
preva&shy;lence of nutri&shy;ent inad&shy;equacy (PoNI) in the popu&shy;lation based on
HCES survey data. The new method extends the FAO probabilistic 
cut-point method used earlier to 
estimate chronic dietary energy inad&shy;equacy
to include micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents.  To achieve this
objective, the data gener&shy;ated on 
apparent micronutrient intake per day at the indi&shy;vidual level
must first be pre-adjusted to yield the distrib&shy;ution
of apparent usual micro&shy;nutrient intakes
by removing the excess variation due to both within-person
day-to-day variability and seasonal variability. 
After these preadjustments, the distrib&shy;ution
of apparent usual intake levels is compared to a threshold to estimate
PoNI. The threshold is based on the weighted average of the esti&shy;mated
average require&shy;ment (EAR) for the micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent 
under study for each sex-age group in the popu&shy;lation.
<p></p>
The prevalence of inadequacy for eight micronutrients: 
vitamins&nbsp;A, &nbsp;B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, 
and&nbsp;C, and calcium
and zinc based on pre-treated household survey data versus 
individual level dietary data from Bangladesh has been 
compared by Moltedo et al. (2022).  Their estimates of 
inadequacy from the household survey data compared with the 
individual-level data in which the conventional EAR 
cut-point method was applied, appeared promising. 
Nevertheless, more research is needed to guide 
the use of HCES  to estimate apparent nutrient intake at the 
individual level and prevalence of inadequacy.
Detailed instructions for estimating these indictors based on nutri&shy;ent
analysis from FCTs and the new FAO
probabilistic cut-point method, respectively,  are avail&shy;able at:

Special attention must also be given to the choice of the 
food composition tables used for
the micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent analysis. For discussion of
some of the lim&shy;ita&shy;tions of the 
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent values in food com&shy;posi&shy;tion
tables, consult Section&nbsp;1.2 in the above ADePT-FSM Version&nbsp;3 Software.
Note that this version of the ADePT software also
permits an assess&shy;ment of the 
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent content in foods consumed
away from home.

Gr&uuml;nberger K. (2014) compared 
per capita food supply based on country-specific 
FBS with that of 64 HCESs from 51 low&#8209; 
and middle-income coun&shy;tries, for 16&nbsp;major 
food groups. Overall, the results 
suggested that the esti&shy;mated differ&shy;ences in the 
average total food supply per capita are moderate. However, under&shy;estimates for 
the contribution of the average con&shy;sump&shy;tion of cereals, eggs, fish products, 
pulses and veg&shy;etables are likely, whereas 
overshy;estimates for fruits, meat, milk, 
and sugar products are probable. These findings suggest that con&shy;sider&shy;able 
uncertainty may exist in the estimates for 
the avail&shy;ability for con&shy;sump&shy;tion of 
single food groups at country and global level.

<h3>2.5 National and house&shy;hold surveys in the 
global assess&shy;ment of food security 
and diet quality by age and sex </h3>

Where feasible, it is preferablr to use quantitative food con&shy;sump&shy;tion data 
collected at the <i>indi&shy;vidual level</i> 
to assess the distrib&shy;ution of usual intakes of 
both food and nutri&shy;ents in 
different popu&shy;lation groups within a country. In this 
way, the adequacy of the nutri&shy;ent intakes at the popu&shy;lation level can be 
evaluated using the methods described in Chapter&nbsp;8b. 
Such quantitative data from food con&shy;sump&shy;tion 
surveys collected at the indi&shy;vidual 
level can be accessed from the 
<a href ="https://www.fao.org/gift-indi&shy;vidual-food-consumption/en/">FAO/WHO GIFT platform</a>.
<p></p>
However, currently, quantitative 
national food con&shy;sump&shy;tion data collected at the 
indi&shy;vidual level are only avail&shy;able 
for a few low&#8209; and middle-income coun&shy;tries. 
Therefore, to fill this gap, alternative global databases based on infor&shy;mation 
synthesized from FBS, HCES surveys, and indi&shy;vidual-level surveys (where possible) 
have been compiled. Such databases are capable of modeling worldwide indi&shy;vidual 
intakes of foods and nutri&shy;ents across the life-span with the goal of improving 
health of the most vulnerable popu&shy;lations through improved diets. Examples 
of these synthesized global databases
include the Global Dietary Database (GDD) and a database devel&shy;oped by the 
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) discussed briefly below. 
<p></p>
<a href ="https://www.globaldietarydatabase.org/"><b>The GDD database</b></a>
pro&shy;vides modeled data in 185 coun&shy;tries for 55 dietary factors 
including 14&nbsp;foods, 7&nbsp; beverages, 
15&nbsp;macro&shy;nutri&shy;ents, 19&nbsp;micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents, and two 
indices of carbohydrate quality. The FoodEx2 platform is used to standardize the 
description and classification of foods into food groups. Modeled data are 
provided by country, year of primary data collection, age across the life span, 
sex, education level, urban or rural residence, and pregnancy/nursing status. The 
GDD modeled estimates can also be used to compile global patterns of healthy and 
unhealthy diets together with indi&shy;cators such as the Healthy Eating Index and the 
Mediterranean Diet Score, Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDDW) and for 
Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF). See Chapter&nbsp;8c for more details of 
these indi&shy;cators.

<b>The IHME initiative database</b></a>
provides modeled data by country, age, sex and year of primary data 
collection in 204&nbsp;coun&shy;tries for 
87&nbsp;indi&shy;cators, including 15&nbsp;dietary indi&shy;cators 
(9&nbsp;foods and 6&nbsp;nutri&shy;ents). 
These dietary indi&shy;cators are included in 
the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), a worldwide observational 
epidemiological study that tracks the progress within and between coun&shy;tries of 
the changing health challenges. For example, Qiao et&nbsp;al. (2022) investigated the 
global burden of non-communicable diseases attributable to dietary 
risks from 1990&#8209;2019. They reported a
high intake of sodium and low intake of whole grains and fruits were leading 
dietary risks for deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide, 
especially in developing coun&shy;tries and among males. Their findings highlight 
the need to raise public awareness of interventions and improve dietary practices 
aimed to reduce the disease burden caused by suboptimal dietary intake, 
especially in developing coun&shy;tries and among males.

Data from the GBD study are also used to monitor progress in coun&shy;tries at the 
national and subnational level towards meeting the United Nations 33 
health-related Sustainable Devel&shy;opment Goals. Key research papers based on the 
global health estimates from the analysis of GBD data 
are published each year in a special issue of
