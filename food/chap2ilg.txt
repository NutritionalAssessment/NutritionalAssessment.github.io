ASSESSMENT OF FOOD AVAILABLE FOR CONSUMPTION AT
THE NATIONAL AND HOUSEHOLD LEVELS

Abstract

This chapter describes how National Food Balance Sheets (FBSs) and 
Household Surveys allow a quantitative assessment of food available for 
consumption at national and household levels respectively. Data are expressed as 
per capita food supply for human consumption and can be used to estimate per 
capita food intakes and, through matching with food composition data, per capita 
energy and nutrient intakes. 

Food Balance Sheets are calculated from national food production, plus imports, 
plus food taken from stocks. Exports and food added to stocks are then subtracted 
to obtain an estimate of gross country's food supply. The estimate of food 
diverted for non-human uses (e.g. animal feed, seed, non-food use) and of food 
loss up to retail level are subtracted from the gross country's food supply to 
obtain the net country's food supply (i.e. total food available for human 
consumption in a country at the retail level). FBSs are particularly precious for 
low-income countries where household food consumption surveys and individual 
food consumption surveys are not performed regularly on a representative sample 
of the population. Food Balance Sheets provide no information on the distribution 
within the countries (in terms of geographical areas or socio-economic groups) 
and on its distribution according to seasons. 

In contrast, household surveys may provide information on 
household food consumption 
within the countries (in terms of geographical areas or socio-economic groups) 
and on its distribution according to seasons. Household food consumption is the 
food and beverages available for consumption by the household, family group, or 
institution. It is defined as the total amount of food and beverages available for 
consumption in the household or prepared and consumed outside the household. 
Household surveys are of two types, surveys where food consumption is measured 
(Household Food Consumption Surveys (HFCS) and those more widely used in 
low- and middle-income economies to inform on global food security and poverty 
where food available for consumption is measured (Household Consumption and 
Expenditure Surveys (HCES). Efforts have recently been made to improve and 
harmonize household surveys.

Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) at national level is based on FBSs, 
making use of HBS. It is a key indicator to assess food insecurity at global level.

National and Household surveys provide no information on the availability of 
food/nutrients according to age, sex and physiological status. Interpreting data 
collected through such surveys in terms of nutritional adequacy of the diet 
without complementing them with data collected at individual level is highly 
uncertain. 

============================================ end of abstract

The food available for human consumption by a population
is best assessed by a national survey, with the 
resulting data expressed as per capita food supply. Such 
data can then be used to estimate per capita food intakes and per capita nutrient 
intakes. Food and nutriet intakes can also be estimated from household surveys. 
The term that should be used for data 
derived from most of these national and 
household surveys is either "food supply" or 
"food available for consumption" rather than "food consumption". Only a few 
types of household surveys measure actual food consumed.

Chapter 3 provides a details of the methods 
suitable for measuring food consumption at the individual level.
In contrast, the present chapter considers 
survey methods suitable for a quantitative 
assessment of food available for consumption/consumed at national and 
household levels.

Note that per capita food supply for human consumption, assessed 
through surveys at national level, provide no information on its distribution 
within the countries (in terms of geographical areas or socio-economic groups) 
and on its availability according to season. 
In contrast, per capita food supply and per capita 
food consumption assessed through surveys at household level may provide 
information on its distribution within the 
countries, in terms of geographical areas 
or socio-economic groups, and on its distribution according to seasons. 
However, it provides no information on its distribution 
within the household according to 
individual characteristics which determine 
nutrient needs - typically age, sex, body 
weight, physical activity level and physiological status. 

Methods designed to estimate the exposure to 
hazardous substances even though they 
are sometimes based on food supply at household 
level are not described. Similarly, methods suitable for 
qualitative assessment, such as food frequency or 
food diversity instruments, or methods using Universal Product Codes 
(UPCs) are not considered here.

2.1 Measurement of food available for consumption at the national level: 
Food balance sheets

Food balance sheets (FBS) are particularly important in countries where household 
food consumption surveys and individual food consumption surveys are not 
performed regularly on a representative sample of the population. 
This is the case for some low-income countries. 

Several terms have been used to describe FBSs. These include "country's food 
supply", "national food accounts", "food moving into consumption", "food 
consumption statistics", "food disappearance data", "food available for 
consumption" and "consumption level estimates". Here the term 
"country's food supply" is used. 

FBSs present a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply 
during a specified reference period: the calendar year, 
the agricultural year or the 
crop year (FAO, 2021c). The sources of supply 
and its utilization are reported for 
each food item potentially available for human consumption, including primary 
commodities such as soybeans and processed commodities such as oil of 
soyabean. 

The country's food supply is calculated from national food production, plus 
imports, plus food taken from stocks. Exports and food added to stocks are then 
subtracted to obtain an estimate of gross country's food supply. The estimate of 
food diverted for non-human uses (e.g. animal feed, seed, non-food use) and of 
food loss are then subtracted from the gross country's food supply to 
obtain the net country's food supply, i.e. the total food available for human 
consumption in a country at the retail level (FAO 2021d).

For the purposes of the FBS, "food loss" closely aligns with "post-harvest / post-
slaughter loss". It represents the quantity of food that leaves the 
production / supply chain at any stage, e.g., during production, processing and 
distribution, up to the retail level (FAO 2021a). Food loss may be considerable in 
countries where the agricultural products reach the consumer after travelling long 
distance and / or passing through several 
intermediaries prior to retail. In 
such cases, large amounts of food are lost because of damage, especially for 
perishable foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables or 
processed foods with a short 
shelf life. Assumptions about losses may be based 
on expert opinion obtained in the 
countries. Losses or waste at the retailer, food catering and household level are 
not considered in the compilation of FBS. Hence, total food availability 
estimates derived from the FBS are likely to be higher than average food 
consumed at the household level.

In some cases, information on country's stocks 
is not available. The effect of this 
data gap is reduced by preparing FBSs as a moving average for 3-year periods  
for all countries (https://www.fao.org/economic/the-statistics-division-
ess/publications-studies/publications/food-balance-sheets/zh/ )

Both official and unofficial data are used for compilation of FBSs; National 
statistical offices constitute an important data source. 
However, directly measured 
data on food availability at national level 
may be difficult to obtain (FAO, 2021a) 
and FBS compilers often derive estimates of food availability by making certain 
adjustments based on other existing data sets that measure food production or 
consumption. Two official data sources may provide additional information, 
helping the estimation of a country's 
food availability: industrial output surveys 
and Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys (HCES). 
See Section 2.2 for the description of HCES surveys).

In its online database (FAOSTAT), FAO provides free access to FBSs for 
over 245 countries and territories and all the FAO regional groups, from 
1961 to date (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home).  
The FBSs reported are "standardized FBSs": the 
quantity of primary commodities available for consumption (e.g., wheat) include 
the quantity of processed commodities (e.g., bread) converted back to their 
primary commodities. The list of food commodities (such as "cassava") in each of 
the 24 food groups (such as "starchy roots") can be found in the definition and 
standard section of the FAOSAT FBS website 
(https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS). Data on per capita 
food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity, and in terms of caloric 
value, referred to as the Dietary Energy Supply (DES). 
The protein and fat content are also calculated 
by applying appropriate food composition factors 
for all primary and processed products.

The per capita supply available for human consumption is obtained by dividing 
the food supply by the partaking population estimate in each country; it is 
expressed in grams per capita of individual food commodities. FAO uses mid-
year official population estimates released by the United Nations Development 
Program (UNDP). The most recent data are available at  
https://population.un.org/wpp/   According to the last 
FAO recommendation for FBS compilers, the number of migrants and tourists 
must be subtracted from the population estimates. The number of migrants and 
tourists should be calculated as the difference between country's outbound 
travelers and inbound visitors (FAO 2021a).  

The accuracy of food balance sheets, 
which are in essence derived statistics, is of 
course dependent on the reliability of the 
underlying basic statistics. The coverage 
and accuracy of underlying statistics vary a 
great deal between countries. In some 
low-income countries, the coverage and quality of the 
statistics are uncertain - especially for 
food diverted for non-human food uses and for food stocks.
Systematic errors may also 
increase in countries where food systems become 
more sophisticated. FBSs may result in an underestimate of 
per capita food supply 
in low-income countries where subsistence 
agriculture is widespread. In fact, 
household consumption of vegetal food products 
obtained through growing or 
gathering and of animal food products obtained 
through breeding or hunting are 
not considered in the calculation.  
FAO documents emphasize that availability for 
human consumption does not equate with consumption. The quantities of 
food available for human consumption, as estimated in the food balance sheet, 
reflect only the quantities reaching the consumer at retail level. 
The amount of food (and of nutrients) 
actually consumed may be lower than the quantity shown 
in the food balance sheet depending on the degree of loss and waste of edible food 
and nutrients in the household, e.g., during storage, in preparation and cooking 
(which affect vitamins and minerals to a greater extent than calories, protein and 
fat) as plate-waste, as fed to domestic animals and pets, or thrown away 
(https://www.fao.org/economic/the-statistics-division-
ess/methodology/methodology-systems/supply-utilization-accounts-and-food-
balance-sheets-background-information-for-your-better-understanding/en/).

When making use of FAO FBS data, one must recognize that recently 
FAO has changed its FBS methodology. The new methodology 
is illustrated in the document "The New Food Balances and the utilization 
variables" (FAO, 2021a). Key differences between new and old FBS are 
described in FAO (2021b). With the release of FBS data for 2019, the new 
methodology used for 2014-2019 has been applied backwards to cover 2010-2013, 
therefore giving consistent time series of national food supply from 2010 to 
2019. The per capita food supply data for 2010-19 have been compiled using the 
2019 UNPD population data, whereas the series up to 2009 has been compiled 
using the 2015 (or even earlier) version of the UNPD population data. FAO plan
that the FBS preceding 2010 will also be recompiled using the new methodology. 

2.2.  Measurement of food available for consumption at the household level: 
Household surveys

Household food consumption is defined as the total amount of 
food and beverages available for consumption in the household 
plus foods prepared and consumed by the household but outside.
Household surveys are of two types: 
(a) those developed in the 80s as an alternative 
to individual surveys to provide nutritional information.   
In these, Household Food Consumption Surveys (HFCS) food consumption is measured.  
(b) More recently, particularly in low- and middle-income economies, household 
surveys are being used to inform on global food security and poverty, and where
where food available for consumption is measured but forms only part of the survey
(Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys (HCES). 
Surch surveys can also be conducted in 
institutions, e.g. for institutionalized elderly.

In the past, some surveys similar to HFCS or HCES were 
conducted  in high-income countries with the objective of dietary assessment.
They were based on a record of food quantities entering the 
household, either purchased, received as gifts, or produced for household use, 
over a reference period. They used the "food account method" (Burk & Pao, 1976) or 
the "food inventory method" (Turrini et al., 2001). 
Individual food consumption by the 
household was often recorded as an additional component of the 
survey, leading to an increased burden on the sampled households. Such surveys 
are now rare and have been substituted by individual food consumption surveys.

During HFCS and HCES, data on acquisition and/or expenditure and/or 
consumption of commodities including foods and beverages are collected. HFCS 
and HCES are less expensive than individual food consumption surveys and 
require a lower burden for participants. However, many of the technical problems 
and limitations of household surveys are the same as those of individual dietary 
surveys and are discussed in other sections (Chapters 4 and 5). Thus, diet might 
be altered by the design of the survey or the recording process. 

Typically, HFCS and HCES are conducted on large nationally representative 
sample of households (Fiedler et al., 2012). These surveys all involve collecting 
information on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the household, 
thereby enabling data to be presented in terms of income 
level, family size, region of the country, etc. Attention must be paid to the 
sample design of these surveys 
to ensure that a representative national 
sample is obtained, as noted in  
Setion 1.4.2. The sample design should account for the influence on food 
consumption of season, holidays, weekends, socioeconomic status and region to 
obtain information on the true mean food consumption and the diverse food 
consumption pattern of a population.

2.2.1. Household Food Consumption Surveys (HFCS).

HFCS measure all food and beverages consumed within a household during a 
specified period. They require careful supervision by the interviewer and good 
cooperation of the respondents. In general, these surveys are more complicated 
and costly to undertake than HCES and are therefore often not carried out 
frequently or at regular intervals. They are now rarely performed; they have 
been substituted with individual food consumption 
surveys even if the latter are more costly. 

Weighed household food records

Food records (also called food diaries) are usually completed over at least a 1-wk 
period, by either the householder or a fieldworker. The food eaten by the 
household is recorded. During the survey period, the weight 
or volume of each food consumed at each meal is recorded, before subdivision 
into individual helpings (Burk & Pao, 1976). Detailed descriptions of all foods, 
including brand names, and their method of preparation are recorded. For 
composite dishes, the amount of each raw ingredient used in the recipe and the 
final weight of the prepared composite dish is also recorded. In some surveys the 
plate wastes from each meal are collected and separated so that individual food 
item wastes are weighed and recorded.  

Household 24-h recalls

In this method, the household member responsible for the food preparation is 
interviewed to obtain information on both household composition and household 
food consumption over the previous 24-h period. In the first stage of the 
interview, information is collected on the dishes and ingredients consumed, 
followed by details on the quantity, focusing particularly on those foods that are 
important sources of energy.  
A technical guide for measuring household food consumption using a 24-h recall 
was developed by Swindale & Ohri-Vachaspati (1999), providing detailed 
instructions and sample questionnaires that can be used to collect the data, 
quantify the portion sizes of food consumed, and analyze the results.

2.2.2. Household Consumption and Expenditure surveys (HCES).

Household Consumption and Expenditure surveys (HCES) are typically 
performed within Household Expenditure Surveys (HES), i.e. economic surveys 
designed to inform national economic policy which are usually implemented by 
national statistical agencies. 

HCES are less costly than HFCS and are widely used in low-income settings 
(FAO, 2023). They are usually conducted every 3-5 years. HCES refer to a 
heterogeneous group including Household Income Expenditure Surveys (HIES), 
Living Standards Measurement Studies (LSMS) and National Household Budget 
Surveys (NHBS). LSMS are multi-topic surveys for which technical assistance 
can be provided by the World Bank's LSMS group. 

HCES were primarily designed to measure household food available for 
consumption in a reference period through the expenditure approach (i.e., the 
monetary value of the food). Over time, quantities of foods and beverages have 
also been collected, and these surveys have been repurposed to serve other needs 
such as monitoring food security, leading to improvements in survey design and 
the capture food data of a higher quality.  

Food consumption estimates generated from acquisition data or a combination of 
both acquisition and consumption data are usually referred to as "apparent 
consumption" or "food available for consumption" to distinguish it from actual 
consumption (Fiedler & Mwangi, 2016). Data collected in HCES on food 
available for consumption are quite often used as a proxy for the quantities eaten.

HCES vary in their complexity and respondent burden. Data are collected through 
a diary or recall with reference period ranging usually from seven days to one 
month. Food and beverages, wasted, spoiled, or fed to pets or livestock are 
frequently not accounted for but, in some cases, wastes can be weighed, or a 
wastage factor can be applied. Food and beverages prepared and consumed 
outside of the house have always been poorly captured in most HCES but there is 
a trend to improve the collection of this consumption. In some recent HCES a 
special module has been added to collect personal expenditure on snacks, meals, 
sweets, and drinks consumed outside the home. Adjustments can also be made for 
the presence of non-household members during the survey period. Ideally HCES 
should report all the sources of consumption, either purchased, received as gifts, 
or produced for household use.

Some HCES collecting only food entering the households (based on concept of 
acquisition) assume that there are no major changes in household stocks during 
the survey period. An important limitation of this simplified methodology is 
related to the fact that some foods (e.g. grains) are not perishable and can be 
stored. As a consequence, if the survey is conducted in a period of drawing-down 
stocks to meet current consumption, household consumption is underestimated. 
On the contrary, if the survey is conducted in a period of stocks accumulation for 
later consumption, household consumption will be overestimated (Smith et al., 
2014). It is therefore recommended that these simplified HCES are no longer 
used. 

A study conducted in Tanzania in 2007 and 2008 with the use of eight different 
survey designs of HCES assessed the effect on over- and under-reporting of survey 
length, level of detail of food list and diary 
versus record methodology (Beegle et al., 2010). Over- and-under reporting 
appeared to depend on the specific setting in 
terms of share of consumption from home production, dietary diversity, and 
fraction of meals eaten in the household. 

The experiment by Beegle et al. (2010) was combined with extensive research on 
100 available HCES surveys to identify possible strategies towards improvement 
and harmonization of survey methodologies to collect more reliable food data for 
poverty or food security analysis (Carletto, Zezza & Banerjee, 2013, Smith et al., 
2014, Zezza et al, 2017). Based on this research FAO and WB (2018) developed 
guidelines for the collection of food data in HCES. Low- and middle-income 
countries are recommended to adopt these guidelines so that food data collected in 
HCES are of better quality and standardized between countries.

2.3. Main uses of national or household surveys 

2.3.1. Uses of FBS

In relation to other sources of data 
on food supply, FBSs data have the comparative 
advantage of being easily accessible and of providing a global coverage of 
countries food supplies with a rather consistent methodology. 

Access of FBS data makes it easy to assess its correlation with other data which 
have a global coverage.  For instance, associations between mortality at national 
level and per capita food supply assessed through FBSs have sometimes been 
studied. However, any interpretation in terms of causal/effect of such observed 
association is highly questionable and should be discouraged. 

On the contrary, FBS is an appropriate and extremely rich source of data for 
observational studies. Del Gobbo et al. (2015) have developed calibration models 
by matching FBSs per capita food supply data with estimated individual food 
intake by age and sex at the country level. The authors suggest that these models 
could be used not only to improve per capita food intakes estimates but even to 
assess individual food intakes by age and sex, based on countries FBSs. FBS are 
also quite frequently used to compare per capita food supply between countries 
and regions and to assess time trends since 1961 at country, regional and global 
level. They can also be used to formulate agricultural policies concerned with the 
production, distribution and consumption of foods. 
However one of the main uses of FBS is to 
monitor global hunger and to provide data on national 
diets or nutrient adequacy. FBSs data can provide insights into the countries and 
regions that are most likely to be at greatest risk for low intakes of some nutrients. 

Given the importance of the decisions that may be taken based on FBS data, 
users need to have a good understanding of the data sources. Jacobs & Sumner 
(2002) provide a thorough analysis of their appropriate uses and potential 
weaknesses. 

Trends in global hunger

Ideally, the assessment of food insecurity should be based on data from nationally 
representative individual or household surveys (see Section 2.2). However, 
only a few countries conduct such surveys on an annual basis. FBSs therefore 
have a key role in the assessment of global food insecurity, published yearly in 
the report "The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World" by FAO, 
IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO (2022). This global monitoring report identifies 
countries in which food insecurity is most prevalent, monitors food security 
trends over time and provides projections of future food insecurity. Thus, the per 
capita Dietary Energy Supply (DES) estimated from FBSs is used as proxy of the 
average energy intake of the population. The DES is combined with information 
on the inter-household variability in per capita "Dietary Energy Consumption" 
estimated from HCES and the minimum energy requirement at population level to 
estimate the Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) (Wanner, 2014). The use of 
data on inter-household variability in the PoU calculation is crucial. 
Food (and consequently energy) is, of course, not 
equally distributed among households within a 
country. A mere comparison between per capita DES with energy requirements at 
country level would largely underestimate the prevalence of food insecurity at 
household level in many countries. 
PoU is one of the indicators of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (FAO 2021e). 

Macronutrient availability at national level 

Nutrient supply per capita can be estimated by combining supply data from FBSs 
expressed in g/capita/day with a food composition database for all primary and 
processed items. Energy (kcal/capita/day), protein (g/capita/day), and fat 
(g/capita/day) supplies are freely available by year and country on FAO website 
(https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBSH).
 
It is noteworthy that FAO nutrient supply data are obtained through a common 
global food composition database, ignoring the differences in composition 
of foods between countries. The food composition database is available in 
FAO (2001a) but no reference is provided in terms of data source.

Due to uncertainties in the data and process used to develop FBSs, macronutrients 
are often expressed as percentage of energy (e.g. percentage of calories from 
proteins) or as ratios between nutrients (e.g. ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to 
saturated fatty acids) (Sasaki & Kesteloot, 1992) rather than through per capita 
nutrient supply.

The use of nutrient density allows the comparison of diet quality between 
countries which have differing levels of accuracy of the food supply data and thus 
differing level of under/over estimation of total nutrient per capita supply. 
However, the assessment of the percentage of energy, protein fat and nutrients 
derived from each food group and the comparison of such data by countries can 
be jeopardized by a differing level of under/over estimation between food groups.

Food security indicators at national level

Five indicators present in the FAO "Suite of indicators of food security" are 
derived from 3-year moving averages of FBS
(https://data.apps.fao.org/catalog/dataset/faostat-food-security/resource/a9a2c6ac-
4c3b-4604-bb81-35a3a782763e)

*	Share of dietary energy supply derived from cereals, roots and tubers 
(percent, 3-year average)
*	Dietary energy supply used in the estimation of the Prevalence of 
Undernourishment (kcal/cap/day, 3-year average)
*	Average dietary energy supply adequacy (percent, 3-year average)
*	Average protein supply (g/cap/day, 3-year average)
*	Average supply of protein of animal origin (g/cap/day, 3-year average)

Among these, a key nutritional indicator is the share of 
energy from cereals, roots 
and tubers. This percentage is typically 
high in low-income countries where these 
staple foods constitute a very large part of the diet with a 
resulting in low diversity and low micronutrient supply. 
The average supply of protein of animal 
origin is an indicator of diets with low supply of high-quality proteins.

Micronutrient availability at national level 

Several efforts have been made to use FBS for the assessment of the adequacy of 
nutrient supply at global level, in different regions of the world and 
individual countries. To this aim FBSs have been matched not only to energy and 
macronutrients, but also to full range of vitamins and minerals.

FBSs provide national data and thus do not provide any information on the per 
capita nutrient supply by age and sex, although 
the different age and sex groups have 
very different micronutrient needs. However, the age and sex distributions of each 
country allow calculation at the national level of 
the theoretical estimated 
average requirement (EAR) for each micronutrient. The percentage of the 
population at risk of inadequacy may be estimated as the proportion of the 
population with usual intakes under the theoretical mean requirement of the 
population. The distribution of usual intake in the population is inferred 
from the mean usual intake per capita of the nutrient supply and the estimated 
within person variability for each nutrient.  This method, called EAR cut-point 
method, is described in detail in chapter 8.b. of the present volume. 

Wuehler, Peerson & Brown (2005) performed this analysis in 176 countries based 
on the estimated phytate supply and considering its bioavailability (based on the 
estimated phytate-to-zinc molar ratios). The estimated zinc supply was estimated 
based on FBSs combined with a common global food composition database for 
all countries. 

Arsenault, Hijmans & Brown (2015) used FBSs from three countries 
(Bangladesh, Senegal, and Cameroon) and assessed the per capita availability for 
eight micronutrients (vitamin A, vitamin C, 
vitamin B6, riboflavin, niacin, folate, 
calcium and zinc). A common food composition database was compiled and used 
for all three countries, but additional country-specific adjustments were made to 
take into consideration the different processing of staple foods.
This leads to differing nutrient 
composition of ingested foods (e.g. percentage of refined wheat at country 
level). 

Two indicators of adequacy were used: 
1) the per capita nutrient supply 
expressed as a percentage of the theoretical weighed EAR of each country and 
2) the percentage of the population that has an adequate usual intake, as 
estimated with the EAR cut-point method (see chapter 8.b). 
Each nutrient gap in the food 
supply was calculated as the difference between the current amount in the food 
supply minus the amount of the nutrient needed to achieve 80% prevalence of 
adequate intakes. Linear optimization modeling was used to determine the 
optimal mix of crops to fulfill the nutrient gaps for several nutrients. 

Smith et al. (2016) performed a very comprehensive estimate of per capita supply 
for 23 macro- and micronutrients in 225 food groups in 152 countries over 50 
years (1961 to 2011) by combining FBSs data with some ancillary data. Food 
supply by age and sex was assessed considering the percentage of edible food and 
the level of fortification in each food group together 
with data from individual and 
household surveys at country level. In each country an ad-hoc food composition 
database was compiled based on six national and regional food composition 
tables. Nutrient losses during the processing of cereals to flour were considered. 
The distribution of nutrient per capita supply by age and sex was derived through 
a probabilistic method (Monte Carlo simulations).  

2.2.3. Uses of data from household surveys

Data on household food availability for consumption derived from household 
surveys and HCES in particular are largely used for the assessment of global and 
national trends in food security in low- and middle-income countries and to provide information on food consumption patterns. 
The World Bank has developed the most 
comprehensive repository of HCES data worldwide. 
(https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/home).

Data sources and details of the relevant 
methods used to produce diet-related food security 
indicators from household consumption surveys are summarized on the Data4Diet 
platform developed by the INDDEX project (2018). 

HCES with carefully designed consumption modules are a valuable source of data 
for household-level food security and nutrition measurement (Russell et al., 2018; 
Zezza et al., 2017). However, the consumption modules used 
are heterogeneous across 
countries. Main differences among HCES are 
1) the length of the recall period; 
2) whether data are collected at acquisition or consumption level, or both; 
3) whether there is information on the 
mode of food acquisition (purchases, own production, 
and in-kind); 
4) whether or not information on food consumed away from home is 
collected and in what form; 
5) whether food detail is collected through open recall 
or a list, and, if a list, how 
disaggregated and specific the foods and food groups 
are; and 
6) the use of non-standard units without available conversions (Smith et 
al., 2014). 

Therefore, comparisons across countries can be inaccurate and the 
indicators of food security and nutrition derived from some HCES survey 
may be very uncertain. For example, 
if the food consumption module has a short food 
list with aggregated items, the matching with a food composition database leads 
to large uncertainty in the assessment of the 
per capita supply of nutrients. If food 
consumed away from home is not considered, the assessment of food security and 
nutrition indicators is uncertain.

Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU)

Dietary energy is never equally distributed within a country. For this reason, as 
mentioned in Section 2.3.1, information on the variability in the distribution 
of household per capita dietary energy consumption is often 
used to estimate the PoU at the
national level. Such information is generated from household surveys. Updated 
instructions related to the estimation of PoU using HCES data can be found in a 
FAO e-learning course available here: 
https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=386 (accessed January 2023).

Data on height by age and sex and of the percentage of pregnant and lactating 
females in each country are used to calculate the weighed average of normative 
per capita minimum energy requirement. The process is illustrated in the 
methodology section of the State of Food Insecurity (SOFI) annual report (FAO, 
IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO,2022). The calculation of energy requirement 
requires an estimate of the Physical Activity Level (PAL) by age/sex groups. 
When such data are not available, a normative PAL of 1.55 is generally used. 

The PoU calculation takes into account 
the level of inequality in accessing dietary 
energy between households (by correcting excess variability in food data 
collected in HCES due to measurement errors) and the expected component of 
variability due to differences in individuals' body weight and physical activity 
levels. 

Food security indicators and per capita nutrient availability  

Estimates of per capita food, nutrient and energy intake available for consumption 
can be calculated by multiplying the edible portion of foods with food 
composition tables. The number of household members and visitors eating each 
meal can be recorded to estimate the per capita availability. Socioeconomic 
characteristics of the household allow to estimate per capita food available for 
consumption at regional and/or national level by category of socio-economic 
groups, education, household size, etc. 

Moltedo et al. (2014) developed detailed instructions for analyzing food security 
using household survey data. FAO and the World Bank have developed a free 
standalone software (ADePT-FSM (Food Security Module)) that allows users to 
easily derive food security indicators from HCES data. 
(https://www.fao.org/food-agriculture-statistics/statistical-domains/food-security-
and-nutrition/methodology/en/).
Moltedo et al. (2018) developed detailed instructions for estimating per capita 
availability for consumption of micronutrients and amino acids using food data 
collected in HCES. 

With regards to nutrient adequacy based on HCES it is stressed that only 
appropriately measured intakes at individual levels should be compared with sex- 
and age-specific nutrient recommendations to estimate the nutrient adequacy in 
the different age and sex population groups (Section 8.1.1). However, it is still 
possible to estimate ratios of per capita availability of nutrients to the average 
weighed nutrient requirement at population level. These ratios do not allow to 
estimate the prevalence of inadequacy in the population but may provide a gross 
indication of issues in 
covering requirements some specific nutrients at population 
level. (Moltedo et al. 2018)

Preliminary attempts to estimate the prevalence of nutrient inadequacy (PoNI) 
based on household data have been performed. To this aim, a pre-treatment of 
data is needed to remove within-person variation, i.e. to adjust for  
day-to-day variability. Moltedo et al. (2022) compared the prevalence of 
inadequacy estimated with pre-treated household survey data versus individual 
food consumption survey. The analysis was performed for eight micronutrients 
(vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12 and C, and calcium and zinc) with the use of 
Bangladesh datasets. 

Reconciliation between FBSs and HCESs

Gr�nberger K. (2014) compared per capita food supply from country-specific 
FBSs with that of 64 HCESs from 51 low- and middle-income countries, for 16 
major food groups. Overall, the results of the reconciliation suggest that average 
consumption of cereals, eggs, fish products, 
pulses and vegetables are likely to be 
underestimated in FBS, whereas fruits, meat, milk and sugar products are likely to 
be overestimated. Both FBS and HCES are prone to measurement errors. 
Even though the estimated differences in average total food supply per capita 
were moderate, there is considerable 
uncertainty in the estimate of availability of 
single food groups at country and global level. 

2.3.3. National and household surveys in the global assessment of food security 
and diet quality by age and sex 

As mentioned in chapters 3 and 4, individual food consumption data are key to 
assess the distribution of usual food and nutrient intake in different population 
groups within a country and thus to 
evaluate the adequacy of the diet (chapter 8b). 
A publicly available global database such as the FAO/WHO GIFT platform 
(https://www.fao.org/gift-individual-food-consumption/en/) includes only data 
collected through quantitative individual food consumption survey.

Other global databases make use of FBS and HCES data to model the intake of 
foods and nutrients by age and sex worldwide, by filling the gaps in individual 
food consumption data. It is the case of the Global Dietary Database initiative 
(GDD) and of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) database.  
The GDD database is available at https://www.globaldietarydatabase.org/ 
and provides modeled data for 55 dietary factors 
including 14 foods, 7 beverages, 15 macronutrients and 19 micronutrients in 
185 countries. Modeled data are provided by country, year of primary data 
collection, age, sex, education level, urban or rural residence, and 
pregnancy/nursing status. 
The IHME initiative database is available at  
http://www.healthdata.org/results/data-visualizations (accessed November 
2022).  Modeled data are provided by country, age, sex and year of primary 
data collection in 204 countries for 87 indicators, including 15 dietary 
indicators (9 foods and 6 nutrients). These dietary indicators are included in 
the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), a worldwide observational 
epidemiological study. Key research papers based on the analysis of GBD data 
are published each year in a special issue of The Lancet 
(https://www.thelancet.com/gbd/about). 

Conclusion

In conclusion, the assessment of food available for consumption through 
household and national surveys provides key information for the global 
monitoring of food security. They are less expensive than individual food 
consumption surveys and can therefore be performed more frequently. 
Conversely, they are not fit to assess individual food consumption and, 
consequently, to assess nutrient adequacy of the diet. 
National, household and individual surveys are thus complementary. Efforts to 
take full advantage of this complementarity should be encouraged so that better 
data are available to monitor the adequacy of diets. Indeed, better data on what 
people eat is a key requirement for better policies.
