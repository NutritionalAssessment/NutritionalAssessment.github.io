<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

Body proteins are made up of 20 amino acids, of which nine are termed
indis&shy;pens&shy;able because they cannot be synthesized in the body and must be
supplied preformed from the diet.  Proteins and amino acids in the body
have multiple and varied functions ranging from the support of growth
and repair of body tissue to the support of immune cell functions.
Ingested proteins are degraded during digestion into free amino acids
and peptides prior to absorption through the intestinal mucosa, followed
by transport in the portal blood to various tissues and cells.  About
one third of the amino acids entering the liver are used for protein
synthesis, energy metabolism, and gluconeogenesis.  No body store of
protein exists so with short-term inadequate intakes, protein is first
lost from the visceral protein pool, but with prolonged deficiency, from 
skeletal muscle, leading to the marasmic form of protein-energy
malnutrition. ln general, high protein intakes are not harmful except
under certain conditions or disease states, and as yet, no Tolerable
Upper Intake Levels for protein have been set.
<p></p>
Protein requirements are currently based on nitrogen balance and
defined as the minimum amount of nitrogen required to achieve zero
balance for healthy adults.  For children, pregnant and lactating women,
the additional amounts of nitrogen required for deposition of newly
formed tissues and secretions are esti&shy;mated by the factorial approach.
An alternative approach for estimating protein requirements has been developed, 
called the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method. 
This method is not based on nitrogen balance and yields 
protein requirements which are approximately 40% higher than
current recom&shy;men&shy;dations.  
<p></p>
Indispensable adult amino acid
requirements are currently based on this IAAO method plus an
adaption. The 24-hour indicator amino acid balance (IAAB) yields
estimates that are 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;times higher than nitrogen balance data
estimates.
<p></p>
Sources of protein in the diet vary in their amino acid composition.
Some plant-based proteins are lacking in indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids
whereas most animal-source foods are considered high quality protein
because they have an optimal indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acid composition
relative to their requirements and
high digestibility and bioavailability.  The current recommended measure
of protein quality is the Digestibility Indispensable Amino Acid Score
(DIAAS) which relies on measures of true ileal digestibility.  Future
evaluations of the adequacy of protein intakes should correct for
protein quality based on DIAAS.

<h3>  16a.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

Total body protein accounts for about 14&#8209;16% of body mass; approx&shy;imately 11kg of
protein in a 70kg reference male and approx&shy;imately 9kg of protein in a 60kg
reference female

which is widely distributed throughout
the different tissues of the body.  Most body protein is present in the
skeletal muscle (approx&shy;imately 43%)

Structural tissues (i.e., skin and
blood) each contain approx&shy;imately 15% of the total protein while the
meta&shy;bolically active visceral tissues (e.g., liver and kidney) contain
about 10% of the total protein.  The remainder is in the brain, heart, lung, 
and bone.  Approximately 50% of the
total protein content of the body is characterized by four proteins,
myosin and actin in skeletal muscle, collagen, and hemoglobin.  The
skeletal muscle protein (termed somatic protein) and the visceral
protein pool together comprise the meta&shy;bolically available protein known
as the "body cell mass".
<p></p>

The distribution of protein among the organs such as the brain, lung,
heart, and bone varies with
developmental age, with the neonate having proportionately less muscle
and much more brain
and visceral tissue than an adult.

<h3> 16a.1.1 Functions of protein and amino acids </h3>

Protein is important in the diet as a source of amino acids,
particularly those amino acids which are indis&shy;pens&shy;able and hence must be
derived from the diet.  There are 20 amino acids
required for protein synthesis

The remainder are
either dispensable, because they can be formed in the body from carbon
and nitrogen precursors, or conditionally indis&shy;pens&shy;able.  The term
conditionally indis&shy;pens&shy;able recognizes that under certain physiological
circumstances (e.g., neonates) the ability to synthesize some of these
amino acids endoge&shy;nously relative to the demand becomes limited.
<p></p>
Proteins synthesied from the 20 amino acids are the basic functional
units of the cell and carry out multiple functions essential for life.
Recently, increasingly complex roles for protein and amino acids have
been discovered, including roles in the regulation of body composition,
main&shy;tenance of organ / tissues such as bone, gastro&shy;intestinal function,
bacterial flora, glucose homeostasis, cell signaling, and satiety.
Box 16a.1 provides some examples of selected functions of proteins and
amino acids.

<ul>
<li>
Growth, maintenance, and movement: Proteins form
integral parts of most body structures such as skin,
tendons, membranes, muscles, organs, and bones.
As such, they support the growth and repair of body tissues
and protect the body (skin, immuno&shy;globulins, etc).
<li>
Enzymes: Proteins function as enzymes and modulate various
bio&shy;chem&shy;ical reactions for energy production
and body mass formation.
<li>
Hormones: Some, but not all hormones, are proteins
or derived from an amino acid; hormones function as
messengers and signals and regulate body processes
(e.g.,insulin, growth hormone, oxytocin).
<li>
Immune function/communication: The structure of antibodies,
cyto&shy;kines, chemo&shy;kines, and regulators of
gene trans&shy;cription and trans&shy;lation through mTOR
signaling pathway are proteins.
<li>
Fluid and electrolyte balance: Proteins in extracellular
fluid help to maintain the fluid volume and the
composition of body fluids (e.g., albumin).
<li>
Acid-base balance: Proteins help maintain the acid-base
balance of body fluids by acting as buffers because
of their charged amino acids.
<li>
Transportation and storage: Proteins transport substances,
such as lipids, vitamins, minerals, and oxygen,
throughout the body and storage of micronutrients (e.g., ferritin).

In addition to the synthesis of body protein, amino acids
are also required for the synthesis of
other important nitrogen-containing com&shy;pounds.
The latter include creatine, nucleo&shy;tides and
nucleic acids, poly&shy;peptide hormones (e.g., insulin, thyroid
hormones, growth hormone, and
glucagon), and some neuro&shy;trans&shy;mitters and other
non-poly&shy;peptide hormones. Functions of
some of the individual amino acids are shown in Box 16a.2;

Amino acids consumed in excess of the amounts needed for the
formation of nitrogenous com&shy;pounds are not stored but are degraded; the
nitrogen is excreted in the urine as urea, and the keto acids, left after
removal of the amino groups, are either used directly as sources of
energy or are converted to carbo&shy;hydrate or fat.  Nitrogen is also lost
in feces, sweat, and other body secretions and in sloughed skin, hair,
and nails.  Therefore, a continuous supply of amino acids must be
obtained from the diet to replace these losses, even in adulthood after growth has
ceased.
<p></p>
<h3> 16a.1.2  Absorption and metabolism of protein and amino acids
</h3>
<p></p>
In the body amino acids exist freely or as part of protein

They are made available through dietary protein intake or de&nbsp;novo 
synthesis.  The protein in the diet is denatured by stomach acid
and hydrolyzed in the gastro&shy;intestinal tract by a series of proteolytic
enzymes.  The end products of protein digestion &mdash; free amino acids and
small peptides &mdash; are taken up by mucosal cells of the small intestine by
an energy-requiring process involving several carrier systems.  Trace
amounts of whole proteins are also absorbed through the intestinal
mucosa and can enter the blood stream.
<p></p>
Upon entering the portal blood, the free amino acids are taken
up by the liver and other organs and metabolized along three possible
pathways.  These are:  (a) incor&shy;pora&shy;tion into tissue proteins, (b)
catabolism by degra&shy;dation pathways that involve deamination or
trans&shy;amination and, (c) synthesis of new nitrogen-containing com&shy;pounds
such as purine bases, creatine, and epinephrine, as well as dispensable
amino acids.  About one third of the amino acids entering the liver from
the portal blood are used for protein synthesis, energy metabolism, or
gluconeogenesis.  Skeletal muscle is the main site of metabolism of the
branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine).  For
further details see Crim and Munro

<p></p>
The amount of protein synthesized daily depends on the
require&shy;ments for growth, the manu&shy;facture of digestive and other enzymes,
and the repair of body tissues.  Even in healthy adults, proteins and
other nitrogenous com&shy;pounds are being continuously degraded and
resyn&shy;the&shy;sized in the body.  This process is termed "protein turnover"
and varies with age, physiological status, and level of protein intake.
<p></p>
In healthy adults, the rate of protein synthesis is balanced by
an equal amount of protein degra&shy;dation, so that the amount of body
protein remains approx&shy;imately constant over long periods of time.
During growth, however, protein synthesis exceeds protein degra&shy;dation so
there is a net deposition of protein leading to an expansion of the body
cell mass.  When protein intake is inad&shy;equate or diets are limiting in
certain indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids, then there is a shift in this balance
so that rates of synthesis of some body proteins decrease while protein
degra&shy;dation continues in an effort to provide an endoge&shy;nous source of
those amino acids most in need.  Conversely, when amino acids are
consumed in excess of the amounts actually needed, the excess are not
stored but are degraded, as noted earlier.
<p></p>
<h3> 16a.1.3 Effects of protein deficiency </h3>
<p></p>
There is no long-term storage of proteins in humans

	target="right" >Holt et al., 1962 </a>), </span>
and there&shy;fore loss of body protein results in the loss of
essential structural elements as well as impaired function.  Initially,
during short-term changes in dietary intakes, the main loss of protein
occurs from the visceral protein pool

In chronic deficiency states, however, the largest single contributor to
protein loss is the skeletal muscle

Loss of muscle mass (and adipose tissue) characterizes the
marasmic form of protein-energy malnu&shy;trition (PEM).  This is the form most
frequently encountered in low-income countries, where it is known as
nutritional marasmus.  It generally results from a prolonged reduction
of food intake.  Marasmus may also occur in more affluent countries in
hospital patients with chronic illnesses such as cancer, or from the
prolonged use of clear fluid diets and hypo&shy;caloric intra&shy;venous infusions
of 5% dextrose

Kwashiorkor, a second form of PEM,
occurs in children from certain regions of low-income countries.  In
these countries, kwash&shy;iorkor is often precipitated by a series of
environ&shy;mental insults in concert with a diet with a low protein content
relative to energy

Unlike marasmus, kwash&shy;iorkor does not result in clinical signs
of wasting, but instead with a range of clinical signs, including
bilateral pitting, edema, loss of hair pigmen&shy;tation, and skin lesions.
Metabolic disturbances are also more severe in kwash&shy;iorkor than
marasmus, some of which are poorly under&shy;stood, but include
hypo&shy;albumin&shy;emia, hepatic steatosis, and depletion of minerals, vitamins,
and antioxidants.  Of the latter, a reduced rate of synthesis of red
blood cell glutathione, the most abundant antioxidant in the body, has
been reported in children with edematous PEM relative to those with non-edematous PEM

cysteine in children with edematous PEM.  Differences in gut micro&shy;biota

Kwashiorkor may also occur in adult hospital patients in more

<h3> 16a.1.4 Effects of high protein intakes </h3>
<p></p>
There is no formal definition of a high-protein diet, although
most of the definitions range between 1.2 to 2.0g/kg/d

Within this range, a protein intake
&gt;1.5g/kg/d can be considered a high-protein diet.  According to data
from the U.S National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES),
the average intake of protein in an American diet is 1.2 to 1.4g/kg/d

Overall, the evidence suggests no adverse effects
of higher protein intake on bone health.  Instead, protein has been
shown to be positive for bone health.  Moreover, mounting evidence
demonstrates that older adults require more dietary protein to support
good health, recovery from illness, and maintain functionality

Despite the lack of evidence suggesting harmful effects of
higher protein intakes in healthy populations, under certain

(see Section 16a.3).  For children, pregnant and lactating women, a factorial approach
is used whereby the main&shy;tenance needs, based on nitrogen balance, are
summed with the addit&shy;ional protein needs associated with the deposition
of tissues or secretion of milk.  The only other method that has been
used to assess protein require&shy;ment is the indicator amino acid oxidation
(IAAO) method.  All three methods and their limitations are discussed
briefly below.
<p></p>
<h3> 16a.2.1 Nitrogen balance</h3>

The nitrogen balance method is the classical approach for
determining protein requirements.  It is based on several
assumptions.  These include the assumption that nearly all
of the body nitrogen is incorporated into protein so that
gain or loss of nitrogen from the body can be regarded as
synonymous with gain or loss of protein.  Secondly, in
healthy adults in energy balance, body nitrogen is constant
if the dietary intake of the test protein is adequate, and
thirdly if the body nitrogen content decreases or does not
increase adequately, then the dietary protein is deficient.
The validity of these assumptions is discussed in the FAO /WHO / UNU report

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2007). Protein and amino acid 
requirements in human nutrition. WHO. Geneva. ">
	(<a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf"
	target="right" >FAO, 2007</a>). </span>

<p></p>
The method for nitrogen balance involves the measure&shy;ment of
nitrogen intake (from the diet) minus the sum of nitrogen
output in urine, plus nitrogen losses in feces, skin, hair
and other miscellaneous losses.  However, the majority of
nitrogen balance studies only report measure&shy;ments of urinary
and fecal losses and not the measure&shy;ments for dermal or
miscellaneous nitrogen losses.  As a result, adjustments
are made to take such losses into account when
determining the protein requirements.  The intake of
nitrogen is quantified by analyzing the nitrogen
content of duplicate portions of food and careful collection
of all food not consumed, such as spillage and residue on
plates. In some cases, nitrogen intake is estimated from the protein intake
because most proteins are assumed to contain approximately
16% nitrogen.
<p></p>
To assess protein requirements using nitrogen balance,
different levels of a high-quality protein above and below
the expected requirement are tested on healthy adults who
are in energy balance.  For each level of test protein,
multiple days (i.e., 6-10 days) are needed for each
participant to adapt to reach a new steady state of nitrogen
excretion  

<span data-tippy-content="Danielsen M, Jackson AA. Limits of adaptation to a diet 
low in protein in normal man: urea kinetics. Clin Sci (Lond). 1992 Jul;83(1):103-8. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1325313/"
	target="right" >Danielsen & Jackson, 1992</a>). </span>

Therefore, nitrogen
balance studies are usually conducted on only a few test
protein intakes.  After the metabolic adaption period, it is
assumed that the requirement is met when the individual
comes into "zero nitrogen balance" i.e., when nitrogen
intake equals nitrogen excretion.  When nitrogen intake is
inadequate, more nitrogen is excreted than is consumed, due
to net losses of body protein, and the individual is said to
be in negative nitrogen balance.  Conversely, when the
nitrogen intake exceeds nitrogen losses, an individual is in
positive balance.
<p></p>
The expression for nitrogen balance is:
<p></p>
N balance = I &minus; (U &minus; Ue) &plus; (F &minus; Fe) &plus; S
<p></p>
where I = intake of nitrogen (protein / 6.25), U = total urinary nitrogen,
Ue = endoge&shy;nous urinary nitrogen, F = nitrogen voided in feces (as
unabsorbed protein), Fe = endoge&shy;nous fecal nitrogen losses, and S =
dermal nitrogen losses.
<p></p>
In most of the nitrogen balance studies on which the protein
requirements have been based, only the nitrogen contents of
the diet (I), urine(U) and feces (F) have been measured
directly.  For the endogenous urine and fecal nitrogen
losses and dermal nitrogen losses, the estimated allowances
are based on data from a limited number of studies, as noted earlier.
<p></p>
Nitrogen balance studies are very challenging, with
difficulties in quantifying all routes of both intake and
loss of nitrogen.  In practice, intake is often
over-estimated due to unconsumed food (crumbs, plate residue
etc) and output under-estimated due to inaccurate collection
techniques.  As a consequence, nitrogen balance results tend
to be biased toward a positive balance which leads to the
under-estimation of nitrogen/protein requirements

<p></p>
Nitrogen balance is also used to guide protein intake in
critically ill patients in whom excessive protein catabolism
(e.g., from trauma, sepsis, infection, and burns) can result
in high negative nitrogen balance values.  Results of a
recent systematic review and meta-analysis analysis suggest
that improved nitrogen balance is associated with a better
prognosis in critically ill patients

	target="right" >Zhu et al., 2022</a>). </span>

<p></p>
Other factors that may precipitate a negative nitrogen
balance include excessive loss of nitrogen arising from
fistulas or excessive diarrhea, inadequate intakes of
protein or energy, and an imbalance in the dispensable :
indispensable amino acid ratio.
<p></p>
In the past, total urinary nitrogen levels were rarely
measured in routine hospital laboratories, so urinary urea
nitrogen was determined and used to replace the estimation
of total urinary nitrogen in some circumstances.  To account
for the nonurea nitrogen components of the urine not
measured (e.g., ammonia, uric acid, and creatinine), a
correction factor of 2g of nitrogen per day was commonly
applied.  This factor was derived from studies examining the
relationship between measured total urinary nitrogen and
measured urinary urea nitrogen in a variety of nutritional
and clinical conditions

Nitrogen intake was determined accurately by analyzing the nitrogen
content of the diets or parenteral/enteral formulas using
the micro-Kjeldahl technique.  Alternatively, specific
conversion factors were used to calculate the nitrogen
content of parenteral solutions containing free amino acids,
and for mixed diets, 16% of the protein intake was assumed
to be protein.
<p></p>
However, many factors can affect the validity of adjusted
urinary urea nitrogen as a measure of nitrogen balance in
clinical patients

as noted earlier. In this approach the additional nitrogen (as protein) needed for the 
deposition of newly formed tissues or secretion of 
breast milk is added to the requirement for maintenance for an adult.
As the main&shy;tenance need is based on nitrogen balance, the factorial approach
is subject to the
limitations described above in Section 16a.2.1.  Moreover, whether the
calculated additional amounts of nitrogen required for depositing newly
formed tissues and secretions for children, pregnant and lactating
women, are correct is unclear, especially in view of the debate

acids in the body so excess amino acids must be partitioned between
incor&shy;pora&shy;tion into protein and oxidation (Elango, et al, 

<span data-tippy-content="Elango R, Ball RO, Pencharz PB. Recent advances in determining 
protein and amino acid requirements in humans. Br J Nutr. 2012 Aug;108 Suppl 2:S22-30. ">

protein stores and its implications in diet. JAMA. 1962 Aug 25;181:699-705.">
	<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13908575/"
	target="right" > 1962) </a>. </span>
This principle was validated in an
animal study by Ball & Bayley 

<span data-tippy-content="Ball RO, Bayley HS. Influence of dietary protein concentration on 
the oxidation of phenylalanine by the young pig. Br J Nutr. 1986 May;55(3):651-8. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3676182/"
	target="right" >1986</a>). </span>
<p></p>
When protein or a single indis&shy;pensable amino acid is provided
below its require&shy;ment in the diet, all others (including the indicator
amino acid), are in relative excess and will be oxidized as shown in
Figure 16a.1 
<span data-tippy-content="Ball RO, Bayley HS. Influence of dietary protein concentration on 
the oxidation of phenylalanine by the young pig. Br J Nutr. 1986 May;55(3):651-8. ">

	target="right" >Ball & Bayley, 1986</a>). </span>
As the intake of protein increases
(from deficient to excess) there is a decline in indicator oxidation,
reflecting whole-body protein synthesis.  Oxidation of the indicator
amino acid is highest when the dietary intake is 
below the protein pr amino acid require&shy;ment.  Once the
require&shy;ment is met for the limiting amino acid / protein, there is no
further change in oxidation of the indicator amino acid, and the point
of inflection, where oxidation stops declining and plateaus, is denoted
as the breakpoint (Figure 16a.1).  The breakpoint is determined using 
two-phase linear regression and indicates the 
requirement (equivalent to the Estimated Average Requirement or EAR) of 
the limiting (test) amino acid or protein

They include (a) whether the indicator amino acid
(i.e., phenyl&shy;alanine) becomes limiting and impacts the esti&shy;mated protein
require&shy;ment; (b) the protein require&shy;ment is determined in the fed state
and does not capture the fasted state; and (c) the diet is provided as
continuous hourly formulas comprised of free crystal&shy;line amino acids and
not as whole protein foods in a 3&#8209;4 meal format comparable to that eaten

<h3> 16a.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nutrient Reference Values for protein</h3>
<p></p>
Nutrient reference values (NRVs) for protein have been set by
several expert groups, although inconsistencies exist on the terminology
and approaches applied and the recom&shy;men&shy;dations set.  In most cases, two
NRVs for protein have been set for life-stage groups from aged 6mos
to &gt;70y.  The Average Requirement (AR) (or equiv&shy;alent) is defined
as the median protein require&shy;ment for healthy indi&shy;vid&shy;uals of a
particular sex and life-stage group.  Hence, the AR (or equiv&shy;alent)
refers to the intake level that meets the protein require&shy;ment of half of
the healthy indi&shy;vid&shy;uals in that sex and life-stage group.
The AR is used to
evaluate the adequacy of protein intakes of population groups.  In
contrast, the second NRV, termed a Safe Individual Intake by FAO

is defined as the 97.5th percentile of the distribution of indi&shy;vid&shy;ual
require&shy;ments, nominally the average + 1.96SD.  Hence any indi&shy;vid&shy;ual with
a safe indi&shy;vid&shy;ual intake (or equivalent) will have a very low risk (i.e., &lt;2.5%) of
deficiency (intake less than require&shy;ment)

When based on per kg body weight basis, adult values for the AR and safe
indi&shy;vid&shy;ual intake for protein are the same for all three expert groups.
These are 0.66 g/kg BW/d for the AR (or equiv&shy;alent) and 0.83 g/kg BW/d
for the safe level of intake (or equiv&shy;alent) based on a protein
digestibility corrected amino acid score of 1.0.  Note that currently
these values remain the same for the elderly and for those consuming
only plant-based products due to insufficient available data for these
subgroups.
<p></p>
<h3> 16a.3.2  Protein NRVs for infants, children, and adolescents </h3>
<p></p>
All three agencies also applied the factorial model to derive
protein NRVs based on protein needs for main&shy;tenance plus growth for
infants from 6mos onwards and for children and adolescents up to 18y.
FAO applied the adult main&shy;tenance value (0.66g/kg/d), plus
growth costs from total body potassium (TBK) studies of protein gain
adjusted with an efficiency value of 58%.

Adequate Intake (AI) based on the average amount of human milk consumed
(0.78L/d) and an average protein content of human milk (11.7g/L) during
the first 6mos of lactation.  The resulting AI for protein is 9.1g/d

main&shy;tenance needs (0.66g/kg/d) esti&shy;mated from mid-trimester weight gain

healthy pregnant women gaining 13.8kg by the end of the third trimester

suggests that the protein NRVs
recommended by FAO, especially for children, are also too low based on data
using the IAAO method. Details of the IAAO method have been discussed 
earlier (Section 16.2.3);  details of its application for 
protein requirements are outlined below.
<p></p>
<h3> 16a.3.4  Protein NRVs based on the IAAO method </h3>
<p></p>
The IAAO method (Section 16a.2.3) was first applied to the study of
protein require&shy;ments in humans by determining the protein require&shy;ments
of the same young adult males who participated in the original nitrogen
balance study

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17921376/"
	target="right" >Humayun et al., 2007</a>). </span>

The IAAO response was measured
when feeding graded intakes of protein ranging from 0.1 to 1.8g/kg/d.
NRVs corresponding to the FAO AR and safe indi&shy;vid&shy;ual intake of
0.93 and 1.2g/kg/d respectively, were determined.  Subsequently,
the IAAO method has been used to determine protein require&shy;ments in other
life-stage and physiological groups (Table 16a.5)

<h3> 16a.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methods for assessing amino acid require&shy;ments</h3>
<p></p>
Several methods have been developed to improve the nitrogen balance method
to determine the require&shy;ment for an indi&shy;vid&shy;ual 
indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acid.
Of these, amino oxidation methods are described briefly below.
These methods are now used to determine the amino acid requirements 
in adults (>19y) by FAO / WHO / UNU 

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2007). Protein and amino acid 
requirements in human nutrition. WHO. Geneva. ">
	(<a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf"
	target="right" >2007</a>). </span>

<h3> 16a.4.1 Direct Amino Acid Oxidation (DAAO)</h3>

This method was the first to
demonstrate that amino acid require&shy;ments derived using the nitrogen
balance method were underesti&shy;mated by a factor of 2&nbsp;to&nbsp;3 

<span data-tippy-content="Zello GA, Wykes LJ, Ball RO, Pencharz PB. 
Recent advances in methods of assessing 
dietary amino acid requirements for adult humans. 
J Nutr. 1995 Dec;125(12):2907-15.">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7500168/"
	target="right" >Zello et al., 1995</a>). </span>

However, because the DAAO method can only be used to estimate the
require&shy;ments of those amino acids whose carboxyl carbon is released into
the bicar&shy;bonate pool and measurable in breath

<span data-tippy-content="Pencharz PB, Ball RO. Different approaches to 
define individual amino acid requirements. Annu Rev Nutr. 2003;23:101-16. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12626690/"
	target="right" >Pencharz & Ball, 2003</a>), </span>

other methods with broader application have been developed.

<h3> 16a.4.2   Indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) </h3> 

This method can also be
used to determine amino acids require&shy;ments (Section 16a.4.3), when instead
of feeding graded intakes of protein, graded intake levels of the test
amino acid are provided.  The protein source is a crystalline amino acid
mixture patterned after egg protein pattern and provided at 1.0g/kg/day
in adults.  Additionally, the indicator amino acid is a different
indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acid than the amino acid being tested, 
often <sup>13</sup>C&#8209;labeled L&#8209;phenylalanine or
<sup>13</sup>C&#8209;labeled L&#8209;leucine.
When determining amino acid require&shy;ments, the IAAO
study day (day&nbsp;3) diet is formulated to be isocaloric and
isonitrogenous.  The nitrogen content of the diets is adjusted according
to the level of amino acid intake level being studied.  For all dietary
indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acid require&shy;ments except the branched chain amino
acids, L&#8209;alanine is used to keep the diets isonitrogenous.  When
assessing branched chain amino acid require&shy;ments, L&#8209;serine is used to
balance nitrogen content.
<p></p>
As discussed in Section 16a.2.3, opponents argue that the IAAO
fed-state amino acid require&shy;ments do not capture 24h fasted and fed
cycles.  Additionally, concern about whether prior adaptation to the
test amino acid intake is required, led to the modification termed the
24h indicator amino acid balance (IAAB) method and described below.

<h3> 16a.4.3 24h indicator amino acid balance (IAAB)</h3> 
	
The IAAB method is an adaption of the IAAO method led by 
concerns that the IAAO fed-state
amino acid require&shy;ments do not capture 24h fasted and fed cycles,
and the need for prior adaptation to the test amino acid intake.  The
method includes a 6d adaptation period to the test amino acid intake,
followed by measure&shy;ment of an indicator amino acid oxidation over a
24h period (12h fasted and 12h fed) 

<span data-tippy-content="Elango R, Ball RO, Pencharz PB. Recent advances in determining 
protein and amino acid requirements in humans. Br J Nutr. 2012 Aug;108 Suppl 2:S22-30. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23107531/"
	target="right" >Elango et al., 2012</a>). </span>

The indicator amino acid used is usually <sup>13</sup>C&#8209;labeled L&#8209;leucine.  
Balance is calculated as the difference in leucine oxidation and leucine intake.
The <sup>13</sup>C&#8209;labeled L&#8209;leucine isotope is 
administered intra&shy;venously over 24h
and during this time blood and breath samples are collected to measure
isotopic enrichment in the plasma.  Thus, the IAAB protocol is more
invasive than the IAAO protocol, so a fewer number of amino acid levels
are assessed in each participant:  between 2&nbsp;to&nbsp;4 intakes.
<p></p>
As reviewed by Elango et al., 

<span data-tippy-content="Elango R, Ball RO, Pencharz PB. Recent advances in determining 
protein and amino acid requirements in humans. Br J Nutr. 2012 Aug;108 Suppl 2:S22-30. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23107531/"
	target="right" >2012</a>), </span>

no systematic difference in
amino acid require&shy;ment estimates have been found using the 24h IAAB or
8h fed state IAAO protocol.  Also, for a given amino acid require&shy;ment
determined by the 24h IAAB method, the require&shy;ments in the fed and
fasted state are the same

<h3> 16a.4.4  Protein NRVs for indispensable amino acids</h3>
	
Unlike the require&shy;ments for protein, amino acid require&shy;ments in
adults (&gt;19y), including older adults, have been set
by FAO / WHO / UNU using data from
studies conducted using both IAAO (Section 16a.4,2) and IAAB (Section
16a.4.3) methods; see FAO

for more details.  All IAAO and IAAB
studies were conducted under measured energy needs and the derived
protein require&shy;ments range from 10&#8209;18% of the energy from protein.
<p></p>
It is noteworthy that EFSA (2015) did not derive requirements for the 
indispensable amino acids . They argued that amino acids are not 
provided as individual nutrients but in the form of protein. 
They were also of the view that more data are needed to obtain 
precise values for the individual indispensable amino acids.  
The US Institute of Medicine has published recommendations for 
amino acids as part of the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)

<h3> 16a.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food sources, 
dietary intakes, and quality of dietary protein</h3>
<p></p>
In many affluent countries, foods of animal origin (e.g., meat,
fish, milk and dairy products) are the major source of protein in the
diets of adults, with the proportion from the meat and dairy group
varying with age and region.  Most animal-source foods are considered to
have high quality protein because their protein has both an optimal
indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acid composition and a high digestibility.  Some
plant-based foods such as legumes, nuts and seeds, and soy products are
also considered high-quality sources of plant proteins because they
provide a higher proportion of indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids than other
plant foods. However, certain anti-nutritional factors present in plant foods 
or formed during processing may reduce the protein digestibility.
<p></p>
In the US NHANES 2015&#8209;2018 survey, approx&shy;imately two-thirds of total protein
intake of adults was from animal sources, and one third from plant
sources.  Of the latter, the primary protein source was grains, mainly
as refined grains, whereas the intake of protein from high quality plant
protein sources was low

Protein intake (as percent energy) was lower in those following
plant-based diets compared to meat-eaters, although on average within
recommended levels, a trend consistent with that in the US NHANES
2015&#8209;2018 study

Nevertheless, nutrient inadequacies
existed across all the dietary patterns reviewed, including vegan,
vegetarian, and meat-based diets.  In general, however, replacing
protein from animal sources with plant foods does provide a better
intake of those dietary components associated with reducing chronic
disease risk (i.e., lower intake of cholesterol and saturated fat and
higher intake of dietary fiber)

<p></p>
Both quantity and quality impact the adequacy of dietary protein
intakes.  Protein quality of diets is mainly dependent on its
composition of indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids, and their digestibility and
bioavailability.  In Western
countries, the amino acid pattern of mixed diets meets the require&shy;ment
levels for most age groups.  Even vegetarian mixed diets are likely to
meet the require&shy;ment levels if they contain complementary mixtures of
plant proteins

19y did not meet

<p></p>
In low-income countries, unlike affluent
countries, plant-based foods
often supply more than 50% of the total protein.  Moreover,
there is often excessive reliance on a single low protein plant-based
staple which is a poor source of certain indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids.  For
example, cassava and maize are the main sources of dietary protein in
many parts of Africa, and poor sources of leucine and methionine, and
tryptophan and lysine, respectively.  Hence, some concerns have been
raised, especially among young children in low&#8209; and middle-income
countries, that poor protein quality may be a factor limiting their
growth

<span data-tippy-content="Ghosh S, Suri D, Uauy R. Assessment of protein adequacy 
in developing countries: quality matters. Br J Nutr. 2012 Aug;108 Suppl 2:S77-87.">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23107551/"
	target="right" >Ghosh et al., 2012</a>). </span>

<p></p>
The protein content of staple foods in low-income countries are
often expressed as the proportion of the energy in the food provided by
protein: i.e., the FAO / WHO / UNU protein : energy ratio  

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2007). Protein and amino acid 
requirements in human nutrition. WHO. Geneva. ">
	(<a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf"
	target="right" >FAO, 2007</a>). </span>

Using this approach, foods such
as cassava, plantains, sweet potatoes and taros are classified as
examples of poor sources of protein (in relation to their energy).
Indeed, cassava has the lowest protein : energy ratio of any staple crop,
common cassava cultivars having only 1% protein.  Potatoes, unrefined
maize, rice and sorghum are classified as "adequate" sources of protein,
and groundnuts, beans and peas, cow's milk (skimmed), soybean, and dried
fish as "good".

<h3>  16a.5.1  Factors affecting the quality of dietary protein</h3>

The quality of dietary protein is largely evaluated based on its
composition of indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids, and their digestibility and
bioavailability.  The latter affect how well the amino acids within the
protein are digested, absorbed, and utilized for protein synthesis.  All
three factors are discussed below. For  a detailed review of 
protein quality, see  Boye et al.

<span data-tippy-content="Boye J, Wijesinha-Bettoni R, Burlingame B. Protein 
quality evaluation twenty years after the introduction 
of the protein digestibility corrected 
amino acid score method. Br J Nutr. 2012 Aug;108 Suppl 2:S183-211.">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23107529/"
	target="right" >2012</a>). </span>

<p></p>
<b>Composition of amino acids</b> affects protein quality.  High
quality or animal proteins provide all nine indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids in
the correct proportions
for the synthesis of body protein and other non-protein substances.
Poorer quality proteins such as plant proteins are low in
one or more indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acid as noted earlier 

<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine. 2005. Dietary Reference 
Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, 
Protein, and Amino Acids. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. ">
	(<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10490/dietary-reference-intakes-for-energy-carbohydrate-fiber-fat-fatty-acids-cholesterol-protein-and-amino-acids"
	target="right" >IOM, 2005</a>). </span>

The indis&shy;pens&shy;able
amino acid that is present in the smallest quantity relative to the
require&shy;ments and thus limits the body's ability to fully utilize other
amino acids in a given food or diet, is termed the "first limiting amino
acid".
<p></p>
There is no official standardized method for amino acid
analysis.  The methods involve three steps:  hydrolysis to break down
protein into their constituent amino acids, followed by derivatization
to improve their detectability, and finally chromatography to separate
the derivatized amino acids.  This final step is performed using techniques
such as High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPCL) or Gas
Chromatography (GC).
<p></p>
<b>Digestibility</b> refers to the net absorption of an amino
acid following digestion

<span data-tippy-content="Dietary protein quality evaluation in human nutrition. 
Report of an FAQ Expert Consultation. FAO Food Nutr Pap. 2013;92:1-66. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26369006/"
	target="right" >FAO, 2013</a>). </span>

Assessment of digestibility is
challenging due to the presence of endoge&shy;nous nitrogen com&shy;pounds
(digestive enzymes, mucoproteins etc.) which are mixed with the ingested
food in the intestinal tract.  Digestibility can be measured as fecal or
ileal digestibility.  Both methods have limitations.
<p></p>
Fecal digestibility measures the amino acid absorbed across the
entire gastro&shy;intestinal tract (mouth to anus)

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2007). Protein and amino acid 
requirements in human nutrition. WHO. Geneva. ">
	(<a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf"
	target="right" >FAO, 2007</a>). </span>

A limitation
of this method is that a portion of the dietary protein that enters the
large intestine is degraded by microbial activity.  This leads to
disappearances and/or appearances of amino acids from the digestive
tract which have no nutritional contribution to the availability of the
amino acids for protein metabolism.  Hence, this results in an over&#8209; or
under-estimate of digestibility depending on the food consumed.
<p></p>
Ileal digestibility quantifies the absorption of amino acids
across the small intestine (mouth to terminal ileum).  It has been
adopted by FAO as more representative of the bioavailability of dietary
amino acids, overcoming some of the limitations of fecal digestibility

<span data-tippy-content="Dietary protein quality evaluation in human nutrition. 
Report of an FAQ Expert Consultation. FAO Food Nutr Pap. 2013;92:1-66. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26369006/"
	target="right" >FAO, 2013</a>). </span>

When measuring ileal digestibility, endoge&shy;nous amino acid
components must be accounted for to yield the true ileal digestibility
value.  This step requires insertion of a naso-intestinal tube in humans
and is highly invasive.  However, in vitro digestibility methods are being explored,
such as INFOGEST, that mimic oral, gastric, and intestinal phases of digestion

<p></p>
It is posible that dual stable-isotope tracer method can be used to
determine true ileal indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acid digestibility in humans
but requires validation. The method requires development
of an isotopically intrinsically labeled food, which is then fed to
subjects in small meals, after which the appearance of the labeled amino
acids in the plasma is measured

that are digested and absorbed in a form that is utilizable for synthesizing

Certain anti-nutritional factors present in
plant foods or formed during processing can also interfere with
bioavailability and digestibility. Examples of those naturally occurring
include: trypsin inhibitors and haemagglutinins found in legumes; tannins
in legumes and cereals; and phytates in cereals, legumes, and oilseeds.
Antinutritional factors formed during processing include:  Maillard
reaction products (MRP) from heating or alkaline treatment, oxidized
forms of sulfur amino acids, D&#8209;amino acids and lysino-alanine; for more

<h3>  16a.5.2  Methods to evaluate protein quality</h3>

<p></p>
<b>Protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS)</b>
is a method used to evaluate the quality of a protein based on both its
amino acid composition and its digestibility.  The method was
recommended by FAO / WHO in 1993 and WHO / FAO / UNU in 

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2007). Protein and amino acid 
requirements in human nutrition. WHO. Geneva. ">
	(<a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf"
	target="right" >2007</a>). </span>

It is based on comparison of the first limiting amino acid in the test
protein (i.e., the amino acid present in the lowest concentration in a food)
with the concentration of that amino acid in a reference scoring
pattern, typically the amino acid require&shy;ments of preschool-age children
(i.e., 1&#8209;2y) (considered the most demanding in terms of protein quality
of indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids)
<a href="#table16a.8">(Table&nbsp;16a.8).</a>
For school children and adolescents, the amino acid scoring pattern for 
3&#8209;10y range is recommended

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2007). Protein and amino acid 
requirements in human nutrition. WHO. Geneva. ">
	(<a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf"
	target="right" >WHO / FAO / UNU, 2007</a>). </span>

This comparison generates a limiting amino acid score for the test protein 
which is then multiplied
by digestibility.  For the PDCAAS method, nitrogen fecal digestibility
(i.e., digestibility over the whole intestine) is applied.
The calculation is shown below:
<p></p>


<p></p>

\[\small \mbox  {PDCAAS =} \frac{\mbox {mg of limiting amino acid in 1g test protein}}
{\mbox {mg of the same amino acid in 1g of the reference protein}}\]
\[\small \mbox  { &times; true fecal digestibility}\]


<p></p>
Note initially, the highest PDCAAS score any protein could achieve was 1.0.
This indicated that the protein provided all the indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino
acids in the amounts required by the body.  Any scores exceeding 1.00
were truncated to a maximum of 1.0, reflecting the view that amino acids
supplied above the require&shy;ments do not have additional physiological
value and will be catabolized.  Truncation was also said to simplify the
comparison of protein quality among different foods.  
<p></p>
Truncation, however, has been criticized and is no longer practiced in the
modified PDCAAS described below.  The choice of an indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acid
pattern for preschool children has also been of concern as it can
underestimate the protein quality of a food consumed by adults who
require protein for main&shy;tenance and not growth

score obtained.  
The most limiting digestible indispensable amino acid content (DIAA) 
defines the DIAAS value of a protein.

To calculate DIAAS of single protein source, data on the complete 
indispensable amino acid (IAA) composition of the protein, 
the crude protein content (CP), and the IAA standardized 
ileal digestibility (SID) are required.   
For a given IAA<sub>y</sub>, DIAA<sub>y</sub> ratio is calculated as follows:

\[\small \mbox  {DIAAy ratio =} \frac{\mbox {IAAy &times; SIDy}}
{\mbox {Reference pattern score IAAy}}\]

where IAAy is expressed as mg/g CP.    The lowest DIAA ratio leads 
to the DIAAS value of the protein.

\[\small \mbox  {DIASS = 100 &times; lowest DIAA ratio among IAAs}\]

Based on the 0.5 to 3-year-old reference pattern (see Table 16a.9),

classified pork meat, casein, egg, and potato 
proteins as excellent quliaty proteins with an average DIAAS above 100, 
whey and soy proteins as high-quality protein with an average DIAAS &ge;75, 
whereas gelatin, rapeseed, lupin, canola, corn, hemp, fava bean, oat, pea, 
and rice proteins were in the no quality claim category (DIAAS &lt;75).
<p></p>
Values for DIAAS can also be calculated for protein mixtures.
To accomplish this, average values of each single protein for IAAy and SIDy 
in the mixture must be obtained. See Herreman et al.

for details of the calculation. The maximum DIAAS calculated among 
all possible ratios represents the optimal protein mixture.  
Care must be taken to ensure, where possible, that the values for 
IAAy and SIDy selected have taken into account any processing 
and cooking conditions. A protein source or protein mixture with a DIAAS 
of&nbsp;100&nbsp;or above indicates that none of its 
indispensable amino acids is limiting and this 
source of protein has the potential to meet physiological requirements.

but at that
time there was a lack of human digestibility data available that
utilized DIAAS.  However, in a later joint FAO&#8209;IAEA meeting in 2022,
valid in vitro models of ileal amino acid digestibility were presented
and a database of ileal digestibility of proteins and indi&shy;vid&shy;ual amino
acids in foods created.  Collection of data on the effects of processing
and storage on protein quality was also emphasized.  Access to such a
database in the future will facilitate calculation of the protein
quality of indi&shy;vid&shy;ual foods and mixtures of foods.

The call by the United Nations to promote sustainable diets and

has sparked renewed concern about the impact of
protein quality on the adequacy of dietary protein intakes.  Until
recently, most studies have assessed dietary protein adequacy by
comparing crude total protein intake (g/day) with estimates of protein
require&shy;ments, with no adjustments for the potential effect of protein
quality using the methods outlined in Section 16a.4.2.  These studies have
suggested there is a low risk of protein inadequacy in developed
countries based on national survey data

Recently, protein adequacy has been re-examined after correcting for
protein quality (using DIAAS, Section 16a.4.2) and based on usual protein
intakes from adults in U.S NHANES (2001&#8209;2018) dataset

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38253225/"
	target="right" >Moughan et al. 2024</a>). </span>

When protein quality was assumed to be 100% (i.e., DIASS of 1.0
(100% utilizable protein), 11% of adults 19&#8209;50 y had utilizable protein
intakes below the EAR. This proportion increased markedly as the assumed DIASS
declined (e.g., 25% for DIASS=0.8), and was even higher in the elderly
(i.e.,72% for DIASS=0.8).  These prevalence estimates are higher than
any NHANES estimates based on unadjusted crude total protein intake

In many low-income countries, plant-based foods can supply up to
50% of the total protein intake, especially in resource-poor households.
Conse&shy;quently, whether the intakes of protein, after adjustment for
quality and digestibility, are adequate, especially for optimal growth
in children, warrants investigation.  Ghosh et al.

<span data-tippy-content="Ghosh S, Suri D, Uauy R. Assessment of 
protein adequacy in developing countries:

examined the
effect of adjusting total dietary protein for quality and digestibility
based on PDCAAS (Section 16a.5.2) on risk of protein inadequacy in a
meta-analyses of 2005 food balance sheet data from 186 developing
countries and regions.  They showed a higher risk of protein inadequacy
in the food supply in these regions after accounting for protein
quality.  Moreover, adjusted protein supply (i.e., utilizable protein)
was negatively associated with the prevalence of stunting.
<p></p>
However, food balance sheet data provide information on protein
supply, and not intake at the indi&shy;vid&shy;ual level.  A few studies in young
children in low-income countries have examined the adequacy of their
protein intakes at the individual level and accounted for protein quality.  In the earlier
studies, protein intakes were adjusted to account for digestibility
and amino acid score in some studies

At the time, the adjusted protein intakes were not deemed
inad&shy;equate based on the adjustment methods employed, 
and unlikely to be a primary factor limiting the growth of
these preschoolers in Egypt, Kenya, Mexico, and Malawi, despite cereals
being their primary protein source.

More recently, Arsenault and Brown

<span data-tippy-content="Arsenault JE, Brown KH. Dietary Protein Intake in

applied the PDCAAS
method to whole diets to estimate the amount of utilizable protein in
the complementary diets of children aged 6&#8209;36 mos from seven low-income
countries.  Most children were found to consume utilizable protein
intakes greater than their esti&shy;mated require&shy;ments, apart from younger
breastfeeding children (6&#8209;10mos) whose energy intakes from
complementary foods were low.  However, in settings where cassava is the
major dietary staple (e.g., Nigeria and Kenya), there are concerns that
protein intake (unadjusted for protein quality) may be inad&shy;equate 
in children aged 2&#8209;5y 

<span data-tippy-content="Stephenson K, Amthor R, Mallowa S,

In a study in Nigeria, cassava was reported to have a very low protein quality, 
with leucine being the first limiting amino acid, resulting 
in DIAAS being inadequate (&lt;75)

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31997732/"
	target="right" >de Vries-ten Have et al., 2020</a>). </span>

Accumulating
evidence indicates that infection, intestinal dysfunction, and catch&#8209;up
growth are likely to increase protein require&shy;ments in malnourished
children, so their intakes of utilizable protein may not be adequate to
meet their needs.
<p></p>
Clearly, when evaluating the adequacy of protein intakes in both
developed and low-income countries, issues of protein digestibility and
protein quality must be considered.  Such data could inform future
revisions of the protein require&shy;ments and support the development of
food-based dietary guidelines, especially in low-income countries.
<p></p>
Information on protein quality has several other important
applications.  For instance, food security and nutrition could be
improved by cultivating locally available high-protein quality crops

and enhancing the protein quality of traditional
plant-based diets by supplementing with appropriate limiting
indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids or combining different foods that complement
one another.  Finally, there is a growing need for data on the protein
quality of climate-resilient crops to address sustainability issues
