<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Thiamine (vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>1</sub>),  the first vitamin 
discovered and synthesized, plays a critical 
role in energy metabolism, neurological functioning, and 
early cognitive development. Thiamine deficiency 
disorders range broadly in presentation and severity, 
but beriberi can be fatal. Despite its long history, 
and the well-established adverse outcomes of deficiency, 
thiamine lacks both a standardized biomarker 
and interpretative criteria. The most common biomarker 
currently in use is blood thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), 
likely due to the growing availability of high performance 
liquid chromatography equipment and ease of standardization; however the lack 
of clinically meaningful cut-offs limits the practical use of ThDP. 
Although the functional biomarker of erythrocyte 
transketolase activity coefficient (ETKac) is still 
run in a few labs and has a well-established cut-off for deficiency, 
the limitations of working with washed erythrocytes and the 
fact that this assay is not readily available in most 
clinical settings hinders its use. At the individual level, 
use of a therapeutic thiamine challenge remains 
the clear course of action given the safety of thiamine, 
as compared to known severe adverse outcomes 
of untreated thiamine deficiency. At the population level, 
challenges still exist; however, the growing 
interest and method development for thiamine 
assessments via dried blood spots is an exciting prospect. 
Use of dried blood spots could ease sample collection, 
processing, storage, and shipment costs, 
widening the possibility of field-friendly 
assessments, for example, integrated into population-level 
surveys in beriberi-endemic regions. Such thiamine 
assessments would help enormously with properly 
estimating the global burden of thiamine deficiency, 
and triggering appropriate action for 
public health interventions in necessary areas.

The isolation and synthesis of thiamine was carried out in 1933 by Williams and Cline

 The structure of thiamine consists of a pyrimidine and thiazole ring linked by a 
methylene bridge  (<a href="#figure20a.1">Figure&nbsp;20a.1</a>). 
Phosphorylated forms of thiamine include thiamine 
monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) 
and thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), all of 
which can be interconverted in the tissues. 
Of these, ThDP is the biologically active form and 
accounts for nearly 90% of total thiamine in tissues

<h3 id="20a.1.1">20a.1.1 Functions of thiamine</h3>

Thiamine, when converted to ThDP (shown in Figure&nbsp;20a.1.1), 
has a major role in carbo&shy;hydrate 
metabolism. As a co-enzyme in the 
pyruvate dehydro&shy;genase complex, &alpha;&#8209;ketoglutarate 
dehydrogenase complex and the branched chain &alpha;&#8209;keto acid dehydro&shy;
genase complex, ThDP is 
required in both the Kreb's cycle and pentose phosphate pathway

ThDP is also involved in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. Thiamine is required for the 
biosynthesis of neurotransmitters

<h3 id="20a.1.2">20a.1.2 Deficiency of thiamine in humans</h3>

Thiamine deficiency has been classically defined as either Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome among 
chronic alcoholics, or beriberi: wet beriberi for cardiac presentation, dry beriberi for 
neurological symptoms, Shoshin beriberi for rapid onset, or infantile beriberi for pediatric 
presentation. However, the broad and overlapping clinical symptoms of beriberi have recently 
prompted use of the terms &ldquo;thiamine deficiency 
disorders&rdquo;, or &ldquo;thiamine-responsive disorders&rdquo; 
to describe patients with symptoms or disorders that improve with thiamine treatment 


<span data-tippy-content="Whitfield, K. C., Bourassa, M. W., Adamolekun, B., Bergeron, G., Bettendorff, L., Brown, K. H., Cox, L., Fattal-Valevski, A., Fischer, P. R., Frank, E.

Thiamine deficiency has three general pathophysiologic mechanisms

<li class="numbered">increased thiamine losses, caused by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, chronic 
diuretic use, prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, etc.; and/or
<li class="numbered">decreased thiamine intake and/or absorption, caused by malnutrition, alcoholism,

</li></ul>
Thiamine deficiency often presents in low- and middle-income countries where thiamine-poor 
foods like white, polished rice or cassava are staples. Although historically thought to be 
confined to Southeast Asia, more recent reports indicate that thiamine deficiency may be a 
growing concern in South Asia and in other regions, such as Pacific Island nations, where white 
rice is increasingly consumed as a staple

The most common clinical presentation of thiamine deficiency in high-income settings is among 
chronic alcoholics due to general malnutrition and alcohol-induced increases in thiamine 
requirements and impaired thiamine absorption

recently hypothesized that 
thiamine deficiency may be more common, yet unrecognized, among older adults in 
high-income settings presenting with weakness, falling, delirium, and gastro&shy;intestinal symptoms. 


 Thiamine deficiency in older adults could be caused by the co-existence 
of chronic disease burden (i.e. inflammation), insufficient thiamine intake due to age-related 
malnutrition, and increased thiamine losses (i.e., higher diuretic use in this population)

 This is

 Thus, exclusively breastfed infants of mothers with low thiamine intakes could be 
at risk of either mortality via infantile beriberi, or impaired cognitive development, despite
no signs of clinical deficiency. Empirical studies are currently underway to better

<h3 id="20a.1.3">20a.1.3 Food sources and dietary intakes</h3>

Whole grain cereals, pork, and legumes are the richest food sources of thiamine, followed by 
other meats, fish, green vegetables, fruits and milk. Polished rice, sugar, alcohol, fat and other 
refined foods are poor sources of thiamine. Thiamine is thought to be highly bio&shy;available; notable 
losses would occur only with concurrent consumption of known thiamine antagonists such as 
betel nuts or tea, or thiaminase-containing raw fish, ferns, or African silkworm larvae

 Thiamine is absorbed in the proximal small intestine via passive

absorbed

The two most common 
biochemical indices of thiamine status are the direct measure of 
thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) in either whole blood or 
erythro&shy;cytes, or the functional measure that assesses the degree of saturation of the 
ThDP-dependent enzyme trans&shy;ketolase, the erythrocyte transketolase activity coefficient (ETKac). 
Thiamine in erythro&shy;cytes depletes at approx&shy;imately the same rate as other tissues

making blood an ideal proxy for thiamine status. Assessment of thiamine from dried blood 
spots is a growing research area. Other less commonly employed measures, 
serum/plasma thiamine and urinary thiamine excretion, will also be outlined briefly below.
<p>
Regardless of measurement (ThDP or ETKac), blood samples should be collected into blood 
tubes containing an anticoagulant (i.e. heparin or EDTA). Samples are stable at room temp&shy;erature for 
a few hours, at &minus;20&deg;C for a few weeks, and &minus;70&deg;C for several months

ThDP (sometimes along with thiamine 
and thiamine monophosphate (ThMP)) is most often determined via reverse-phase high performance liquid 
chromatography with a fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD). A derivatizing agent (i.e. potassium 
ferricyanide) is used to alter the molecular structure of thiamine to thiochrome (three rings 
rather than two rings of thiamine); it is this three-ring structure that fluoresces and is detected. 
Two detailed methods are published

The lack of a cut-off for eThDP makes it difficult to assess deficiency among individuals. 
However, this is easily overcome by simply administering thiamine in a therapeutic challenge to 
assess thiamine responsiveness. Given the low to null risk of thiamine administration and 
because thiamine-deficient individuals will often respond with rapid clinical improvement within hours 
of treatment, thiamine responsiveness from a therapeutic dose implies deficiency

<p>
At the population level, a consensus eThDP cut-off still needs to be established. This is a clear 
and pressing research question, as population-level risk varies widely depending on the cut-off 
employed. For instance, eThDP was measured in the National Micronutrient Survey linked to 
the Cambodian Demographic and Health Survey (2014) and suboptimal thiamine status ranged 
from 27% to 78% in women of reproductive age and 15% to 58% in children aged 6-69 months, 
depending on which cut-off was employed;

<h3>Factors affecting whole blood or erythrocyte ThDP</h3>

Concern has been raised about the use of the direct assessment of ThDP in 
blood samples in populations with persistently low thiamine intakes, 
such as groups in low- and middle-income countries heavily 
reliant on white, polished rice and likely also at risk of chronic 
inflammation and/or frequent infection. This concern is 
highlighted in a case-control study in rural 
Cambodia that found no differences in whole blood ThDP (corrected for hematocrit) between 
breastfed infants with and without clinical signs of beriberi and the mothers of the
cases and controls   


<span data-tippy-content="Coats, D., Shelton-Dodge, K., Ou, K., Khun, V., Seab, S., Sok, K., Prou, C., Tortorelli, S., Moyer, T. P., Cooper, L. E., Begley, T. P., Enders, F., Fischer, P.

The means (95% CI) ThDP/Hct (i.e.,corrected ThDP) for infant cases and 
controls were 135 (114&ndash;157) and 
159 (133&ndash;184nmol/L) erythro&shy;cytes (p&equals;0.08), 
respectively. For mothers of cases and controls, 
authors reported 141 (126&ndash;158) and 150 (124&ndash;166nmol/L)
erythro&shy;cytes (p&equals;0.46), respectively

 These results call into question whether ThDP is a valid
biomarker of thiamine status.

<h3 id="20a.2.2">20a.2.2 Erythrocyte transketolase activity coefficient (ETKac)</h3>

Transketolase (EC 2.2.1.1) is a ThDP-dependent enzyme. Measurement of the activity of this 
enzyme in erythro&shy;cytes is commonly used as an index of thiamine nutritional status. The 
principle of this assay is to assess the saturation of the ThDP-dependent enzyme transketolase 
by measuring enzyme activity before and after the addition of excess exogenous ThDP. 
<p>
In outline, this assay and similar procedures are used for parallel assays for 
riboflavin and 
pyridoxine and involves the following stages:

<ul>
<li class="numbered">The basal activity of the enzyme (transketolase) 
in erythro&shy;cytes is measured. This 
represents the endogenous enzyme activity and depends on the amount of the 
coenzyme (ThDP) in the erythro&shy;cytes.
<li class="numbered">The enzyme activity with excess coenzyme added <i>in vitro</i> is then determined. This 
equates to the maximum potential enzyme activity and is referred to as total or 
“stimulated” activity.
<li class="numbered"> The basal and enzyme activities are then compared to 
indicate the degree of unsaturation of the enzyme with the coenzyme.
</li>
</ul>
Transketolase catalyzes the following two reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway:

   \[\small\mbox {xylulose-5-phosphate&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;ribose-5-phosphate }\]
   \[&lrhar;\]
 \[\small\mbox {sedoheptulose-7-phosphate&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate}\]

and

   \[\small\mbox {xylulose-5-phosphate&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;erythrose-4-phosphate }\]
  \[&lrhar;\]
   \[\small\mbox {fructose-6-phosphate&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate}\]

The results of this assay are typically expressed in terms of the activity coefficient (ETKac), 
calculated as a ratio of the enzyme activity (with excess coenzyme) 
divided by the basal enzyme 
activity (without coenzyme). When the vitamin status is adequate, the added coenzyme has 
little effect on the total enzyme activity, so the activity coefficient is very close to 1.0. However, 
in vitamin deficiency states, the added coenzyme increases the enzyme activity. Larger 
increases are associated with higher values for the activity coefficient and thus greater degrees 
of deficiency. This is shown diagramatically in 
(<a href="#figure20a.2">Figure&nbsp;20a.2</a>).
<a id="figure20a.2"></a>

<figcaption class="cap">	
Figure&nbsp;20a.2: Diagram of the principle of the erythrocyte transketolase activity coefficient assay
</figcaption>
</figure>
 <p>
Sometimes the percentage of stimulation, also known as the percentage activation &alpha;, is 
calculated from the activity coefficient 
as (ETKac&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100) &minus;&nbsp;100. This is known classically as the 
thiamine pyrophosphate (diphosphate) effect, &ldquo;TPP effect&rdquo;. 
If not reported as a ratio (ETKac), 
the basal and stimulated enzyme activities can be expressed per gram of hemoglobin, per 
number of erythro&shy;cytes, or in terms of the volume of erythro&shy;cytes (in mL).

<h3>Factors affecting erythrocyte transketolase activity</h3>

In thiamine deficiency, the basal level of erythrocyte transketolase activity is low and an 
enhancement in the enzyme activity after the addition of ThDP <i>in vitro</i> is generally observed. 
Prolonged thiamine deficiency, however, induces a reduction in the apotransketolase enzyme 
level. Consequently, both the basal and stimulated erythrocyte transketolase activities tend to 
fall, with no change in the percentage activation &alpha;, giving rise to misleadingly &ldquo;normal&rdquo; ETKac values

<p>
<b>Use of the ETK ratio versus basal activity.</b> The ratio of stimulated to basal enzyme activity is 
used as the primary measure because (a) the inter-subject variation in basal erythrocyte 
enzyme activity is large, and (b) it is assumed that apoenzyme levels are not affected by vitamin 
deficiencies. This latter assumption may not be correct, however

Vitamin deficiency or excess and other factors such as the presence of certain diseases and the

specifically recommend 
interpretation of basal ETK rather than the ratio ETKac among infants. They argue that, due to 
low thiamine exposure <i>in utero</i> and postnatally, apoenzyme may be unstable and 
concentrations may fall. As a result, ETKac could underestimate thiamine deficiency in infancy.
<p>
<b>Age of the erythro&shy;cytes</b> influences enzyme activity; levels decline as the cells age. As a result, 
the basal enzyme activity depends on the mean age of the erythro&shy;cytes

Hence, in patients undergoing treatment for iron deficiency, for example, the basal level of

<b>Age</b> affects transketolase activity. Older individuals tend to have lower activities, possibly as a 
result of a defect in the apoenzyme rather than inadequate activity of the coenzyme

 In some cases (e.g., diabetes and liver disease), the reduced activity results from a 
reduced apoenzyme level associated with the disease. In other diseases (e.g., certain cancers), the 
percentage activation &alpha; is enhanced despite adequate thiamine intakes because the conversion 
of thiamine to ThDP is impaired

 Patients with polyneuritis, uremic

 although the cause is uncertain.
<p>
<b>Intra-subject variation</b> in erythrocyte transketolase activity can be large, even in individuals 
with fixed thiamine intakes

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2261898"

 Such large variations 
occur because individuals differ in their sensitivity to thiamine deficiency. This leads to 
difficulties in interpreting transketolase activity coefficients when values 
are indicative of adequacy (i.e., 1.0) and those indicative of thiamine 
deficiency (i.e., &ge;&nbsp;1.25). Hence, correlation 
of ETKac and intakes within this range may be poor 


<span data-tippy-content="Vir, S. C., & Love, A. H. (1979). Nutritional status of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized aged in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 32(9), 1934–1947.">

target="right" >Vir & Love, 1979</a>).</span>


<p>
In view of these uncertainties, it is perhaps not surprising that ETKac may not 
correlate significantly with thiamine intakes. In general, such relationships have only been 
reported in surveys of population groups known to be vulnerable to thiamine deficiency, such 
as the elderly. Correlations, however, are less obvious in groups such as adolescents who are more 
likely to have adequate thiamine intakes

For infants in particular, the volume of 
blood, invasiveness of venipuncture, and the need to hire pediatric phlebotomists, may lead to 
challenges with traditional venous blood collection. The utilization of dried blood spots 
addresses many of these challenges, simplifying both sample collection and storage. Dried 
blood spots would allow fingerprick capillary blood collection to replace venipuncture and 
there is potential for ambient, rather than &minus;80&deg;C 
freezer, storage

Even if cold chain transport is required, dried blood spots are much smaller and pose a lower 
biohazard risk, than aliquots of frozen blood.

A few different methods employing dried blood spot sample collection have been published in 
recent years. Mathew et&nbsp;al.

 validated a method using HPLC-FLD. However, the method requires a known volume of 
venous blood pipetted onto the filter paper cards, limiting its practical use.

<p>
In 2020, a method to assess ThDP, as well as thiamine and ThMP from 
capillary dried blood spots was developed by 


<span data-tippy-content="Huang, Y., Gibson, R. A., & Green, T. J. (2020). Measuring thiamine status in dried blood spots. Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry, 509, 52–59.">
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32505772"

 Authors collected venous whole blood samples 
(stored at &minus;80&deg;C until analysis), as well as 
capillary fingerprick samples (stored at &minus;20&deg;C until 
analysis), from 20&nbsp;healthy Australian volunteers. There was a strong linear 
correlation between the results for 
venous whole blood ThDP and capillary dried blood 
spot ThDP (r&equals;0.9636; p&lt;&nbsp;0.001). ThDP 
coefficients of variation (%CVs) for low and high quality controls were: intra-day: 3.5% and
2.7%, respectively; inter-day: 4.3% and 3.0%, respectively.  Nevertheless, the ThDP measured in 
capillary dried blood spots was 6.4% higher as compared to venous whole blood, which authors 
speculated could be attributed to the higher hematocrit values of capillary samples. Hence, although
promising, this method has a few limitations. While sample extraction from the filter paper
cards was completed with a standard 6.35mm punch disc, a practice intended to minimize the need for 
hematocrit assessment, a limitation of this method is the unknown sample volume. In addition,
cold chain storage is likely to still be required for this method: although ThDP appeared to be stable
when dried blood spot cards were stored at &minus;20&deg;C, preliminary analyses showed significant
losses during ambient storage

<p>
As noted above, a standard sample volume or hematocrit assessment is essential because ThDP is 
found mainly in erythro&shy;cytes 

<span data-tippy-content="Whitfield, K. C., Bourassa, M. W., Adamolekun, B., Bergeron, G., Bettendorff, L., Brown, K. H., Cox, L., Fattal-Valevski, A., Fischer, P. R., Frank, E.

 However, Verstraete and Stove recently 
reported a novel method employing volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS), wherein a 
collection device with a plastic handler and polymeric tip absorbs a fixed volume of blood, thus 
negating the need for additional hematocrit assessment 

 <span data-tippy-content="Verstraete, J., & Stove, C. (2021). Volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) as a reliable tool to assess thiamine status in dried blood microsamples: a comparative study. The American journal of clinical nutrition, nqab146. Advance online publication.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020458"

 Authors 
reported good agreement between venous whole blood and capillary VAMS samples, with a 
mean bias of &minus;1.0% (95% CI: &minus;4.1%, 2.0%) 
which was not significantly different from zero. The 
%CVs were 6.5% and 2.2% for capillary VAMS and venous whole blood samples, respectively. 
&ldquo;Uncontrolled transport&rdquo; was also assessed 
by sending capillary VAMS samples through the 
regular mail, thus subjecting samples to 2&ndash;5d of 
ambient conditions. These &ldquo;uncontrolled&rdquo; 
samples had a mean difference of 1.0% (95% CI: &minus;18.6%, 20.6%) 
and 1.0% (95% CI: &minus;14.7%, 16.7%) in two analyses when compared 
to &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; capillary VAMS samples that had been 
stored at &minus;80&deg;C until analysis. Although only 3% of samples exceeded a 20% difference 
threshold set to compare &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;uncontrolled&rdquo; samples, the wide 95% CI is of concern 
and cold chain transport and storage may still be warranted. This is particularly true as these 
&ldquo;controlled&rdquo; samples were mailed during the 
Belgian winter, when ambient temp&shy;eratures were 
likely low

 However, during method development Verstraete and 
Stove reported that VAMS samples were stable for 1 month at room temp&shy;erature, or for 1 
week at either 60&deg;C or at 80% humidity

<p>
A strength of this method is the vastly simplified sample collection and known sample volume. 
Although promising, this method comparison was completed among 50&nbsp;healthy Belgian 
volunteers with relatively high ThDP concentrations. As such, method assessment among 
participants with lower thiamine status and with health profiles more common in beriberi-
endemic regions (e.g. higher inflammation, genetic hemoglobin disorders, environmental 
enteric dysfunction, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, etc) should be undertaken.

<h3>Interpretive criteria</h3>

To date, published work has focussed on method development and comparisons; no thiamine 
assessments have been completed at large scale with dried blood spot samples. As a result, 
appropriate cut-offs have not yet been established. Although the same HPLC-FLD or LC-MS/MS 
methods are employed as those used for venous samples, the established differences between 
venous and capillary blood should be taken into account when a cut-off is established. In both 
infants and adults, capillary blood samples have higher hematocrit and red blood cell counts 
than venous samples

However, the use of serum or plasma thiamine concentrations to assess thiamine status is 
generally not advised, as these assessments often measure free thiamine or ThMP, which are 
not reflective of total body stores

 In addition, serum or plasma would only 
reflect recent intake rather than true tisssue thiamine status

 Serum or plasma 
thiamine could also be impacted by various disease states such as acute hepatic injury and is 
thought to be transiently decreased in critically ill patients after trauma or those experiencing 
sepsis

<h3 id="20a.2.5">20a.2.5 Urinary thiamine excretion</h3>

Urinary thiamine is no longer a common method of thiamine assessment. Collection of 24h
urine samples is logistically challenging and imposes a high participant burden. Although casual 
urine samples can be collected, when thiamine excretion is expressed per g creatinine, urinary 
thiamine is still not the best indicator of status. For instance, urinary thiamine excretion did not 
correlate well with ETKac, or with clinical signs of deficiency among  a group of 79&nbsp;alcoholic 
patients in Australia 


<span data-tippy-content="Wood, B., Breen, K. J., & Penington, D. G. (1977). Thiamine status in alcoholism. Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine, 7(5), 475–484.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/272167"
target="right" >Wood et&nbsp;al., 1977</a>).</span>


<p>
In principle, among thiamine-replete individuals, when the main tissue compartment is 
saturated and the urinary excretion threshold is exceeded, thiamine levels in the urine do not 
generally reflect body stores; instead, they parallel recent dietary intakes. In contrast, when the 
tissues are unsaturated, excretion is limited because the body conserves thiamine. When 
dietary intakes are sufficient, for example 0.5mg thiamine per 1,000kcal, approx&shy;imately 100&micro;g thiamine is 
excreted 


<span data-tippy-content="Sauberlich H. E. (1967). Biochemical alterations in thiamine deficiency--their interpretation. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 20(6), 528–546.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6027577"
target="right" >Sauberlich, 1967</a>).</span>

 At lower intakes, however, urinary excretion of thiamine is no 
longer linearly related to intake 


<span data-tippy-content="Oldham H. G. (1962). Thiamine requirements of women. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 98, 542–549.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14481708"
target="right" >Oldham, 1962</a>).</span>

This critical point is thought to be around 
intakes of 0.2mg thiamine per 1,000kcal, yielding urinary 
thiamine excretions between 5&ndash;20&micro;g 
thiamine, with clinical beriberi cases yielding excretions 
of 0&ndash;15&micro;g thiamine 

<span data-tippy-content="Sauberlich H. E. (1967). Biochemical alterations in thiamine deficiency--their interpretation. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 20(6), 528–546.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6027577"
target="right" >Sauberlich, 1967</a>).</span>


In addition, at low thiamine intakes, most of the thiamine excretion is in the form of 
metabolites such as pyramin, an 
even less sensitive measure than urinary thiamine

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6027577"
target="right" >Sauberlich, 1967</a>).</span>


<p>
The intra-subject variability for urinary thiamine excretion based on a single 24h urine sample 
is high, with %CVs ranging from 11% to 13%, even for participants on a constant diet for 60d

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2261898"
target="right" >van Dokkum et&nbsp;al., 1990</a>).</span>

 Furthermore, urinary thiamine excretion is increased by the use of 
certain drugs, particularly diuretics 


<span data-tippy-content="Suter, P. M., & Vetter, W. (2000). Diuretics and vitamin&nbsp;B1: are diuretics a risk factor for thiamin malnutrition?. Nutrition reviews, 58(10), 319–323.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11127971"
target="right" >Suter & Vetter, 2000</a>).</span>

In addition, age-specific interpretive 
criteria are likely to be necessary as children have higher levels of thiamine excretion than adults 
when expressed on a per g creatinine basis

<h2 id="20a.3">20a.3 Conclusions</h2>

Despite its long history and the well-established adverse effects of deficiency, thiamine 
lacks both a standardized biochemical biomarker and interpretative criteria. The most common biomarker 
currently in use is blood ThDP, likely due to the growing availability of HPLC-FLD and ease of 
standardization. However, the lack of clinically meaningful cut-offs limits the practical use of blood ThDP.
Although ETKac is still measured in a few laboratories and has a well-established cut-off for deficiency, the lack of 
availability of the assay limits its use. At the individual level, use of a therapeutic thiamine 
challenge remains the clear course of action given the safety of thiamine, when compared to 
the known severe adverse outcomes of untreated thiamine deficiency. At the population level, 
challenges still exist. However, the growing interest and method development for thiamine 
assessment via dried blood spots is an exciting prospect. Use of dried blood spots could ease 
sample collection, processing, storage and shipment costs, thus extending the possibility of field-
friendly assessments, such as integration into population-level surveys in beriberi-endemic 
regions. Such thiamine assessments would provide improved estimates of the global burden of thiamine 
deficiency and trigger appropriate action for public health interventions 
in necessary areas. Future research should continue exploring: 1) large-scale testing of dried 
blood spot samples and potentially also the development of a point-of-care thiamine 
assessment; 2) the development of interpretative criteria for whole blood ThDP; and 3) 
improved inter-laboratory and standardization of ETKac.
