Anthro&shy;pometric indices of growth and body composition are compiled
from two or more anthro&shy;pometric measurements. The indices most
frequently used for children include weight-for-height, height-for-age,
weight-for-age, body mass index (BMI)-for-age, and mid-upper-arm
circumference (MUAC)-for age. The methods recom&shy;mended to evaluate
these anthro&shy;pometric indices use
either per&shy;cent&shy;iles or Z&#8209;score
calculated in relation to the distri&shy;bution of the anthro&shy;pometric
indices for a reference population. The World Health Organization (WHO)
recom&shy;mends for inter&shy;national use the prescriptive
WHO Child Growth Standards for those age
<span class="n">0&ndash;5y</span>
and the WHO Growth Reference for those age
<span class="n">5&ndash;19y.</span> New inter&shy;national
prescriptive growth standards are also available for
gestational weight gain, fetal and newborn growth, and
postnatal growth for pre-term infants.  In clinical settings,
serial anthro&shy;pometric measurements are used to track
an individual's  growth pattern, and identify abnormal changes
in growth and their response to treatment. In public health,
screening systems, that include at least one anthro&shy;pometric
measurement or index in combination with one or more reference limits or
cutoff points, can be used to identify &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; individuals.
At the population level, screening can be used to compare and monitor the preva&shy;lence
and severity of malnutrition within and across countries,
and to monitor progress. Examples include use of
height-for-age &lt;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score to identify and monitor stunting,
weight-for-height &lt;&minus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;score or
MUAC &lt;&nbsp;115mm to identify and monitor severe, acute, malnutrition
in children
<span class="n">6&ndash;60mos,</span> BMI&#8209;for&#8209;age Z&#8209;score
or BMI for overweight and obesity in children and adults, respectively,
and a composite index of anthro&shy;pometric failure (CIAF).
Public health applications of anthropometry discussed
in this chapter include: (a) inter&shy;national comparisons of
growth; (b) identifying determinants and consequences of
malnutrition; (c) targeting  interventions; (d) assessing
responses to interventions; and e) nutritional surveillance.
Several   methods recom&shy;mended for evaluating anthro&shy;pometric
indicators are also emphasized, the choice depending
on the objectives and design of the study.

<h2 id="13.0">13.0   Introduction</h2>

Standardized methods of evaluating anthro&shy;pometric indices
are essential to assess nutritional status and to identify
mal&shy;nut&shy;rition in individuals or populations.  Two methods are
used based on Z&#8209;scores or per&shy;cent&shy;iles, both calculated in
relation to the distri&shy;bution of the anthro&shy;pometric indices for
a reference population. The World Health Organization (WHO)
recom&shy;mends the use of the WHO Child Growth Standards for
young children
<span class="n">0&ndash;5y</span> inter&shy;nationally. They were compiled
using a prescriptive approach depicting physiological
human growth under optimal conditions. Hence, they
represent how young children <i>should</i> grow, rather than as a
&ldquo;reference&rdquo; describing how children <i>do</i> grow.
The WHO Child Growth Standards are
recom&shy;mended for inter&shy;national use because the effects of
ethnic and genetic differences on the growth of infants and
young children are small compared with the environmental,
nutritional, and socio-economic effects on growth, some of
which may persist across generations. The reference
population recom&shy;mended for assessing the growth of older
children is the WHO Growth Reference data for school-age
children and adolescence.
<p>
A series of prescriptive standards for monitoring fetal,
newborn growth, and gestational weight gain have also been
developed by the INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup> project for inter&shy;national
use. This project adhered to the WHO recom&shy;mendations for
assessing human size and growth

In clinical setting, serial anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ments can be
used to track the pattern of growth and body composition
over time. They can also be used to identify and classify an
individual as &ldquo;mal&shy;nourished&rdquo; or
of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; nutritional status
by comparison with either pre&shy;determined reference limits,
often termed cutoff points.  Individuals may also be classified
into risk categories indicative of the severity or type of
mal&shy;nut&shy;rition.
<p>
However, serial measure&shy;ments are often not possible in public
health. Instead, screening systems, which include at least one
anthro&shy;pometric measurement or index in combination with the recom&shy;mended
reference limit or cutoff point are used to identify individuals
in the population &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; to mal&shy;nut&shy;rition.
Examples of measurements or indices
used in this way and discussed below include
weight-for-height, body mass index (BMI), MUAC (to identify severe acute
mal&shy;nut&shy;rition), and a composite index of anthro&shy;pometric
failure (CIAF). Data derived from screening systems can be
used to compare and/or monitor the preva&shy;lence of
mal&shy;nut&shy;rition across populations, and to assess the need for, or
impact of, inter&shy;ventions both within and across countries. In
some cases, reference limits can be com&shy;bined with
&ldquo;preva&shy;lence thresholds&rdquo; to describe and compare populations
according to levels of severity of mal&shy;nut&shy;rition, and identify
priority populations for action. Prevalence thresholds can also
be used by governments to trigger action, and to monitor and
evaluate the impact of interventions.
<p>
Anthropometry can also be used to characterize the
nutritional status of a population or to highlight changes in
their nutritional status with successive measure&shy;ments over
time (i.e., surveillance).  To achieve these objectives, a
comparison of the frequency distri&shy;bution of anthro&shy;pometric
indices of the entire population in relation to the
recom&shy;mended reference data using Z&#8209;scores (in developing
countries) or per&shy;cent&shy;iles is recom&shy;mended.
<p>
Details of the methods recom&shy;mended by WHO for evaluating
anthro&shy;pometric indices, followed by a review of the systems
used to identify and classify risk of mal&shy;nut&shy;rition at the
individual and population levels, are discussed
below.  Examples of the applications of anthropometry in
public health are also included together with details of the
designs and statistical procedures that can be used to evaluate
inter&shy;vention programs.

<h2 id="13.1">13.1   Anthro&shy;pometric indices and their modes of expression </h2>

Details of the standardized procedures for the measure&shy;ments of
body size and body composition are outlined in Chapters&nbsp;10 and&nbsp;11.
Raw measure&shy;ments, however, have little meaning unless
they are related to, for example, the age or sex of an individual

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="WHO (World Health Organization). (1995). Physical Status.: The Use and Inter&shy;pretation of Anthropometry. Technical Report Series No. 854. World Health Organization, Geneva.">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241208546"
target="right" >WHO, 1995</a>). </span>

Hence, the correct interpretation of anthro&shy;pometric
measure&shy;ments requires the use of anthro&shy;pometric indices.
They are usually compiled from two or
more raw measure&shy;ments. Details of indices of body size
and body composition are also available in
Chapter&nbsp;10 and&nbsp;11, respectively. In children,
the four most commonly used anthro&shy;pometric
indices are weight-for-height, height-for-age, weight-for-age,
and body mass index &mdash; defined as
weight / (height)<sup>2</sup> (kg/m<sup>2</sup>).
<p>
<b>Weight-for-height</b> measures body weight relative to height.
Low weight-for-height is described
as &ldquo;thinness&rdquo; and reflects a&nbsp;pathological
process referred to as &ldquo;wasting&rdquo;. It arises from a&nbsp;failure
to gain sufficient weight relative to height or from losing weight.
High weight-for-height in children is referred to as
&ldquo;over&shy;weight&rdquo; and arises from
gaining excess weight relative to height or from gaining
insufficient height relative to weight.
<p>
<b>Height-for-age</b> is a&nbsp;measure of achieved linear
growth and can be used as an index of past
nutritional or health status.
Recumbent length is measured in infants and children less than 2y,
and height in older children.
Low height-for-age is defined as &ldquo;shortness&rdquo; and reflects either
normal variation or a&nbsp;pathological process involving
a failure to reach a linear growth potential. The outcome of the latter process
is referred to as &ldquo;stunting&rdquo;
or the gaining of insufficient height relative to age

<span data-tippy-content="Physical status: the use and interpretation of anthropometry. Report of a WHO Expert Committee. (1995). World Health Organization technical report series, 854, 1–452.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8594834/"
target="right" >WHO, 1995</a>)</span>.

The etiology of stunting is multifactorial, often  resulting
from a&nbsp;combination of extended periods of inadequate
food intake, poor dietary quality, and increased morbidity.
<p></p>
<b>Weight-for-age</b> reflects body mass relative to chronological age.
Low weight-for-age is described as &ldquo;lightness&rdquo;
and reflects a&nbsp;pathological process
referred to as &ldquo;under&shy;weight&rdquo;, arising
from gaining insufficient weight
relative to age, or losing weight.
High weight-for-age can be described as &ldquo;heaviness&rdquo;
but this term is seldom used: high weight-for-height
is more useful as a proxy for &ldquo;overweight&rdquo;
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Physical Status.: The Use and Inter&shy;pretation of Anthropometry. Technical Report Series No. 854. World Health Organization, Geneva.">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241208546"
target="right" >WHO, 1995</a>). </span>
<p>
A&nbsp;major limitation of weight-for-age is that it reflects
both weight-for-height and height-for-age. It fails
to distinguish tall, thin children from those
who are short with adequate weight. Thus, children
with a&nbsp;low weight-for-age may be genetically short
or their low weight-for-age may result from
&ldquo;stunting&rdquo; or nutritional growth failure.
Consequently, weight-for-height and height-for-age are
the preferred anthro&shy;pometric indices of body size for
children because, in combination, they can
distinguish wasting and stunting.

<b>Body mass index (BMI) </b>is the inter&shy;nationally
recom&shy;mended index of over&shy;weight and obesity in
children and adults and calculated as:

\[\small\mbox{weight(kg)/ height(m)}^{2} \]

An increased BMI-for-age in childhood and adolescence is
associated with a higher percentage of body fat, which is
a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20233144/"
target="right" >de&nbsp;Onis and Lobstein, 2010</a>)</span>.

However, BMI alone does not
distinguish between weight associated with muscle,
and weight associated with body fat.
Hence, in some circum&shy;stances, an elevated BMI may result
from adiposity, muscularity, or edema.
Furthermore, BMI is insensitive to the actual distri&shy;bution of body fat

<a href="#table13.1">Table&nbsp;13.1</a>
summarizes the information that can be obtained from
each of the four growth indices discussed above.
<p>
Note that to interpret any single measure&shy;ment of either weight or
stature in relation to the reference data, the
exact age of the child at the date of the measure&shy;ment must be known.
Software such as WHO AnthroPlus can calculate exact ages in
decimal fractions of a year, from birth and visit dates.
In the event that documentary evidence of the date of birth is not
available, it may be necessary to obtain at least the month
and year of birth using a local event calendar.
Information on the develop&shy;ment of a local event calendar is
available from FAO

<p>
For studies of both individuals and populations,
the anthro&shy;pometric indices can be compared to
the reference population using per&shy;cent&shy;iles or Z&#8209;scores
derived from the reference data.
The reference populations recom&shy;mended are the WHO Child Growth Standards

aged <span class="n">0&ndash;5y</span>
from six diverse geographic sites (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway,
Oman, and the U.S.), as noted earlier. The study com&shy;bined a longitudinal

A prescriptive approach was taken
for the develop&shy;ment of these growth standards with the goal
of providing a single inter&shy;national reference that
represents the best description of physiological growth
for all children &le;&nbsp;5y and to establish the
breastfed infant as the normative model for growth and develop&shy;ment.

was the same as that used for the WHO Child Growth Standard.

<p>
In most industrialized countries,
per&shy;cent&shy;iles are used, whereas in low-income
countries, the use of Z&#8209;scores is recom&shy;mended.
The proportion of individuals with indices below
predefined reference limits
based on per&shy;cent&shy;iles or Z&#8209;scores can
also be assessed and are widely used
as indicators of community status.
<p>
In some circum&shy;stances, per&shy;cent&shy;iles and Z&#8209;scores
cannot be calculated and, instead, the anthro&shy;pometric
indices are expressed in terms of percent-of-median.
Percent-of-median, however, provides only limited
information on the relative position of the value within the
population and as a&nbsp;consequence, is rarely used today.

<h3 id="13.1.1">13.1.1:  Percentiles</h3>

A&nbsp;per&shy;cent&shy;ile refers to the position of the
measure&shy;ment value in relation to all the
measure&shy;ments for the reference population, ranked in order
of magnitude.

is a&nbsp;cumulative frequency
distri&shy;bution of the heights of boys aged 13y,
illustrating the use of per&shy;cent&shy;iles. In this figure, a
height of 152cm represents the 50<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile. This means
that 50% of the boys in the reference population have a
height at or below this value and 50% at or above this
value. Similarly, 10% of the boys have a&nbsp;height at or below
the 10<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile that, in Figure&nbsp;13.1, falls at
141.8cm. For data with a&nbsp;Gaussian distri&shy;bution (e.g. height
for age), the 50<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile corresponds to both the mean
and the median; for skewed data (e.g. weight-for-age), the
50<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile corresponds to the median.

<p>
Sometimes, when calculating per&shy;cent&shy;iles, adjustments are
made for parental stature, to distinguish between genetic
and pathological effects in a&nbsp;child who is unusually short.
The magnitude of the adjustment tends to be
greater for older children. An example of adjustments based
on mid-parent height is given in Himes et&nbsp;al.

<p>
Adjustments are also important when evaluating the growth
per&shy;cent&shy;iles of both low birth
weight (i.e.,&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2500g) and preterm infants
(i.e.,&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;38wk gestation). Specialized growth charts are available for

<p>
The per&shy;cent&shy;ile reference limits commonly
used for designating individuals as &ldquo;at&nbsp;risk&rdquo; to
mal&shy;nu&shy;trition are either below the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;iles or
above the 97<sup>th</sup> or 95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;iles. The limits chosen depend
on the reference data used.
<p>
Use of per&shy;cent&shy;iles is recom&shy;mended for the evaluation of anthro&shy;pometric
measure&shy;ments from relatively well-nourished populations from
industrialized countries, as no errors are introduced if the
data have a&nbsp;skewed distri&shy;bution. Weight-for-age, weight-for-height,
and many circumferential and skinfold indices have skewed distri&shy;butions.
<p>
Percentiles are not recom&shy;mended for
evaluating anthro&shy;pometric indices of individuals
or populations from low-income countries
if reference data from industrialized countries, such as
the US CDC 2000

<span data-tippy-content="Kuczmarski, R. J., Ogden, C. L., Grummer-Strawn, L. M., Flegal, K. M., Guo, S. S., Wei, R., Mei, Z., Curtin, L. R., Roche, A. F., & Johnson, C. L. (2000). CDC growth charts: United States. Advance data, (314), 1–27.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11183293/"

are used. In such circum&shy;stances, an individual, or many participants
with large deficits in
weight and height, may have indices below the extreme
per&shy;cent&shy;ile of the reference distri&shy;bution
(i.e. below 3<sup>rd</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile), making
it difficult to characterize the magnitude of the
deficit for the individual or accurately
classify large numbers of individuals

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/304391/"
target="right" >Waterlow et al., 1977</a>).</span>

Moreover, because data from a&nbsp;population, expressed in terms
of per&shy;cent&shy;iles, are often not normally distributed, such
populations cannot be correctly described in terms of means
and standard deviations of the per&shy;cent&shy;iles.

<h3 id="13.1.2">13.1.2     Z&#8209;scores</h3>

The World Health Organization recom&shy;mends the use of Z&#8209;scores
for evaluating anthro&shy;pometric data from low-income countries

<span data-tippy-content="Gorstein, J., Sullivan, K., Yip, R., de&nbsp;Onís, M., Trowbridge, F., Fajans, P., & Clugston, G. (1994). Issues in the assessment of nutritional status using anthropometry. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 72(2), 273–283.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8205648/"
target="right" >Gorstein et al., 1994</a>),</span>

because Z&#8209;scores can be calculated accurately beyond
the limits of the original reference data. This is an
advantage in low-income countries because individuals with
indices below the extreme per&shy;cent&shy;iles of the reference data
can then be classified accurately.
<p>
The method measures the deviation of the
anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ment from the reference median in
terms of standard deviations (SD) or  Z&#8209;scores.
The score is a&nbsp;measure of an individual's value with
respect to the distri&shy;bution of the reference population.
<p>
Z&#8209;scores are calculated differently for measure&shy;ments
that are distributed normally (e.g., height-
for-age) and non-normally in the reference
population (e.g., weight-for-age). The Z&#8209;score for a
measure&shy;ment that is normally distributed corresponds to:<br>
\[\small \mbox{Z&#8209;score =} \frac{\mbox{(observed value)&minus;(median reference value)}}{\mbox{ standard deviation of the reference population}}\]
<p></p>
As an example,  a&nbsp;boy called Sam  is 96.1cm tall, and aged 2y and 4mo
<ul style= "font-size:16px">
<li>the observed value is Sam's height (96.1cm). </li>
<li>the median reference value for height of all boys who are Sam's age
(2y and 4mo) is 90.4cm.</li>
<li>the standard deviation of boy's height at 2y and 4mos is 3.3.
The standard deviation of boy's height can be thought of
as the average of differences from the median for each member
of the reference population.</li>
<li>inserting the above numbers in the formula, Sam's Z&#8209;score is calculated as:
\[\small \frac{(96.1&minus; 90.4)}{  3.3 } &equals;  1.73\]
</li>	
</ul>
Note: Sam's height-for age could also be plotted manually on the WHO Child Growth Chart for
boys aged  <span class="n">2&ndash;5y</span> shown in
<a href="#figure13.3">Figure&nbsp;13.3</a>.

<p>
However, the above formula cannot be used for measurements
that are not normally distributed such as weight-for-age,
weight-for-height, and BMI-for-age, because the distances between adjacent Z&#8209;scores are not constant.  As a&nbsp;result, an
LMS formula is used to calculate the Z&#8209;scores for
measure&shy;ments that are skewed. For more
details, see Cole

Note that for measure&shy;ments that fall

a modified version of the LMS formula must be applied

As noted earlier for per&shy;cent&shy;iles, for clinical use, the Z&#8209;score range within
which the measure&shy;ment of an individual falls can also be read from

<p>
WHO has also developed a tool for the application of the
WHO Child Growth Standards which includes instructions of
how to take the measure&shy;ments, interpret growth indicators,
investigate causes of growth problems, and how to counsel caregivers.
A child age calculator is available as part of the course materials
for the trainers and available in WHO Regional Offices.
An anthro&shy;pometry training

(<a href="https://www.who.int/toolkits/child-growth-standards"

is also available.
Motor milestone windows of achievement have also been developed
and are available from
(<a href="https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/standards/motor-development-milestones" target="right" >WHO.</a>)
<p>
Guidelines have also been developed on the use of the fixed exclusion method to identify implausible Z&#8209;score value for each anthro&shy;pometric growth index based on the WHO Child Growth Standard. Z&#8209;score values outside the following intervals are considered implausible:
<ul>
<li>HAZ (below &minus;6, or above &plus;6);
<li>WHZ (below &minus;5, or above &plus;5);
<li>WAZ (below &minus;6, or above &plus;5).
</li></ul>When using WHO AnthroPlus these &ldquo;implausible&rdquo; values for
each anthro&shy;pometric Z&#8209;score are flagged independently and the
percentage of implausible values for each index calculated.
Note:  the date of birth (month and year) is required to calculate Z&#8209;scores and errors in this date information are a major source of implausible values.
A percentage of implausible values that exceeds 1% is said to indicate
poor data quality. However, inaccurate values may still exist within
the rather generous flag range set by WHO, so even a low percentage does not
necessarily imply adequate data quality.
<p>
WHO also recom&shy;mends calculating the standard deviation (SD) of Z&#8209;scores
for each anthro&shy;pometric growth index as an additional
assessment of data quality.
This is important because an inflated SD arising
from poor quality data results in preva&shy;lence estimates that are
likely to be overestimated. Currently, WHO has not set
cut-offs at which SDs for each anthro&shy;pometric index are related
to poor data quality. Instead, WHO suggests that
strata specific SDs that are greater than the SD
for the national estimate should be examined and
highlighted in any survey report.  More details on
standardizing the analysis, interpretation, and reporting
of anthro&shy;pometric data for infants are available from

In population studies, the number and the proportion of

and as noted previously for
per&shy;cent&shy;iles (<a href="#figure13.2">Figure&nbsp;13.2</a>). In addition, the proportion of individuals with
anthro&shy;pometric indices below or above some predetermined
reference limits defined by Z&#8209;scores can also be determined.
Often scores of below &minus;2 or above &plus;2
are used to designate  individuals with either unusually low or
unusually high anthro&shy;pometric indices.
This approach is used because statistically 95%
of the inter&shy;national reference population fall within the central range.
Theoretically the
proportion of children with a&nbsp;Z&#8209;score  less than
&minus;2 or greater than &plus;2 in a study
population should be &asymp;&nbsp;2.3%.
Clearly, if the proportion in the study
population with such low or high Z&#8209;scores is
significantly greater than this,
then the study population is seriously affected.
<p>
 The WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition
uses a&nbsp;Z&#8209;score less than &minus;2 to classify
low weight-for-age as &ldquo;under&shy;weight&rdquo;, low length/height-for-age
as &ldquo;stunted&rdquo;, and low weight-for-length as &ldquo;wasted&rdquo;

population-based cohorts in Pelostas, Brazil,
<span class="n">1982&ndash;2015.</span>
The preva&shy;lence of stunting declined by 53% (from 8.3% to&nbsp;3.9%)
from 1982 to&nbsp;2015. Wasting preva&shy;lence remained stable
at low levels (1.8% in&nbsp;1982 and 1.7% in&nbsp;2015),
whereas over&shy;weight increased by 88% (6.5% to&nbsp;12.2%).

Note that the current preva&shy;lence of stunting in Pelostas is
over twice, and that of under&shy;weight over five times
higher than the 2.3% that would be expected in a
well-nourished population.

Indicators for over&shy;weight and obesity in both young and older children
and adolescents are also based on &nbsp;Z&#8209;scores for BMI-for-age
of the WHO Child Growth Standard

 and
the WHO growth reference 2007.
For children
<span class="n">(0&ndash;5y)</span> a  Z&#8209;score for
 BMI-for-age above &plus;1
is described as  being &ldquo;at risk of over&shy;weight&rdquo;,
above &plus;2 as &ldquo;over&shy;weight&rdquo;
and above &plus;3 as &ldquo;obese&rdquo;.
For children greater than &ge;&nbsp;5y, de&nbsp;Onis and Lobstein

suggest using the adult classification scheme;
children with BMI Z&#8209;scores above &plus;1
are described as being &ldquo;over&shy;weight&rdquo;
and above &plus;2&nbsp;&ldquo;as obese&rdquo;.
<p>
An important advantage of using Z&#8209;scores
for population-based applications is that it is
valid to calculate the mean and standard deviation
for a group of Z&#8209;scores. This allows
the nutritional status of the entire population
to be described. In addition, because
the observed Z&#8209;scores from a population are
often normally distributed, statistical analytical
procedures that assume normality such
as t-tests and regression methods can be used
<span data-tippy-content="Gorstein, J., Sullivan, K., Yip, R., de&nbsp;Onís, M., Trowbridge, F., Fajans, P., & Clugston, G. (1994). Issues in the assessment of nutritional status using anthropometry. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 72(2), 273–283.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8205648/"
target="right" >Gorstein et al., 1994</a>).</span>
<p>
In some circum&shy;stances, however, a mean
Z&#8209;score will not be useful. For example, in some studies
of refugees, the death rate among those most severely
malnourished can be high and the lower end of the
distri&shy;bution can be truncated: the mean is hardly affected

<span data-tippy-content="Yip, R., & Sharp, T. W. (1993). Acute malnutrition and high childhood mortality related to diarrhea. Lessons from the 1991 Kurdish refugee crisis. JAMA, 270(5), 587–590.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8331756/"
target="right" >Yip and Sharp, 1993</a>).</span>

In such cases, a&nbsp;comparison of the distri&shy;bution of indices
of the entire population in relation to the reference population
is more useful (<a href="#figure13.4">Figure&nbsp;13.4</a>).
<p></p>
If the distri&shy;bution of the reference values is normal,
per&shy;cent&shy;iles and Z&#8209;scores are directly related,

a&nbsp;Z&#8209;score of &minus;1.645
corresponds to an obser&shy;vation on the 5<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile.
Conversely, a&nbsp;value that is at the 85<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile equates
to Z&#8209;score of &plus;1.036. The commonly used &minus;3, &minus;2,
and &minus;1&nbsp;Z&#8209;scores are the 0.13<sup>th</sup>, 2.28<sup>th</sup>, and
15.8<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;iles.
An easy way to assess whether the
distri&shy;bution is skewed is to compare the values of the mean
and the median. For normal distri&shy;butions the mean and median
will be very similar. As the distri&shy;bution becomes more
skewed, the difference between mean and median increases.
Several tests are available for testing normality. Examples
include the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff and the Cox tests, of which
the latter is generally preferred.
<p></p>
The characteristics of the three anthro&shy;pometric reporting
systems &mdash; Z&#8209;scores, per&shy;cent&shy;iles, and
percent-of-median &mdash; are compared in
<a href="#table13.3">Table&nbsp;13.3</a>.
The inter&shy;pretation of reference limits based on
per&shy;cent&shy;iles and Z&#8209;scores, is believed to be consistent across all ages and
indices. This means that a&nbsp;reference
limit of 3<sup>rd</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile or &minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;scores represents the same
degree of mal&shy;nut&shy;rition, irrespective of the anthro&shy;pometric
index used (e.g. weight-for-age or weight-for-height) or the
age of the child

<h3 id="13.1.3">13.1.3   Height-for-age difference</h3>

There is some debate about using absolute (centimeters)
vs. relative (Z&#8209;scores) scales to describe
changes in growth in populations of children over time.
Leroy and colleagues

<span data-tippy-content="Leroy, J. L., Ruel, M., Habicht, J. P., & Frongillo, E. A. (2014). Linear growth deficit continues to accumulate beyond the first 1000 days in low- and middle-income countries: global evidence from 51 national surveys. The Journal of nutrition, 144(9), 1460–1466.">

argue that although HAZ is useful to assess childen's attained
height at a&nbsp;given age, HAZ is inappropriate
to evaluate changes in height as children age at both the individual
and population level. As shown earlier in the example of the Z&#8209;score
calculation of an individual, the construction of a&nbsp;Z&#8209;score
for height-for-age uses as a&nbsp;denominator the
Z&#8209;score of the reference population. The Z&#8209;score is based on
cross-sectional data, and reflects the scatter
of height values at a&nbsp;specific age.  Such Z&#8209;scores of the
reference population are not constant, however, but
actually increase linearly during childhood, thus
limiting the usefulness of HAZ to assess changes in
height over time.
<p></p>
Instead, Leroy et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Leroy, J. L., Ruel, M., Habicht, J. P., & Frongillo, E. A. (2014). Linear growth deficit continues to accumulate beyond the first 1000 days in low- and middle-income countries: global evidence from 51 national surveys. The Journal of nutrition, 144(9), 1460–1466.">

recom&shy;mend using height-for-age difference (HAD) to describe and compare
height changes as populations of children age.
Height-for-age difference is
defined as a&nbsp;child's height minus the
median height of the growth standard at that age,
expressed in centimeters.
Leroy and colleagues compared changes in height as
populations age based on absolute height-for-age differences
(HADs) and HAZs using data from 51&nbsp;nation&shy;wide surveys from low- and
middle-income countries

In this figure the mean HAZ started below the
WHO growth standard at approx&shy;imately &minus;0.4&nbsp;Z&#8209;scores
and fell steadily up to 24mo,
after which it stabilized and increased only slightly.
<p>
Based on the mean HAD curve, the children started
with an average height deficit of 0.8cm,
with the most pronounced faltering (i.e., steepest slope)
evident between 6&nbsp;and 18mo, as shown
for the HAZ curve. Nevertheless, in contrast
with the trend in the HAZ curve, the deficits in
linear growth depicted by the HAD curves continued
to increase after 18mo, albeit at a
lower rate than before 18mo. Indeed,
the slopes of the HAD curve provide no indication that
the process of growth faltering
leveled off even at 5y. The bumps noted in the curves just
after  24, 36, and 48mo are reportedly due to the tendency
to report age in completed years
rather than exact months

although the magnitude of the deficits varied

using height-for-age difference (HAD) to describe and compare
height changes as populations of children age.
Height-for-age difference is

<P></p>
<p>
Globally, 70% of the absolute deficit accumulated in
height (HAD) at 60mo could be
attrib&shy;uted to falter&shy;ing during the first &ldquo;1000&rdquo; days
(conception to 24mos), but 30% was due to
continued increases in deficit from age <span class="n">2&ndash;5y. </span>
However, such continued increases were masked
by the use of HAZ with the age-related changes in &nbsp;Z&#8209;scores.
These findings emphasize the importance of using the
mean HAD to provide an accurate assessment of
population-level catch-up in linear growth at all ages.

<h3 id="13.1.4">13.1.4   Percent-of-median</h3>

Growth indices can be expressed as percent-of-median value
of the reference data when the distri&shy;bution around the
median value is unknown. Percent-of-median is the ratio of
a&nbsp;measured anthro&shy;pometric value (e.g. weight) in the
individual, to the median value of the reference data for
the same age or height, expressed as a&nbsp;percentage. It is
especially useful when the distri&shy;bution of the reference data has not
been normalized, such as the earlier Harvard reference data, and
explains why so many of the first classification
schemes based on the Harvard reference data (e.g., Gomez and
Wellcome classifications) used percent-of-median

<span data-tippy-content="Gorstein, J., Sullivan, K., Yip, R., de&nbsp;Onís, M., Trowbridge, F., Fajans, P., & Clugston, G. (1994). Issues in the assessment of nutritional status using anthropometry. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 72(2), 273–283.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8205648/"
target="right" >Gorstein et&nbsp;al., 1994</a>).</span>
<p>
Use of percent-of-median does not provide
the same information as the Z&#8209;score, and the relation&shy;ship
between these two criteria differs with age and
height. Such discrepancies may be especially important if
inter&shy;vention activities are prioritized across populations
according to the preva&shy;lence of low
anthro&shy;pometric indices. A&nbsp;comparison of selected Z&#8209;scores
and percent-of-median curves for
weight-for-height, height-for-age, and weight-for-age is
given in Gorstein et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Gorstein, J., Sullivan, K., Yip, R., de&nbsp;Onís, M., Trowbridge, F., Fajans, P., & Clugston, G. (1994). Issues in the assessment of nutritional status using anthropometry. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 72(2), 273–283.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8205648/"
target="right" >1994</a>).</span>

<p>
A&nbsp;further limitation of the percent-of-median is that, unlike
per&shy;cent&shy;iles or Z&#8209;scores, the inter&shy;pretation of specific
percent-of-median varies across age groups and growth
indices
<a href="#table13.3">Table&nbsp;13.3</a>.
This arises because the
calculation of the percent-of-median does not take into account
the distri&shy;bution of the data within the reference set, and
particularly the differing widths of the distri&shy;butions of
the weight-for-age, weight-for-height, and height-for-age
indices

<span data-tippy-content="Waterlow, J. C., Buzina, R., Keller, W., Lane, J. M., Nichaman, M. Z., & Tanner, J. M. (1977).

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/304391/"
target="right" >Waterlow et&nbsp;al., 1977</a>).</span>

Indeed, it is this variability that inhibits the universal use of a&nbsp;constant
percentage of the reference median (e.g. 70%) across all
ages and for all growth indices. For example, 60% of median
weight-for-age represents a&nbsp;more severe state of
mal&shy;nut&shy;rition for younger than for older children.
Moreover, when the index weight-for-height is used, 60% of
the median is inappropriate; such a&nbsp;deficit at any age is
incompatible with life

length/height-for-age, and weight-for-length/height) are used
together with BMI for children age <span class="n">0&ndash;19y</span>,
all expressed as either per&shy;cent&shy;iles

Accurate measure&shy;ments of weight and length or height on each child are
needed. WHO has developed an
Anthro&shy;pometry Training Video which can be
downloaded from WHO.
<!-- www.who.int/childgrowth/training/en/-->
Box&nbsp;13.3 summarizes some of the points emphasized by WHO to
ensure the collection of accurate growth data.

<div class="box">
<b>Box&nbsp;13.3 Points to consider to ensure accurate growth measure&shy;ments</b>
<ul>
<li>Make sure all equip&shy;ment is correctly calibrated on a&nbsp;regular basis.</li>
<li>Conduct training based on recom&shy;mended
measure&shy;ment protocols as well as standardization
sessions for those who collect the data.</li>
<li>Take the child's date of birth from a&nbsp;written record if available.
Otherwise ask for both the
child's date of birth and age on the day measured,
since the year of birth is frequently reported
incorrectly. If birth dates are not recorded or known with
certainty, probe the caregiver for the
approx&shy;imate date of birth based on a&nbsp;local events calendar.</li>
<li>If WHO AnthroPlus is used, the software calculates the precise
age, depending on the age of
the child in days (for those aged <span class="n">0&ndash;60mos)</span> or
months (for those aged <span class="n">5&ndash;19y)</span>.  Alternatively,
secure the WHO child age calculator consisting
of a&nbsp;rotating disk mounted on a&nbsp;calendar in polyvinyl chloride film,
if attending a&nbsp;training workshop in a&nbsp;regional WHO Regional Office.</li>
<li>Measure and record recumbent length in children younger than 24mo
or standing height from 24mo onwards, where possible.
There is a&nbsp;0.7cm difference between length and
height.  If a&nbsp;child older than 2y is measured lying down
instead of standing, then 0.7cm is subtracted by the
software to derive an estimated height.
Alternatively, if a&nbsp;child younger than 24mo is
measured standing, then 0.7cm is added by the
software to derive an estimated length.</li>
<li>Record whether the child has edema or not before
measuring the child's weight: edema is a&nbsp;clinical
sign of severe under&shy;nutrition that can mask
a&nbsp;very low weight. To check for the presence
of edema, grasp the child's foot so that it rests in your hands
with your thumb on top of the foot. Press
the thumb down gently for a&nbsp;few seconds.
If a&nbsp;pit (dent) remains in the foot after lifting your thumb,
then the child has edema. No weight measure&shy;ment
should be taken if edema is present.</li>
<li>Once the data on age, sex, weight, and length/height
have been recorded, check the results and if the child
appears to have extreme Z&#8209;score values, the child
should be re-measured immediately. Note: calculating the
 Z&#8209;score values before proceeding with
 the measure&shy;ment of the next subject is good practice.

 <h3 id="13.2.2">13.2.2   Screening to identify abnormal changes in growth</h3>

In general, to identify abnormal changes in growth, measure&shy;ments
in a&nbsp;child should be repeated at monthly intervals
during the first 6mo, then every <span class="n">2&ndash;3mo</span>
during later infancy and early childhood, and then every
<span class="n">6&ndash;12mo</span>

<p>
Such serial measure&shy;ments provide information on the pattern
of growth over time. This enables a&nbsp;child with failure to
thrive to be identified. Abnormal growth is apparent from
the direction of the growth curve: an abnormal
height-for-age growth curve is horizontal or, in the case of
weight-for-height, moves downwards. The former indicates
that the child is not growing, and the latter shows that the
child is losing weight. Such a trend may indicate that the child
has been ill. Alternatively, the trend may be desirable
if the child is over&shy;weight.

</figcaption>
</figure>
depicts diagram&shy;matically the growth history of a&nbsp;7y&nbsp;girl
who was following a&nbsp;macrobiotic diet, and whose
growth, based on height-for-age, was measured and plotted
at least annually on a&nbsp;distance growth chart. Curves for
&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score, the median, and &plus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score for the growth reference
for height-for-age are shown. Growth indices that fall below
&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score or above &plus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score are defined as abnormal.
In <a href="#figure13.7">Figure&nbsp;13.7</a>
the child's height-for-age growth curve
fell below the &minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score reference at&nbsp;2y,
at which point the curve became nearly horizontal,
indicating that the child was growing very, very slowly.
<p>
When a&nbsp;child exhibits deceleration or slow growth of length
or height, as shown in
<a href="#figure13.7">Figure&nbsp;13.7</a>,
then the child must be evaluated to distinguish between a
shifting of linear growth, sometimes termed &ldquo;rechanneling&rdquo;,
constitutional growth delay, and under&shy;lying pathology. Any
shift in linear growth is determined by genetic influences,
and tends to occur within the first 18mos of life, when the
growth of an apparently healthy child may cross one or more
Z&#8209;score or per&shy;cent&shy;ile lines. In contrast, the exact cause of
constitutional growth delay is unknown.
It occurs later than rechanneling,
and is characterized by a&nbsp;temporary delay in skeletal growth
and height of a&nbsp;child, and is not accompanied by any other
physical abnormalities causing the delay. Alternatively,
slow growth can arise from many pathological conditions,
such as mal&shy;nut&shy;rition <a href="#figure13.7">(Figure&nbsp;13.7</a>),
chronic disease (e.g.,
tuberculosis), non-organic failure to thrive (caused by a
severe psychosocial disturbance in the family), or organic
disorders. The latter may encompass congenital and acquired
disorders, or abnormal function of the endocrine system or
metabolism, and gastrointestinal dysfunction (e.g.,
malabsorption); details are given in WHO

<p>
Although changes in a&nbsp;child's growth are apparent on
distance growth charts, abnormal changes in the rate of
growth of a&nbsp;child can be detected much earlier when growth
velocity charts, rather than distance growth
charts, are used: growth velocity measure&shy;ments are much more sensitive
to recent changes in growth but require careful measure&shy;ment
procedures to be of value. WHO has developed a&nbsp;set of growth velocity charts
which are recom&shy;mended for inter&shy;national use

<p>
The preva&shy;lence of over&shy;weight and obesity is increasing globally
in children younger than 5y,
and is an important contributor to diabetes and
other non&shy;communical diseases in later life.  The WHO
Child Growth Training Course provides
guidelines on how to investigate causes of
over&shy;weight and obesity in infants and
children <span class="n">0&ndash;6mo;</span> <span class="n">6mo&ndash;2y;</span> and <span class="n">2&ndash;5y.</span>
<p>
Trends in pediatric over&shy;weight and obesity in the
United States are an ongoing serious
health concern as about 17% of U.S.&nbsp;children and adolescents are obese.
In the U.S., the use of BMI in
association with the CDC (2000) BMI per&shy;cent&shy;iles
are recom&shy;mended by the U.S.&nbsp;Endocrine
Society to diagnose over&shy;weight or obesity in children and
adolescents &gt;&nbsp;2y. Over&shy;weight
is diagnosed in the U.S.&nbsp;if a&nbsp;child or
adolescent &gt;&nbsp;2y has a&nbsp;BMI &gt;&nbsp;85<sup>th</sup>
per&shy;cent&shy;ile but &lt;&nbsp;95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile for age,
as obese if the BMI is &gt;&nbsp;95<sup>th</sup>
per&shy;cent&shy;ile, and as extremely obese if the
BMI is &gt;&nbsp;120% of the 95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile
or &gt;&nbsp;35kg/m<sup>2</sup>


<span data-tippy-content="Styne, D. M., Arslanian, S. A., Connor, E. L., Farooqi, I. S., Murad, M. H., Silverstein, J. H., & Yanovski, J. A. (2017).

They recom&shy;mend calculating, plotting, and reviewing
a&nbsp;child's or adolescent's BMI per&shy;cent&shy;ile at least annually
during well-child and/or sick visits, and if a&nbsp;child
or adolescent has a&nbsp;BMI &gt;&nbsp;85<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cent&shy;ile, then
they should be evaluated for potential comorbidities.

<h3 id="13.2.3">13.2.3    Assessing response to therapy</h3>

Serial measure&shy;ments are also useful when
assessing the response to therapy, as shown
in <a href="#figure13.7">Figure&nbsp;13.7</a>;
again at least two anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ments are required.
Selection of the indicator of response to the therapy must
be made carefully. It must take into account the possible
time lag between the start of the inter&shy;vention and the time
when a&nbsp;response is apparent.
<p>
In the example shown in <a href="#figure13.7">Figure&nbsp;13.7</a>,
the child was enrolled in a&nbsp;2y
inter&shy;vention program because at age 2y the child's
length-for-age growth curve fell below the &minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score
reference, at which point the curve tended to flatten out,
indicating that the child was growing slowly. After 2&nbsp;years of treatment,
catch-up growth in response
to the therapy is clear, although the child did not approach the &minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score
reference until she was 4y.
<p></p>
An infant with severe acute
mal&shy;nut&shy;rition (SAM) is known to respond to a&nbsp;nutrition inter&shy;vention by first putting on
weight, only later &ldquo;catching&rdquo; up in linear growth.
Consequently, the recom&shy;mended discharge criteria
from a&nbsp;therapeutic feeding program for a&nbsp;child with
SAM
defined by a&nbsp;weight-for-height &lt;&nbsp;&minus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;score
(based on the WHO Child
Growth Standard) is when the child has reached a&nbsp;weight-for-height
above &minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score and no edema

<span data-tippy-content="WHO Child Growth Standards and the Identification of Severe Acute Malnutrition in Infants and Children: A Joint Statement by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund. (2009). World Health Organization.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24809116/"
target="right" >WHO/UNICEF, 2009</a>).</span>

These discharge criteria are based on the lower risks of mortality
compared to those children below &minus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;score, as shown in
<a href="#figure13.8">Figure&nbsp;13.8</a>.

<h2 id="13.3">13.3  Screening systems to identify individuals at risk in a population</h2>

Anthro&shy;pometry has a range of
applications that can be used at the population level.
Increasingly, screening systems are being used to map countries according
to levels of severity of mal&shy;nut&shy;rition

<span data-tippy-content="United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), World Health Organization, inter&shy;national Bank
for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank. (2021). Levels and trends in child malnutrition: key findings
of the 2021 edition of the joint child malnutrition estimates. Geneva: World Health Organization.">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240025257"
target="right" >UNICEF/WHO/World Bank, 2021</a>),</span>


and to identify priority countries for action. Screening systems
are also being used to monitor progress across countries in an effort to mobilize
countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
<p>
In public health, it is often not possible to obtain
serial measure&shy;ments on the same
individuals to identify abnormal changes in growth, as described in
the clinical setting in
<a href="#13.2.2">Section&nbsp;13.2.2</a>.
Instead,
screening systems are used to identify
individuals in a  population &ldquo;at&nbsp;risk&rdquo;
to mal&shy;nut&shy;rition and who may require
inter&shy;vention. Some screening systems are used only in
emergency settings, when low-cost portable equip&shy;ment
and the use of trained unskilled personnel are primary
considerations. In such circum&shy;stances, only one
anthropmetric measure&shy;ment (e.g., MUAC) may be taken.
All the systems use at
least one anthro&shy;pometric meaurement and one or more
reference limits drawn from appropriate reference
data.  In some cases, cutoff points based on functional impairment
or clinical signs of deficiency or mortality risk may be used.
<p>
An optimal screening
system is one in which no misclassification occurs;
all the individuals designated as &ldquo;at&nbsp;risk&rdquo; are
actually malnourished (i.e. there are no false positives;
sensitivity is 100%). Similarly, those
individuals classified as &ldquo;not&nbsp;at&nbsp;risk&rdquo; are truly unaffected
(i.e. there are no false negatives; specificity is 100%).
<p>
In practice, classification schemes are not perfect;
some misclassification will always occur so that some
individuals identified as &ldquo;at&nbsp;risk&rdquo; to mal&shy;nut&shy;rition will not
be truly malnourished (false positives), and others
classified as &ldquo;not&nbsp;at&nbsp;risk&rdquo; to mal&shy;nut&shy;rition will in fact be
malnourished (false negatives). Unfortunately, specificity
and sensitivity data for the anthro&shy;pometric indices
selected are usually not known for the target population.
Instead, when selecting a&nbsp;screening system, values for
sensitivity and specificity obtained elsewhere are often
used and assumed to be appropriate for
the target population

<p>
Unfortunately, literature values
for sensitivity and specificity are unlikely to apply to
the target population when the indices assess an outcome (e.g. low
birth weight) which is influenced by several biological
factors. For example, low birth weight can be due to both
prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation, and its
sensitivity as an indicator of neonatal mortality is greater
for the former than the latter

<p>
In many of the early
classification systems, cutoff points were defined as a&nbsp;designated
percentage of the median of the reference population, for the reason
outlined earlier. Now the approach preferred by WHO
is to use reference limits based on Z&#8209;scores

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="WHO (World Health Organization). (1995). Physical Status.: The Use and Inter&shy;pretation of Anthropometry. Technical Report Series No. 854. World Health Organization, Geneva.">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241208546"
target="right" >WHO, 1995</a>). </span>

Examples of screening systems that use this approach
and are based on a&nbsp;single anthro&shy;pometric index or
a combination, and that can be
used to classify individuals in a population &ldquo;at&nbsp;risk&rdquo;
to mal&shy;nut&shy;rition are outlined below.

<h3 id="13.3.1">13.3.1    Use of weight-for-length/height for young children</h3>

As noted earlier, low weight-for-length/height is
described as &ldquo;thinness&rdquo;
and reflects a pathological process referred to as &ldquo;wasting&rdquo;.
It arises from a failure to gain sufficient weight relative to length
or height, or from losing weight. The preva&shy;lence of wasting
in a&nbsp;population is defined  as
the proportion of children with a&nbsp;Z&#8209;score for weight-for-length
or height less than &minus;2 (i.e., &lt;&nbsp;2SDs
below the age- and sex-specific
WHO reference mean). Wasting is said to represent acute
mal&shy;nut&shy;rition which should be treated with an
acute inter&shy;vention to reverse the wasting and prevent death.
The onset of wasting is often highly
seasonal with an&nbsp;onset that is fairly acute and often associated
with both changes in the food supply and the preva&shy;lence of infectious
diseases. The highest preva&shy;lence of low weight-for-length often occurs
during the postweaning period
<span class="n">(12&ndash;23mos)</span>

<p>
WHO further classify low weight-for-length/height as:&ldquo;moderate acute mal&shy;nut&shy;rition&rdquo; when the weight-for-length/height is between &minus;2
and &minus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;score,
and &ldquo;severe acute mal&shy;nut&shy;rition&rdquo; (SAM) if the
Z&#8209;score is below &minus;3 of the WHO Child
Growth Standards

target="right" >WHO/UNICEF, 2009</a>).</span>

Treatment of children with moderate acute mal&shy;nut&shy;rition involves
improving their existing diets by nutritional counseling
to ensure  consumption of nutrient-dense foods that
meet their additional needs for weight and length gain
and functional recovery. Only in settings where there is a high preva&shy;lence
of wasting or food insecurity at the community or household level
should food supple&shy;ments, usually fortified blended flours,
be provided

WHO recom&shy;mends that all children with SAM
who also have medical complications, severe edema, poor appetite,

As noted earlier, the WHO recom&shy;mended criterion used for discharge
when weight-for-height has been used as an admission
criterion is when weight-for-height
reaches &gt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score with no pitting edema

This discharge criterion is based on the lower risks of mortality compared
to those children below &minus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;score as shown in <a href="#figure13.8">Figure&nbsp;13.8</a>.
Percentage weight gain should no longer be used as a discharge criterion

Note that use of the new WHO Child Growth Standard in low income
countries has resulted in <span class="n">a&nbsp;2&ndash;4</span> times increase in
the number of infants and children falling
below &minus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;score compared to using the former
NCHS / WHO reference population published by WHO in 1983.
<p>
Over&shy;weight in young children is
becoming increasingly common, as noted earlier.
Although WHO defines any child as over&shy;weight with a
weight-for-length/height Z&#8209;score above &plus;2, and as obese with a
weight-for-length/height Z&#8209;score above &plus;3, increasingly BMI-for-age
Z&#8209;scores are being used to define risk of over&shy;weight,
over&shy;weight, and obesity in children.

<h3 id="13.3.2">13.3.2 Use of MUAC for children</h3>

Mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) is
used for screening individual children for targeting interventions
in the community when weight and stature
measure&shy;ments are impossible and the precise age
of the child is unknown. In such cases, a fixed cutoff point for MUAC
is often used. For example, to diagnose children
with SAM aged <span class="n">6&ndash;60mo</span>,
WHO

<span data-tippy-content="WHO Child Growth Standards and the Identification of Severe Acute Malnutrition in Infants and Children: A Joint Statement by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund. (2009). World Health Organization.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24809116/"
target="right" >2009</a>)</span>

 recom&shy;mends a&nbsp;fixed MUAC cut-off
point of 115mm as one of the independent criteria that can be used
by trained community health workers and community members.
This MUAC cutoff was chosen because children
with a&nbsp;MUAC less than
115mm were observed to have a&nbsp;highly elevated risk of death
compared to those with a&nbsp;MUAC above 115mm

<span data-tippy-content="Myatt, M., Khara, T., & Collins, S. (2006). A review of methods to detect cases of severely malnourished children in the community for their admission into community-based therapeutic care programs. Food and nutrition bulletin, 27(3 Suppl), S7–S23.">

In addition, the preva&shy;lence of SAM based on a&nbsp;MUAC cutoff of 115mm
and that defined by a&nbsp;weight-for-height
below &minus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;score based on the new WHO Child
Growth Standard is believed to be similar, based on an

To identify children in the community with
SAM for treatment, WHO recom&shy;mends the

bilateral pitting edema as the preferred dignostic criteria.
Provision to mothers of MUAC
tapes with a&nbsp;cut-off value of 115mm have
been used in an effort to detect mal&shy;nut&shy;rition
early before the onset of complications, and thus
reduce the need for inpatient treatment

<p>
The WHO recom&shy;mended discharge criteria from
treatment for children diagnosed with SAM
using the MUAC cutoff is based on a&nbsp;MUAC &gt;&nbsp;125mm
and no edema for at least 2wk.
If children have been admitted based
only on bilateral pitting edema,
then the criteria for discharge should be the one used in
programs. To avoid any relapse, children with
SAM who have been discharged from treatment
should be monitored periodically

<span data-tippy-content="Guideline: Updates on the Management of Severe Acute Malnutrition in Infants and Children. (2013). World Health Organization.">

Concerns have been raised over the use of the
MUAC cutoff alone as a&nbsp;prognostic indicator of
mortality. As an example, Grellety and Golden

<span data-tippy-content="Grellety, E., & Golden, M. H. (2018). Severely malnourished children with a low weight-for-height have a higher mortality than those with a low mid-upper-arm-circumference: I. Empirical data demonstrates Simpson's paradox. Nutrition journal, 17(1), 79.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30217205/"
target="right" >2018</a>)</span>

claim that up to 45% of SAM children at
high risk of death will not be identified
using this approach.  This finding was based on an
examination of the relative mortality rates of children
<span class="n">6&ndash;60mos</span>
who had SAM (n&equals;76,887)
classified by the three diagnostic criteria
depicted in <a href="#table13.5">Table&nbsp;13.5</a>.
Instead, these investigators urge
that the use of weight-for-height Z&#8209;scores
should be retained as an independent criterion for
diagnosis of SAM, and innovative methods
developed to identify  those children with a&nbsp;low
weight-for-height Z&#8209;score but not a&nbsp;low MUAC in community screening
programs.  In the interim,
they suggest that use of
both a&nbsp;weight-for-height &lt;&nbsp;&minus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;score and MUAC &lt;&nbsp;115mm
should be retained and used routinely as diagnostic criteria
for SAM in an effort to identify those
children who should receive treatment.
<p></p>
Use of a fixed cutoff assumes that MUAC is relatively independent of age
for children <span class="n">1&ndash;5y</span>


<span data-tippy-content="Burgess HJL, Burgess AP. (1969). A modified standard for mid upper arm
circumference in young children.  Journal of Tropical Pediatrics 15:  189&ndash;192. *** NOT ON MEDLINE ***">
(<a href="https://www.google.com/"
target="right" >Burgess and Burgess, 1969</a>).</span>

This assumption has been questionned by several investigators.
Data from both affluent and nonaffluent
populations show that MUAC is age dependent, resulting in
over-diagnosis of wasting among younger children and
under-diagnosis among older ones, when a&nbsp;fixed cutoff point
is used

<span data-tippy-content="de&nbsp;Onis, M., Yip, R., & Mei, Z. (1997). The development of MUAC-for-age reference data recom&shy;mended by a WHO Expert Committee. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 75(1), 11–18.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9141745/"
target="right" >de&nbsp;Onis et&nbsp;al., 1997</a>).</span>
In view of these concerns, WHO has developed MUAC-for-age
reference data for children <span class="n">6&ndash;60mo</span>
(<a href="#figure13.10">Figure&nbsp;13.10</a>).

The curves show important age-specific differences, as well as
significant sex-specific differences for boys and girls
&lt;&nbsp;24mo.   In the field, the use of MUAC-for-age reference
data is no more difficult than using weight-for-height, the conventional
index of wasting.

<h3 id="13.3.3">13.3.3   Use of MUAC and Calf Circumference for adults</h3>

The importance of adult under&shy;nut&shy;rition is becoming
increasingly recognized. Both the Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) and WHO have adopted BMI
to assess adult under&shy;nut&shy;rition and have defined cutoffs
grading the severity of low BMI in adults. However, in
emergency situations, measure&shy;ments of weight and height,
required to calculate BMI, are difficult to obtain from
severely emaciated individuals who often cannot stand
unaided. Therefore, MUAC and calf circumference,
&nbsp;measure&shy;ments that only require a
tape measure, have been investigated as a&nbsp;substitute for BMI.
<p>
Significant correlations between measure&shy;ments of MUAC and
BMI have been demonstrated in women of reproductive age

<span data-tippy-content="Khadivzadeh T. (2002). Mid upper arm and calf circumferences as indicators of nutritional status in women of reproductive age.

 and severely under-nourished adult populations from

<span data-tippy-content="Collins S. (1996). Using middle upper arm circumference to assess severe adult malnutrition during famine. JAMA, 276(5), 391–395.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8683818/"

Reports of positive associations between calf circumference
and BMI have been primarily reported in clinical settings and
mostly in the elderly

<span data-tippy-content="Aparecida Leandro-Merhi, V., Luiz Braga de Aquino, J.!, & Gonzaga Teixeira de Camargo, J. (2012).

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22323346/"
target="right" >Aparecida et&nbsp;al., 2012</a>).</span>

However, there is little known about the relation&shy;ships
between both MUAC and calf circumference (CC) and health outcomes in adults.
<p>
WHO has proposed universal cutoff values for MUAC of 22cm

for females and 23cm for males, and below 31cm for calf circumference
(for both sexes) to screen for under&shy;nutrition

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="WHO (World Health Organization). (1995). Physical Status.: The Use and Inter&shy;pretation of Anthropometry. Technical Report Series No. 854. World Health Organization, Geneva.">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241208546"
target="right" >WHO, 1995</a>). </span>

However, in view of the reported regional and ethnic variations
in body composition, these cutoff values may not be appropriate for
Asian populations who have a higher proportion of body fat
than other races (e.g., Caucasians and Africans)

<span data-tippy-content="Deurenberg, P., Yap, M., & van Staveren, W. A. (1998).

(see Chapter&nbsp;11).
<p>
As an example, in a study in northern Vietnam of
women of reproductive age (n&equals;4,981),
a higher MUAC cutoff (23.5cm) was used to screen for
under&shy;weight in comparison to the BMI.
This 23.5cm MUAC cutoff
had a sensitivity of 89.1%, a specificity of 71%, and a positive
predictive value of 84% when analyzed using ROC curves.
If the lower WHO cutoff (22cm) had been used,
many women at risk for under&shy;nutrition would have been
misclassified as healthy. By contrast, the calf circumference cutoff
proposed by WHO (31cm) was found to be appropriate,
although slightly less accurate than the MUAC cutoff for
predicting under&shy;weight

<span data-tippy-content="Nguyen, P., Ramakrishnan, U., Katz, B., Gonzalez-Casanova, I., Lowe, A. E., Nguyen, H., Pham, H., Truong, T., Nguyen, S., & Martorell, R. (2014).

More studies are needed
to examine the utility of MUAC and calf circumference
in predicting functional outcomes.
<p>
MUAC during pregnancy has also been
investigated as a&nbsp;screening tool for risk of
low birth weight and late fetal and infant mortality.
Maternal arm circumference is relatively
stable during pregnancy, so its measure&shy;ment is
independent of gestational age

is a strong predictor of maternal mortality

In contrast, calf circumference is not

advances, so calf circumference may be increased

that uses the WHO MUAC-for-height reference data.
Construction of two sticks, one for the boys
and one for girls, is recom&shy;mended.
<p>
The WHO-modified QUAC stick consists of a&nbsp;vertical stick,
about 150cm long and 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3cm in
cross-section. One face is marked from 0 at the bottom up to 145cm near the
top in 0.5cm increments. &nbsp;
On one adjacent face, the corresponding
reference values for the median &minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score of MUAC-for-height are
marked; the other face, adjacent to the height measure&shy;ments,
shows the values for median &minus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;score of the MUAC-for-height.
<p>
To use the QUAC stick, it is first placed firmly upright
on a&nbsp;platform against a&nbsp;vertical wall.
The child is then asked to stand straight
with his or her back against the height
measure. Next, the MUAC of the child is measured using
the technique described in Chapter&nbsp;11.
Then a&nbsp;note is made about whether the value is below that given on the &ldquo;median &minus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;score&rdquo; face
at the point on the stick marked by the child's height.
If the measure&shy;ments is below this value, the
child is noted as having a&nbsp;severe nutritional deficit;
if above and yet still below the appropriate
value on the &ldquo;median &minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score&rdquo;
face, the deficit is recorded as moderate. In this way, all
children are identified as having severe, moderate,
or no deficit. Note that the method
eliminates the necessity of recording both the height
and MUAC of the child for subsequent
comparison with reference data.
<p>
The performance of MUAC-for-height for screening was
evaluated using weight-for-age &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score
as the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; for
identifying malnourished children

Over the past few decades both low- and middle-income

Body mass index (BMI) is the most widely used index
of over&shy;weight and obesity in adults as well as children.
Body mass index is relatively
unbiased by height and generally correlates with
laboratory-based measures of adiposity in most
younger and older adults, as shown in
(<a href="#figure13.14">Figure&nbsp;13.14</a>).
<a id="figure13.14"></a>

<p>
WHO has recom&shy;mended the use of a graded classification of over&shy;weight and obesity to:
<ul>
<li>Compare weight status within and between populations
<li>Identify individuals and groups who are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality
<li>Identify priorities for inter&shy;vention at both the individual and community levels
<li>Allow interventions to be evaluated appropriately</li></ul>

WHO (2000) also recom&shy;mend that the optimum population mean BMI should be

to describe all individuals with BMI &ge;&nbsp;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>.  Individuals
with BMI from 25.0 to 29.9 are further termed &ldquo;pre-obese&rdquo;.
Three classes of obesity are defined based on BMI
cutoffs of 30,&nbsp;35, and 40kg/m<sup>2</sup>. This classification system
is not intended for use with pregnant and lactating women,
or persons &lt;&nbsp;18y.

<p>
Although WHO recom&shy;mends the universal use of
these cutoffs inter&shy;nationally

<span data-tippy-content="WHO Expert Consultation (2004). Appropriate body-mass index for Asian populations and its implications for policy and inter&shy;vention strategies. Lancet (London, England), 363(9403), 157–163.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14726171/"

nevertheless WHO recognized that a substantial proportion of Asians

cardiovascular disease with BMIs lower than the
existing WHO cutoff for over&shy;weight (i.e., &ge;&nbsp;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>).

However, WHO has not set a lower
cutoff for Asians in view of the evidence that the
risk appears to vary in different Asian populations.
Instead, WHO recom&shy;mends that a broad range of
BMI categories should be used for reporting the
preva&shy;lence of over&shy;weight in countries.
<p>
Several investigators have studied
the  deter&shy;minants of both under&shy;weight and over&shy;weight
in  low- and middle-income countries in an effort
to develop country-specific strategies to reduce or

Successive national DHS surveys have been used
to track the rates of change in the preva&shy;lence of
under&shy;weight and over&shy;weight in some countries.
As an example, based on a meta-analysis of data
on women of reproductive age from five
successive national DHS surveys in Bangladesh
from 1996 to 2011, the overall total preva&shy;lence of under&shy;weight
decreased from 47% to 24% over
this time period, whereas that of over&shy;weight
increased from 4% to 16%.
Moreover,
this shift in BMI from under&shy;weight to over&shy;weight
from 1996 to 2011 was most strongly associated
with urban residence, age, higher socioeconomic
status, and higher education attainment

 In a systematic review and meta-analysis
of 34 studies, pre-pregnancy under&shy;weight
(defined by a BMI &lt;&nbsp;18.5) contributed to a 32%
higher risk of preterm birth, while for over&shy;weight
women, the risk of preeclampsia and gestation
diabetes mellitus approx&shy;imately doubled, an
effect that was even greater among women with
pre-pregnancy obesity.  These adverse effects of
both under&shy;weight and over&shy;weight in the
preconception period on pregnancy outcomes are
likely to be amplified in adoles&shy;cents or women
with closely-spaced pregnancies and thus
depleted nutrient reserves. These findings emphasize the
importance of appropriate interventions to
optimize maternal BMI in the pre-conception
period

<h3 id="13.3.8">13.3.8 Composite Index of Anthro&shy;pometric Failure (CIAF)</h3>

The three conventional growth indices &mdash; weight-for-age, weight-for-height,
and height-for-age &mdash; are described in
<a href="#13.1">Section&nbsp;13.1</a>;
additional details are available in Chapter&nbsp;10.
Each index provides important information on different aspects of
under&shy;nutrition (e.g., chronic versus acute) and can be used
to select the most appropriate inter&shy;vention.
<p>
In many low income countries, weight-for-age is
the most commonly used growth index for children,
with the proportion under&shy;weight (i.e., weight-for-age Z&#8209;score
&lt;&nbsp;&minus;2) being used extensively globally
as a proxy indicator to monitor progress in
meeting the Millennium Development Goal to eradicate hunger.
However, as discussed earlier and in detail in Chapter&nbsp;10,
under&shy;weight can be caused by stunting or wasting or
a combination thereof and does not distinguish between them.
Therefore, under&shy;weight when used on its own does not
identify the sum of those children who are stunted and/or wasted,
and thus provides an under&shy;estimate of the overall magnitude of
under&shy;nutrition among children in the population.
This is unfortunate because for policy and planning
in a country, it is important to under&shy;stand the overall
scale of the problem of under&shy;nutrition to ensure sufficient
resources can be allocated.
<p></p>
Consequently, an alter&shy;native classification system &mdash;
termed the Composite Index of Anthro&shy;pometric Failure
(CIAF), has been developed by
<span data-tippy-content="Nandy, S., Svedberg, P. (2012). The Composite Index of Anthro&shy;pometric Failure (CIAF): An Alternative Indicator for Malnutrition in Young Children. In: Preedy V. (eds) Handbook of Anthropometry. Springer, New York, NY.">

The original CIAF provided an aggregate
measure to estimate the overall burden of under&shy;nutrition
based on children whose weight and height were
below the WHO Child Growth Standard.
<p>
Comparison of the percentage of children classified
as under&shy;nourished, based on the three conventional
growth indices, and the CIAF using the new WHO Child Growth
Standards for children under 5y have consistently
shown more under&shy;nourished children using the CIAF than
all the conventional indices

With the emergence of the dual burden of mal&shy;nut&shy;rition,
the original CIAF model of classification for under-nutrition is no longer sufficient.
This has led to the extension of
 the CIAF model include two
 new groups: &ldquo;stunted and over&shy;weight&rdquo;;
 and &ldquo;over&shy;weight only&rdquo;,
 as shown  in <a href="#table13.8">Table&nbsp;13.8</a>.
 In some studies, BMI&#8209;Z score has been used to define
 over&shy;weight instead of WHZ &gt;&nbsp;&plus;2&nbsp;SD, with the
 BMI&#8209;Z score cutoff varying according to
 the age group of the children

Three methods have been recom&shy;mended
by WHO to evaluate cross-sectional
anthro&shy;pometric data for use in public
health. These three methods are itemized in
Box&nbsp;13.6.
To calculate the preva&shy;lence estimates for
stunting and over&shy;weight based on national
population data, the reader is advised to
use the WHO tracking tool to set national
targets and monitor progress. Note wasting
is excluded from the tracking tool because
of its high short-term variability. See WHO
Global Target Tracking tool for more details.
However, these methods can also be
augmented with more complex statistical
techniques to identify the deter&shy;minants and
consequences of mal&shy;nut&shy;rition, and to set
targets and/or assess the response to
interventions, depending on the study
objectives.

As an alter&shy;native to only depicting a subset,
the mean Z&#8209;score and standard deviation
of the entire distri&shy;bution of  HAZ&#8209;scores can be calculated.
If the mean Z&#8209;score is significantly lower than
zero &mdash; the expected value for the reference
distri&shy;bution &mdash; then usually the entire distri&shy;bution has shifted downward
<a id="figure13.17"></a>
suggesting that most, if not all of the individuals, have been affected.
This can be confirmed by plotting the entire distri&shy;bution of the Z&#8209;scores
against the reference distri&shy;bution as shown in
<a href="#figure13.18">Figure&nbsp;13.18</a>.
Here all the children, with an overall mean Z&#8209;score of &minus;1.83,
were affected by some degree of linear growth
retardation and an inter&shy;vention is required for the entire community.
This is termed a &ldquo;population approach to targeting&rdquo;.  In contrast,
the stunted children, as defined by
HAZ &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2 were only a subset of those with linear growth retardation.

With the recognition that anomalies in the distri&shy;bution of abdominal fat
are as great a risk factor for disease as is excess body fat <i>per se,</i>
waist circumference is increasingly used
as a surrogate estimate of intra-abdominal fat content in adults, often in
combination with BMI as a surrogate indicator of obesity.
However, to date, the use of this combination in large scale
population studies is limited.
<a id="figure13.18"></a>
<p>
Adult cutoffs for waist circumference that vary by sex
and ethnicity have been
developed (M:&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;102cm, F:&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;88cm, WHO, 2000)
with lower cutoffs proposed for
Asians (M:&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;90cm, F:&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;80cm,

<h3 id="13.4.2">13.4.2    Identifying the deter&shy;minants and consequences of mal&shy;nut&shy;rition</h3>

The main direct deter&shy;minants
of mal&shy;nut&shy;rition are frequently dietary
intake and infection, both of which are affected by
under&shy;lying deter&shy;minants such as household socio&shy;economic conditions,
food security, education, health services,
or water, sanitation and hygiene (i.e., WASH).
Anthro&shy;pometric indices can be used
in conjunction with household and WASH data,
to examine factors associated
with mal&shy;nut&shy;rition as well as its consequences.
Anthro&shy;pometric indices are especially
useful in extreme acute situations such as famine,
as the deter&shy;minants of very high levels of wasting are
severe energy deficits. The latter can be confirmed
by a rapid reduction in the preva&shy;lence
of low weight-for-height following re-feeding.
<p>
In non-disaster situations, however, the causes of wasting,
stunting, or over&shy;weight are much more difficult to
identify because multiple factors may be involved, making it
important to collect information or measure all potential risk
factors. Aguayo et&nbsp;al.

investigated the deter&shy;minants
of stunting and poor linear growth in children
in the state of Maharashtra, India where
22.7% of children
<span class="n">0&ndash;23mos</span> were stunted,
of whom 7.4% were severely stunted. They used data from
the 2012 comprehensive nutrition survey which included
questionnaires focussed on the households, mothers,
and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices,
using the standardized IYCF indicators developed by WHO

<p>
In the state of Maharashtra, the mean HAZ was significantly
lower (&minus;1.74 vs. &minus;0.25) and the preva&shy;lence of stunting
significantly higher (40.5% vs. 9.2%) among children age
<span class="n">18&ndash;23mos</span> than among children age
<span class="n">0&ndash;5mos.</span>
Multivariate regression analyses suggested that the most consistent
deter&shy;minants of stunting and poor linear growth in these
Indian children &lt;&nbsp;23mos were birth&shy;weight and child
feeding, women's nutrition and status, and household
sanitation and poverty; for more specific details see Aguayo
et&nbsp;al.

In a more recent study, factors associated not only with stunting
but also with wasting and under&shy;weight, were each examined in
children aged
<span class="n">12&ndash;59mos</span> using Demographic and

<span class="n">(2007&ndash;2018)</span> from 35&nbsp;low- and

target="right" >Li et&nbsp;al., 2020</a>).</span>

The comparative importance
of both direct and under&shy;lying factors associated with anthro&shy;pometric
deficits were
investigated.  In most countries, irrespective of the anthro&shy;pometric indicator
applied, household socio-economic status (assessed by household wealth and maternal
education) and parental nutritional status (i.e., height and BMI) were the strongest
factors associated with anthro&shy;pometric under&shy;nutrition, consistent with findings
elsewhere

<span data-tippy-content="Li, Z., Li, M., Subramanian, S. V., & Lu, C. (2017). Assessing levels and trends of child health inequality in 88 developing countries: from 2000 to 2014. Global health action, 10(1), 1408385.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29228888/"
target="right" >Li et&nbsp;al., 2017</a>).</span>

Nevertheless, several other factors associated with anthropometric under&shy;nutrition
were also identified and were heterogeneous among countries.
These findings highlight the importance of under&shy;standing the under&shy;lying
mechanisms of child under&shy;nutrition
within a specific country prior to formulating
inter&shy;vention policies and programs to reduce child under&shy;nutrition.
<p>
Over&shy;weight and obesity in childhood is also of increasing public
health concern in both developed and developing countries, as noted
earlier.  Hence, identifying modifiable risk factors for child
over&shy;weight and obesity that can be targeted through public
health interventions is also important.
In a report of Kenyan preschool children between
<span class="n">3&ndash;5y</span>
(n&equals;1495) based on data from a nation-wide
Demographic Health Survey (DHS), Gewa


<span data-tippy-content="Gewa C. A. (2010). Childhood over&shy;weight and obesity among Kenyan pre-school children: association with maternal and early child nutritional factors. Public health nutrition, 13(4), 496–503.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19889248/"
target="right" >2010</a>)</span>

examined
the associations between childhood over&shy;weight and obesity
and selected maternal and child-related factors.  Maternal over&shy;weight
and obesity, higher levels of maternal education, being a
large or very large child at birth, and being stunted were
each associated with higher odds of over&shy;weight and obesity
among these Kenyan preschoolers. Some of these factors are
modifiable and could be targeted through appropriate public
health interventions. For more discussion, see Gewa

<span data-tippy-content="Gewa C. A. (2010). Childhood over&shy;weight and obesity among Kenyan pre-school children: association with maternal and early child nutritional factors. Public health nutrition, 13(4), 496–503.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19889248/"
target="right" >2010</a>).</span>
<p>
Nevertheless, the interpretation of such cross-sectional
data on the deter&shy;minants of stunting and
over&shy;weight is difficult. Anthropometry and the
data from the households, mothers, and young children are
collected at the same time during a cross-sectional survey,
whereas both stunting and over&shy;weight reflect
long-term cumulative influences which may have
existed for a long time before the households were surveyed.
<p>
Child stunting, wasting, under-weight or
over&shy;weight each have short- and long-term
health consequences which are well documented

The capacity of anthro&shy;pometric indicators to predict the risk
of these adverse health consequences has been the subject of
much research; it depends on several factors. These include
the indicator selected, the specific risk under question, the
age of the children, the baseline levels of the anthro&shy;pometric
deficit, and the health status in the study population at
baseline. The findings vary according to the study setting.
Nonetheless, information from these investigations is
important because they can promote the survival of
these &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; children through appropriate interventions.
<p>
Many settings in developing countries are characterized by
poverty, infections, and inadequate dietary intakes. As a result, children
may exhibit multiple anthro&shy;pometric deficits
simultaneously, which may amplify their risk for adverse health
outcomes such as morbidity or mortality. To address
this concern, the association between simultaneous
anthro&shy;pometric deficits and the risk of adverse health consequences
have been studied by some investigators.

showed children who were simultaneously wasted,
stunted, and under&shy;weight (i.e., Group&nbsp;D) had the highest risk
of both diarrhea and acute respiratory infection.
These findings suggest that children with multiple
anthro&shy;pometric failures are at a greater risk of morbidity and
more likely to come from poorer households, as reported elsewhere

However, because this was
a cross-sectional study with the morbidity cases recorded
before the anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ments were taken, the
possibility that the associations observed arose from reverse
causality (i.e., restricted growth could be due to previous
infection), cannot be ignored.

More studies are needed to establish whether there are
unique deter&shy;minants of multiple anthro&shy;pometric deficits, as
well as to identify the combination of anthro&shy;pometric
deficits  associated with the greatest risk of mortality. With
this knowledge, interventions could be targeted to the
subgroup of children who may benefit the most.

<h3 id="13.4.3">13.4.3 Targeting interventions</h3>

Anthropometry can be used as a screening tool to identify
the areas of greatest need (e.g., areas with a high preva&shy;lence of
stunting or wasting or multiple anthro&shy;pometric deficits) and, hence,
likely to gain the most benefit from any inter&shy;vention. WHO and
UNICEF have classified the severity of mal&shy;nut&shy;rition in young
children &lt;&nbsp;60mos into five categories based on the percentage
preva&shy;lence threshold of wasting, over&shy;weight, and stunting

The fifth threshold labeled &ldquo;very low&rdquo;  and of no public health concern
was included across all three indicators to reflect the expected
preva&shy;lence of 2.3% (rounded to 2.5%) below/above 2 SDs
from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standard. The higher four preva&shy;lence
thresholds are defined by multipliers of this &ldquo;very low&rdquo; level
rounded to 2.5%. Note that for wasting and over&shy;weight, the
thresholds are the same: &ldquo;very low&rdquo; (&lt;&nbsp;2.5%), &ldquo;low&rdquo; (&asymp;&nbsp;1&ndash;2 times
2.5%); and &ldquo;very high&rdquo; (&gt;&nbsp;&asymp;&nbsp;6 times 2.5%). For stunting, the new
thresholds are &ldquo;very low&rdquo; (&lt;&nbsp;2.5%); &ldquo;low &rdquo;(&asymp;&nbsp;1&ndash;4 times 2.5%);
&ldquo;medium&rdquo; (&asymp;&nbsp;4-8 times 2.5%); &ldquo;high&rdquo; (&asymp;&nbsp;8&ndash;12 times 2.5%) and
&ldquo;very high&rdquo;(&asymp;&nbsp;12 times 2.5%).
<p>
The number of countries in the different threshold categories for
wasting, over&shy;weight, and stunting, shown in
 <a href="#table13.14">Table&nbsp;13.14</a>,
is based on data accessed in&nbsp;2018
from the WHO Global Database  on Child Growth and
Malnutrition and drawn from nationally representative surveys in 134&nbsp;countries
of children &lt;&nbsp;5y.
<!--Available at: http://www.who.int/nutgrowthdb.-->
<p>
Comparison of the preva&shy;lence estimates for each
anthro&shy;pometric indicator can trigger countries to identify the
most appropriate inter&shy;vention program to achieve &ldquo;low&rdquo; or
&ldquo;very low&rdquo; preva&shy;lence threshold levels. For example, in
<a href="#table13.14">Table&nbsp;13.14</a>  ,
in the countries in which the preva&shy;lence of
stunting was &ldquo;very high&rdquo; (i.e., n&equals;44), inter&shy;vention activities
should focus on resolving factors associated with
stunting.  These often include increasing the availability of
food, and improving diet quality, hygiene, and potable water
supplies, as well as programs to prevent and treat infectious
diseases

<h3 id="13.4.4">13.4.4 Evaluating response to an inter&shy;vention </h3>

When using anthropometry to evaluate the performance of an
inter&shy;vention, at least two measure&shy;ments, taken before and after
the inter&shy;vention period, should be recorded, where feasible.  In
child growth monitoring and promotion programs, for example,
serial measure&shy;ments of weight, and sometimes length/height,
are taken on children attending child welfare clinics or
community health centres. These measure&shy;ments are then
plotted manually on distance growth charts, preferably those
developed by WHO (<a href="#figure13.3">Figure&nbsp;13.3</a>),
to provide information on the pattern of growth over time
and the response to the inter&shy;vention, where appropriate;
see
<a href="#13.2.2">Section&nbsp;13.2.2</a>
and
<a href="#13.2.3">Section&nbsp;13.2.3</a>
for more details.
When choosing an anthro&shy;pometric indicator to
monitor the response, the time lag between the start of the inter&shy;vention and
the time when a response can be anticipated must always be
considered. As noted in
<a href="#13.2.3">Section&nbsp;13.2.3</a>,
children who
are wasted, respond to a nutrition inter&shy;vention by gaining
weight first, only later catching up in linear growth. Hence,
plotting weight-for-length/height (if available) or weight-for-age on the
WHO Child Growth Standard distance chart would be appropriate.
<p>
For large scale public health programs, the purpose of an
evaluation is to influence decisions about the effectiveness of
the programs. These decisions may include to continue,
expand, modify, strengthen, or discontinue a program.

<b>Adequacy evaluation</b> is under&shy;taken when it is not feasible to include a
comparison or control group.
Instead, the inter&shy;vention is evaluated on the basis of
a cross-sectional survey in which the preva&shy;lence of abnormal
growth at a certain time-point is compared with the preva&shy;lence
of abnormal growth defined by a pre-established criterium of
adequacy.  This could include, for example,
the &ldquo;very low&rdquo; preva&shy;lence threshold
for abnormal growth shown for children under 5y in
<a href="#table13.10">Table&nbsp;13.10</a>.
Adequacy of the inter&shy;vention would be achieved if the
evaluation showed that the preva&shy;lence of stunting, for example,
at the time of the evaluation, was less than the pre-deter&shy;mined
&ldquo;very low&rdquo; preva&shy;lence threshold of 2.5%.
<p>
In an adequacy evaluation, program activities cannot be
causally linked to the observed changes. Nevertheless, the
adequacy evaluation may provide the necessary reassurance
that the expected goals of the program are being met, thus
ensuring the continued support for the program. Examples of
public health programs in which adequacy evaluation has
been applied include a 10&#8209;year Micronutrient and Health
(MICAH) program implemented from 1996&ndash;2005 in selected
areas of Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, and Tanzania by World
Vision

<p>
<b>Plausibility evaluation</b> is conducted when
decision makers require a greater degree of confidence that
the observed changes were indeed due to the program.
For an evaluation to be plausible, it must be
able to show that the inter&shy;vention appears to have an effect
above and beyond  other confounding factors which might
have caused the observed effects. Hence, although this design
does not require randomization of inter&shy;vention and control
activities to the comparison groups, nevertheless, attempts
must be made to control for the influence of possible
confounding factors. This can be achieved at the inter&shy;vention design stage
by the careful selection and matching of the comparison or control
groups before the evaluation is begun. Alternatively, the
influence of confounders or modifiers can be assessed
afterwards at the analysis stage, when stratification or
multivariate analyses can be used, provided information on potential
confounders or modifiers has been collected or measured

<p>
<b> Probability evaluation</b> designs
provide the highest level of confidence that the inter&shy;vention
caused the outcome, and are considered the gold standard
method. They require the use of a randomized, controlled,
double-blind design which aims to ensure there is only a small
known probability (usually &lt;&nbsp;0.05) that the observed difference
in the preva&shy;lence between the inter&shy;vention and control
communities (or individuals) is due to confounding, bias, or to
chance. With the double-blind randomization of the subjects to inter&shy;vention and
control groups, baseline differences between the
inter&shy;vention and control groups are minimal.

provides an example of the method used in a
probability evaluation design of Alive and Thrive.
This design is especially appropriate when evaluating
long-running programs, such as 6y for the Alive
and Thrive initiative. Note in particular that the inter&shy;vention and control groups
in this design are similar at baseline as a result of the randomization.
Over such a long time frame,
non-inter&shy;vention-related changes in under&shy;lying deter&shy;minants
of nutrition, such as income, food security, education, health
services, or water and sanitation may occur.
These may generate changes
in the control group during the duration of the inter&shy;vention
as shown in
<a href="#figure13.19">Figure&nbsp;13.19</a>, high&shy;lighting
the importance of a control group, without
which the true impact of the inter&shy;vention would have been over&shy;estimated.
<p>
In order to attribute the changes in the outcomes to the
inter&shy;ventions implemented, Alive and Thrive used the
difference-in-difference (DID) or double difference method.
This method compares the difference in changes in outcomes over time
between the inter&shy;vention and comparison groups to estimate
impact, and is said to yield a reliable attribution of
impact to an inter&shy;vention. For more details see White and Sabarwal

shows an example of a probability evaluation
based on a cluster-randomized controlled trial
that examined the effectiveness of a nutrition education
inter&shy;vention program in Peru.
The cohort of young children,
recruited at 6mos,
were from a poor periurban area.
The inter&shy;vention was delivered through the health services with
the aim to enhance the quality and coverage of nutrition
education programs. The primary outcome was growth, and the
impact of the inter&shy;vention program on anthro&shy;pometric indicators
was assessed using the &ldquo;difference-in-difference&rdquo; (DiD) approach
and is shown in <a href="#table13.15">Table&nbsp;13.15</a>.
Note that the growth differences were adjusted for
socio&shy;economic status, hygiene score, and birth&shy;weight, after accounting for cluster randomisation.
The adjusted mean changes in weight gain, length gain, and
Z&#8209;scores at 18mos were all significantly greater for the children
in the inter&shy;vention area than for those in the control area. In
addition, children in the inter&shy;vention group were less likely to
be stunted at 18mos that those in the control group; see Penny et&nbsp;al.

for more details.
<p>
Abnormal changes in the rate of growth can be identified much
earlier when growth velocity instead of distance growth is
assessed, as noted previously
(<a href="#13.2.2">Section&nbsp;13.2.2</a>).
However, growth velocity can only be assessed in inter&shy;ventions when
the same children have been measured on more than
one occasion, as was performed in the study of Penny et&nbsp;al.

In this study in Peru, length velocity was very significantly
greater in the inter&shy;vention group than in the controls at 18mos.
<p>
For short-term inter&shy;ventions, assessment of weight gain or weight velocity
rather than length or height velocity is more appropriate
and easier to measure. As an
example, in a randomized controlled trial, Sie et&nbsp;al.

evaluated the effect of a 5-day course of three different antibiotics
(amoxicillin, azithromycin, and cotrimoxazole) on
growth among preschool children in Burkina Faso. Short-term
growth was assessed from weight and height measure&shy;ments
taken at baseline and 30 days following the last medication
dose from which weight velocity (g/kg/d), change in weight (g)
and height (in cm), together with WHZ, WAZ, and HAZ-
scores, were calculated. Results confirmed that children
randomized to amoxicillin gained significantly more weight,
had higher weight velocity and WHZ and WAZ&#8209;scores
compared to their placebo siblings, but there were no
differences in weight gain in those children randomised to
azithromycin or cotrimoxazole. Moreover, as expected, no
difference in height gain or HAZ were detected
over the 30day study period across any of
the study arms. These findings  highlighted that amoxicillin
may have short-term growth-promoting effects in children in
settings with a high preva&shy;lence of under&shy;nutrition and child
mortality.

<h3 id="13.4.5">13.4.5 Nutritional surveillance </h3>

The overall purpose of a nutritional surveillance program is to gather, interpret,
and disseminate information about nutrition. WHO

defines nutritional surveillance as:
<blockquote>
The continuous monitoring of
the physical status of a population, based on repeated surveys
or on data from child health or growth-monitoring programs.

The nutrition information collected can be used
to achieve the objectives shown in Box&nbsp;13.9.

The U.S.&nbsp;has conducted a comprehensive national
surveillance system since 1959 on the health status of
US&nbsp;residents as part of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES). Data on anthropometry,
demographic and socioeconomic status, dietary and
health-related measures are collected.
<p>
The U.K.&nbsp;also has a
surveillance system designed to assess the food consumption,
nutrient intakes and nutritional status of the general
population 18mos and older living in private
households. The system is termed the
<span data-tippy-content="National Diet and
Nutrition Survey Rolling Program">
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey"

and began in 2008.
<p>
Successive national DHS surveys have also been
used to track the rates of change in the preva&shy;lence
of stunting, under&shy;weight, and over&shy;weight in some countries.
As noted earlier
(<a href="#13.3.7">Section&nbsp;13.3.7</a>),
in a meta-analysis of
data on women of reproductive age
from five successive national DHS surveys in
Bangladesh from 1996 to 2011, the preva&shy;lence of
under&shy;weight was reported to decrease from
47% to 24% over this time period, whereas that
of over&shy;weight increased from 4% to 16%
(<a href="#figure13.16">Figure&nbsp;13.16</a>).
This shift in BMI from under&shy;weight
to over&shy;weight from 1996 to 2011 was most strongly and positively
associated with urban residence, age, higher
socioeconomic status, and higher education attainment

Recently, WHO has provided countries with tools to develop
or strengthen their surveillance systems so they have the
national capacity to monitor changes in the global nutrition target
indicators shown in Box&nbsp;13.2.
These indicators focus
specifically on childhood stunting, anemia in women of
reproductive age, low birth&shy;weight, over&shy;weight, and exclusive
breastfeeding.
<p>
The tools developed by WHO/UNICEF include the provision of
six policy briefs, each covering one of the global targets
with details of the actions that should be prioritized to meet the
global target. In addition, a web-based tracking tool
has also been developed to assist countries
to set national targets and chart
their progress of achieving the six global goals.
Details of the indicators recom&shy;mended to monitor each
target are available from WHO

The rising global burden of chronic, non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) has also led WHO  to adopt a Global Monitoring Framework
that includes 25 key indicators to track progress in the
prevention and control of NCDs.
This initiative prompted WHO in 2002 to develop
a stepwise approach to NCD surveillance (STEPS)

<span data-tippy-content="World Health Organization. Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health Cluster. (‎2005)‎. WHO STEPS surveillance manual : the WHO STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance / Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health, World Health Organization. World Health Organization.">
(<a href="https://www3.paho.org/english/ad/dpc/nc/panam-steps-manual.pdf"
target="right" >WHO STEPS Surveillance Manual, 2005</a>).</span>

The approach involves a standardized but flexible framework
for countries to monitor the main NCD risk factors
based on national household surveys of adults aged 18 to 69y,
preferably repeated every 3 to 5 years.
<p>
In step 1 of this approach, self-reported information
on demographics and behavioral risk factors are collected through
in-home interviewer-administered questionnaires. This is
followed by step 2 in which physical measure&shy;ments of
height and weight (to calculate BMI),
waist circumference, and blood pressure are under&shy;taken.
Step 3
is performed at a local clinic or health center for
biochemical assessment for blood glucose, blood lipids,
and urinary sodium

<p>
Since 2009, WHO has introduced eSTEPS for the data collection
which has led to a more streamlined and standardized approach
to quality control. WHO also provides technical support through
training workshops for the implementation of STEPS,
as well as STEPS &ldquo;Data to Action&rdquo; workshops
to strengthen the in-country develop&shy;ment of national NCD
policies and programs.
<p></p>
Data generated through STEPS has been used in a number of projects.

 provided a systematic analysis of the global, regional, and
national preva&shy;lence of over&shy;weight and obesity in children and adults from
1980&ndash;2013. Globally, the proportion of children,
adoles&shy;cents, and adults with a BMI
indicative of over&shy;weight and obesity has
increased over this time period in both
developed and developing countries,
although for adult obesity the increase has
stabilized since 2006. Moreover, age and
sex-related differences in patterns of
adult over&shy;weight and obesity exist,
with men having higher rates than women in
developed countries in 2013, peaking
at &asymp;&nbsp;55y, whereas in developing
countries, rates are higher in women than men, peaking at &asymp;&nbsp;45y
(<a href="#figure13.20">Figure&nbsp;13.20</a>).
<a id="figure13.20"></a>
Nevertheless, the levels of over&shy;weight
and obesity for both men and women in developing
countries continues to be lower than that of developed countries.
<p>
There has been a concerted effort over the past decade to
strengthen nutritional surveillance globally.
This effort is not only good
public health practice, but it has
also increased public and government
awareness of the extent of the problems of mal&shy;nut&shy;rition in both developing
and developed countries. Future develop&shy;ments in surveillance
may include methods that
quantify intra-abdominal and subcutaneous adipose tissue,
and measure physical activity patterns using wearable
technology, and assay hemoglobin A1c as an indicator of diabetes.
For more discussion of the challenges, limitations, and future
directions of STEPS, see Riley et&nbsp;al.

<p>
As noted in
<a href="#13.1.3">Section&nbsp;13.1.3</a>,
questions have been raised about
the validity of interpreting changes in HAZ scores across time
as representative of growth falter&shy;ing or catch-up growth.
Several studies have reported that HAZ scores
increased despite increasing height deficits, highlighting
that that the use HAZ scores rather than absolute height
differences from the median (HADs) may result in
opposite conclusions about the occurrence of
catch-up growth

<span data-tippy-content="Lundeen, E. A., Stein, A. D., Adair, L. S., Behrman, J. R., Bhargava, S. K., Dearden, K. A., Gigante, D., Norris, S. A., Richter, L. M., Fall, C. H., Martorell, R., Sachdev, H. S., Victora, C. G., & COHORTS Investigators (2014). Height-for-age z scores increase despite increasing height deficits among children in 5 developing countries. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 100(3), 821–825.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25008854/"
target="right" >Lundeen et&nbsp;al., 2014</a>).</span>

Hence caution is required when
defining catch-up growth. The authors recom&shy;mend
that absolute height differences should always be
included along with HAZ&#8209;scores when evaluating catch-up
growth in height in populations with a high preva&shy;lence of growth failure.
More research is needed to deter&shy;mine  which of the two metrics
is better at predicting different outcomes.
