Abstract</strong></p>
Body size can be assessed from measurements of stature (height or
length), weight, and head
circumference using stan&shy;dard&shy;ized procedures
described here.   When height cannot be measured, published equations
based on knee height, lower leg length, arm span or demi-span are used.
To interpret the measurements, indices such as weight-for-age,
body-mass-index-for-age, stature-for age, weight-for stature, and body
mass index (BMI, weight / height<sup>2</sup>) are constructed.
<p></p>
To evaluate the anthropometric indices, they can be compared with
appropriate growth reference data using Z&#8209;scores or per&shy;cent&shy;iles. For
international use, the WHO prescriptive Child Growth Standard for
children (0&ndash;5y) and the WHO growth reference for school-age children
and adolescents (5&ndash;19y) should be used. Statistically determined
reference limits or cutoffs can also be applied to generate
&ldquo;anthropometric indicators&rdquo; such as stunting
(stature-for-age &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score),
wasting (weight-for-stature
&lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score), over&shy;weight
(weight-for-stature &gt;&nbsp;&plus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score),
and thinness, over&shy;weight, and obesity
based on BMI-for-age &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2,&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&plus;2,
and &gt;&nbsp;&plus;3&nbsp;Z&#8209;scores, respectively.  Both
stature-for-age at &lt;&nbsp;&minus; Z&#8209;score and weight-for-stature at &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score
are recommended by WHO because together they can distinguish between
stunting and wasting. To assess changes in stature over time, however,
use of stature-for-age difference rather than stature-for-age Z&#8209;score
is now preferred.
<p></p>
To assess and compare the severity of malnutrition across countries,
five prevalence thresholds for wasting, over&shy;weight, and stunting can be
used. Recognition of an elevated mortality risk for children suffering
from multiple anthropometric deficits simultaneously has led to the
development of the Composite Index of Anthropometric Growth Failure
(CIAF). This is used to characterize the overall burden of under&#8209; and
&#8209;over-nutrition in children age  &lt;&nbsp;5y
so they can be identified and prioritized for intervention.
<p></p>
Changes in body weight over time are used in both clinical and public
health settings. In clinical settings lack of weight gain and weight
loss are used identify pediatric undernutrition, whereas weekly weight
gain is used to monitor response of children with severe acute
malnutrition (SAM)  to feeding programs. In public health, changes in
body weight over time are often monitored because of their increased
risk of mortality. New U.S guidelines for gestational weight gain are
now available which have been adopted by WHO for low-income populations
until specific country cutoffs are available.
<p></p>
BMI is currently the indicator of choice for defining under&shy;weight,
over&shy;weight, and obesity in adults and children.
However, the
limitations of BMI alone has led to the use of both BMI and waist
circumference because the distribution of abdominal visceral fat has an
even greater cardio&shy;metabolic risk than
excess body fat <i>per se.</i>
The BMI cutoffs
used to classify adults as
under&shy;weight (BMI &lt;&nbsp;18.5kg/m<sup>2</sup>), over&shy;weight
(BMI &gt;&nbsp;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and
obese (BMI &gt;&nbsp;30kg/m<sup>2</sup>) are based on adverse health
risks and sometimes risk of mortality. In adults, WHO recommends the
use of universal BMI cutoffs for over&shy;weight
(BMI &gt;&nbsp;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obesity
(BMI &gt;&nbsp;30kg/m<sup>2</sup>);
three classes of obesity are also defined.
This classification has
been adopted by several countries, including Canada and the United
States, with the highest class indicative of severe obesity (i.e., BMI
&gt;&nbsp;40kg/m<sup>2</sup>).
Cutoffs to define grades of low BMI values indicative of
under&shy;weight in adults are also recommended together with a
classification to identify populations with a public health problem.
Increasingly, low- and middle-income countries are impacted by both
under- and over-nutrition, a condition termed
the &ldquo;double burden of malnutrition&rdquo;.
<p></p>
In children, no simple cutoff to define thinness, over&shy;weight, or
obesity can be used because BMI has a characteristic curvilinear shape
with age. Instead, countries have compiled their own ways of defining
thinness, over&shy;weight, and obesity in children. Three classification
schemes are described with cutoffs
defined by BMI-for-age Z&#8209;scores or
per&shy;cent&shy;iles based on international or
national growth reference data.
They include those set by the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF),
the new WHO classification based on their international growth standard
and growth reference, and the U.S classification based on the 2000
CDC growth charts. Clearly, there is an urgent need for consensus on
BMI cutoffs for thinness, over&shy;weight, and obesity in
childhood that are
defined by adverse health risks. Only in this way can valid
international comparisons across countries on the prevalence of
thinness, over&shy;weight, and obesity in childhood be made.

<h2 id="10.0">10.0 Anthro&shy;pometric assess&shy;ment of body size</h2>

The most widely used anthro&shy;pometric
measure&shy;ments of body size are those of stature
(height or length) and body weight. These
measure&shy;ments can be made quickly and easily
and, with care and training, accurately. Head
circum&shy;ference measure&shy;ments are often taken in
associ&shy;ation with stature. Details of stan&shy;dard&shy;ized
proce&shy;dures for these measure&shy;ments of body size
are summarized below and are given in detail in

<p></p>
Indices such as head-circum&shy;ference-for-age,
weight-for-age, weight-for-stature, and stature-for-age
and the ratio of weight to stature are derived
from these measure&shy;ments. Of these, stature-for-age
and weight-for-stature have been
recom&shy;mended by the World Health Organization

for use in low-income countries.
In combi&shy;nation, they can distin&shy;guish between
stunting and wasting. There is also recognition
that indi&shy;vidual chil&shy;dren may be simul&shy;taneously
wasted and stunted, which has prompted interest
in ident&shy;ifying the combi&shy;nation of anthro&shy;pometric
deficits with the greatest risk of mortality

<p></p>
In epidemiological studies body mass index (BMI)
(wt/ht<sup>2</sup>, as kg/m<sup>2</sup>) is used to define
thinness, over&shy;weight,
and obesity. Increas&shy;ingly, BMI is accompanied by waist
circum&shy;ference to provide an assess&shy;ment of
abdom&shy;inal fat in chil&shy;dren, adoles&shy;cents, and adults.
In hospital settings, anthro&shy;pometric indices of
body size are used primarily to identify under- or
over-nutrition and obesity, and to monitor changes
after a nutrition intervention.

<h2 id="10.1">10.1 Measure&shy;ments of body size</h2>

Of the various measure&shy;ments of body size, head
circum&shy;ference is impor&shy;tant because it is closely
related to brain size. It is often used with other
measure&shy;ments to detect the pathological
conditions asso&shy;ciated with either an unusually
large (macro&shy;cephalic) or small (micro&shy;cephalic) head.
<p></p>
Recum&shy;bent length is measured in infants and
chil&shy;dren &lt;&nbsp;2y. Height is mea&shy;sured in older
chil&shy;dren and adults. The inter&shy;pretation of
length (and weight) at birth and during later infancy requires a
valid and precise estimate of gesta&shy;tional age:
making such an estimate is often difficult in many
low-income countries. To assess growth over short time periods,
lower-leg length in infants and children can be mea&shy;sured.  In adults,
knee-height measure&shy;ments are used to estimate
height in those persons with severe spinal
curvature and in those who are unable to stand.
Alterna&shy;tively, arm span or demi-arm span can be
mea&shy;sured when actual height cannot be performed.
<p></p>
Weight in infants and young chil&shy;dren can be
measured using a suspended scale and a weighing
sling, or for greater precision (within 10g), a
pediatric scale. For older chil&shy;dren and adults,
portable elec&shy;tronic digital scales with a taring
capacity are recom&shy;mended. Elbow breadth is used
as a measure of frame size, which is relatively
inde&shy;pen&shy;dent of adiposity and age

<h3 id="10.1.1">10.1.1 Head circum&shy;ference</h3>

For the measure&shy;ment of head circum&shy;ference, a
narrow, flexible, non-stretch tape made of
fiberglass or steel (range 0&ndash;200cm, cali&shy;brated to 1mm,
and about 0.7cm wide) should be used.
Any head-bands or hair-pins should be removed
and braids undone for the measure&shy;ment.
<p></p>
An infant or child below the age of two years
should be held on the mother's lap, whereas older
chil&shy;dren can stand with the left side facing the
measurer, with arms relaxed and legs apart. The
child must look straight ahead so the line of vision
is per&shy;pen&shy;dic&shy;ular to the body and the Frankfurt
plane &mdash; that is, an imaginary plane which passes
through the external auditory meatus (the small
flap of skin on the forward edge of the ear) and
over the top of the lower bone of the eye socket
immedi&shy;ately under the eye &mdash; is horizontal. The
tape is placed just above the supraorbital ridges
(i.e., slightly above the eye&shy;brows) covering the
most prominent part of the frontal bulge and over
the part of the occiput that gives the maximum
circum&shy;ference (i.e., fullest protuberance of the
skull at the back of the head)
<a href="#figure10.1">Figure&nbsp;10.1</a>.
Care must be taken to ensure that the tape is at the same
level on each side of the head and pulled tightly to
compress the hair and skin. Measure&shy;ments are
recorded to the last completed 1mm

Where possible, serial measure&shy;ments of head circum&shy;ference
should be incor&shy;porated into
routine well-child care, to establish if head
circum&shy;ference is within normal limits, too large
(mega&shy;cephaly), or too small (micro&shy;cephaly)

<h3 id="10.1.2">10.1.2 Gestational age</h3>

The assess&shy;ment of gesta&shy;tional age is necessary for
the inter&shy;pretation of any size-for-age measure&shy;ment
of infants and for following the
neurodevelop&shy;mental progress of preterm infants.
It is also essen&shy;tial for the management of
pregnancy and treat&shy;ment of the new&shy;born.
<p></p>
Several strategies are available for estimating
gesta&shy;tional age. Prenatal measures of gesta&shy;tional
age include calculating the number of completed
weeks since the beginning of the last men&shy;strual
period, prenatal ultra&shy;sonography, and clinical
methods. Of these, the definition of gesta&shy;tional
age on the basis of the last men&shy;strual period
(LMP) is most frequently used in low-income
countries, but it is asso&shy;ciated with several
problems: errors may occur because of irregular
menses, bleeding early in preg&shy;nancy, and
incor&shy;rect recall by mothers.

concluded that use of LMP for gesta&shy;tional
age dating during early preg&shy;nancy was not
sensitive in ident&shy;ifying late- and post-term
preg&shy;nan&shy;cies based on a compar&shy;ison of gesta&shy;tional
age estimates from LMP and ultra&shy;sonography.
<p></p>
Prenatal ultra&shy;sonography during the first or
second trimester is considered by many to be the
gold standard for assess&shy;ment of gesta&shy;tional age.
Estimates are based on different ultra&shy;sonic
measures of fetal size, with crown-rump length
considered the best single parameter for the first
trimester, whereas for a second- or third-tri&shy;mester
scan, a combi&shy;nation of multiple bio&shy;metric
parameters such as the bipari&shy;etal diameter, head
circum&shy;ference, femoral length, and abdom&shy;inal
circum&shy;ference are recom&shy;mended

popu&shy;lations from urban centers in eight countries
in which maternal health care and the nutritional
needs of women were met (Brazil, China, India,
Italy, Kenya, Oman, the UK and the USA). The objective was to
generate universal multi-ethnic growth standards
that represent how fetuses should
grow (i.e., the standards are prescriptive)
when nutritional, environmental, and health constraints on growth
are minimal. Fetal
growth charts for estimated fetal weight and
common ultra&shy;sound biometric measure&shy;ments

countries, and the quality of both the equipment
used and the tech&shy;nical training varies. Instead,
clinical methods of prenatal assess&shy;ment such as

For infants and chil&shy;dren &lt;&nbsp;2y (i.e.,
&lt;&nbsp;85cm), recum&shy;bent length is measured, preferably
using an infanto&shy;meter with a range of 30&ndash;110cm,
and preferably equipped with an elec&shy;tronic digital reader.   Recum&shy;bent
length should be recorded to the nearest millimeter,
or even more precisely (i.e.,&nbsp;0.1mm) when possible.

Two examiners are required to correctly
position the child and ensure accurate and reliable
measure&shy;ments of length. Prior to the
measure&shy;ment, braids must be undone and any hair
ornaments removed. Diapers must also be
removed so that both of the child's legs can be
outstretched in the correct position. The subject is
placed face upward, with the head toward the
fixed end of the board and the body parallel to the
board's axis. The shoulders should rest against the surface of
the board. One examiner applies gentle traction to
bring the crown of the child's head into contact
with the fixed headboard and positions the head
so that the Frankfurt plane is vertical

The second examiner holds the subject's feet, without shoes,
toes pointing directly upward, and keeping the
subject's knees straight, brings the movable
footboard to rest firmly against the heels. To
ensure the soles of the feet are flat on the
footboard, the examiner should run the tip of their
finger down the inside of the child's foot.  The
reading is taken to the nearest millimeter. If the
subject is restless, only the left leg should be
positioned for the measure&shy;ment. To encour&shy;age
and comfort the child during the measure&shy;ment, the
parent or guardian should stand between the
examiner and recorder so that they can make eye
contact and talk to the child during the
measure&shy;ment procedure.

Some investigators recom&shy;mend applying
gentle upward pressure to the mastoid processes
to stretch the spine and minimize effects produced by diurnal variation

Subjects are asked to take a deep breath and stand tall to
aid the straight&shy;ening of the spine. Shoulders
should be relaxed. The movable headboard is then
gently lowered until it touches the crown of the
head. The height measure&shy;ment is taken at
maximum inspiration, with the examiner's eyes
level with the headboard to avoid parallax errors.
Height is recorded to the nearest millimeter, or
even more precisely with more modern digital
equipment.
<p></p>
The time at which the measure&shy;ment is made
should be recorded; diurnal variations in height
occur due to compression of the spine as the day
progresses. Conse&shy;quently, for cross-sectional and
longitu&shy;dinal studies, heights should be measured
at the same time of day, preferably in the
afternoon. In cases where large amounts of
adipose tissue prevent the heels, buttocks, and
shoulders from simul&shy;taneously touching the wall,
subjects should simply be asked to stand erect
with the head in the Frankfurt plane.
<p></p>
In the field, vertical surfaces are not always
available. In such circum&shy;stances, modified tape
measures such as the Microtoise, which measure
up to 2m, can be used. To use the Microtoise, it is
first placed on the floor, after which the tape is
pulled out to its fullest extent and released, and
the end is fixed with a nail to a door or doorway.
The subject is then instructed to stand erect
directly below the point of attachment. An
anthro&shy;pometrist should position the subject's head
correctly in the Frankfurt plane, as described in
Section&nbsp;10.1.1, before the tape is lowered by a
second person until the head-bar touches the
crown of the head and compresses the hair. A
direct reading of height to the nearest millimeter
may then be obtained.
<p></p>
Recum&shy;bent length for a child of about 2y is
approximately 5mm greater on average than
standing height for the same child

<span data-tippy-content="Haschke, F., & van't Hof, M. A. (2000). Euro-Growth refer&shy;ences for length, weight, and body circum&shy;ferences. Euro-Growth Study Group. Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition, 31 Suppl 1, S14&ndash;S38.">

Hence, if standing height rather
than recum&shy;bent length is measured, 5mm must be
added to the standing height value when
recum&shy;bent length refer&shy;ence data are used. In
general self-reported heights tend to produce
slightly higher estimates of measured height, the
magnitude of the discrepancy varying depending
on age, race/ethnicity

When measuring recum&shy;bent length or standing
height, attempts should be made to minimize
measure&shy;ment errors. In longitu&shy;dinal studies involving
sequential measure&shy;ments on the same group of
indi&shy;viduals, it is preferable when&shy;ever possible, to have
one person carrying out the measure&shy;ments
throughout the study to eliminate between-examiner
errors. This is especially critical when growth velocity
is calculated; growth increments are generally small and
are asso&shy;ciated with two error terms, one on each
measure&shy;ment occasion. Recommen&shy;dations of the
minimal intervals necessary to provide reliable data
on growth increments during infancy and early
childhood

and adoles&shy;cence are available. In the WHO Multi&shy;centre
growth refer&shy;ence study (MGRS) for example, length
was measured every two weeks from aged 2&ndash;6&nbsp;weeks,
monthly for ages 2&ndash;12&nbsp;months, and every two&nbsp;months
for toddlers aged 14&ndash;24&nbsp;months.  Increments
measured over 6&nbsp;months are the minimum interval
that can be used to provide reliable data during adoles&shy;cence.
For shorter intervals, the
combined errors may be too large in relation to the
expected mean increment. Length or height velocity is
usually expressed as cm/y.
<p></p>
In large regional surveys, it is often necessary to
use several well-trained anthro&shy;pometrists. In such
circum&shy;stances, the anthro&shy;pometrists should be
rotated among the subjects to reduce the effect of
measure&shy;ment bias of the indi&shy;vidual examiners.
Further, regular standard&shy;ization sessions with the
assess&shy;ment of both within- and between-examiner
reliability throughout the data collection should be
conducted to maintain the quality of the
measure&shy;ments, and identify and correct systematic
errors in the measure&shy;ments; details of the procedures
used in the WHO MGRS are given in

The measure&shy;ment of knee height in chil&shy;dren is termed
&ldquo;knemometry&rdquo;. The measure&shy;ment is taken from the
distance between the heel and knee of the right leg
(i.e. the lower leg length) when the child is sitting.
At least three and preferably six measure&shy;ments are needed for an accurate

The main application of knemometry is for

units specializing in growth disorders. Knemometry
can also be used to assess the effect of thera&shy;peutic

By measuring knee height, growth increments in chil&shy;dren
are said to be detected more readily and over a
shorter time frame than by conven&shy;tional height
measure&shy;ments. Moreover, knee height
measure&shy;ments can be made with greater precision.
<p></p>
Several factors other than growth influence the
measure&shy;ment of lower leg length, and hence must be
controlled. For example, as diurnal variations
influence the measure&shy;ment, it is preferable for all
measure&shy;ments to be performed during the afternoon,
and by one trained operator.  Before the
measure&shy;ments, chil&shy;dren should avoid vigorous
physical activity for at least 2h, and instead,
stand or walk slowly for 5&ndash;10min.
<p></p>
To measure lower leg length in chil&shy;dren &gt;&nbsp;3y, the
chil&shy;dren must be able to sit quietly and co-operate.
The first knemometer  for measuring chil&shy;dren &gt;&nbsp;3y
was devel&shy;oped by Valk in 1971, and modified in 1983
to improve its accuracy.  Portable devices, termed a
knee height measuring devices (KHMDs), are now also
available for measuring changes in lower leg length in
chil&shy;dren &gt;&nbsp;3y

<p></p>
(<a href="#figure10.5">Figure&nbsp;10.5</a>) depicts the tech&shy;nique of lower leg
length measure&shy;ment using a modified Valk knemometer.
To take the measure&shy;ment, the
child is asked to sit on the chair. The sitting height
(A) and the chair back (B) and chair position can
be adjusted. The foot of the child is placed on the
foot rest (C) and the angle and the length of the
foot are recorded. The sitting position of the child
is stan&shy;dard&shy;ized by recording the following:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px; padding-left: 45%; ">
<li> sitting height of the child
<li> distance between the chair and the measuring board
<li> indi&shy;vidual sitting position of the child (i.e.,
distance between the lateral condyle (X) and the
back of the chair (B).
</ul>
<p></p>
Next, the measuring board (D) is lowered
onto the child's knee, and then the chair on which
the child is sitting is gently moved forward and
back&shy;ward. The knee is moved passively under the
measuring board (D) and the foot plate (C), while
the length is displayed continuously on an
elec&shy;tronic display. A counter&shy;weight (E) ensures a
constant pressure of the measuring board of about
200g.
<p></p>
The actual lower leg length is defined as the
maximum distance that can be reached during the
movements of the child's knee. The minimum
distance that can be discriminated by this
instrument is 0.1mm.
Chil&shy;dren should be lightly dressed
when these measure&shy;ments are taken.
<p></p>
<b>Portable knee height measure&shy;ment device (KHMD)</b>
<p></p>
The portable instrument is also designed
to measure short-term growth of the lower leg.
This device is less costly and easier to use than
the knemometer. Again, the measure&shy;ments are
taken while the child is sitting. The chair used
with this device should have a seat height of 33cm
and a seat length of 26cm.
<p></p>
The KHMD consists of a standard industrial
elec&shy;tronic height gauge (precision of 0.01mm) to
measure the distance between the knee and foot
plate. A plexiglass knee plate is mounted on the
height gauge. A dial indicator is attached to the
height gauge, so accurate and repeatable force can
be applied to the knee during each measure&shy;ment.
The reading on the dial indicator corresponds to
the torque flexion of the knee plate during the
measure&shy;ment.
<p></p>
The height gauge with the knee plate attached
is mounted on a base comprised of a foot plate,
wheels, and a handgrip to move the device. Both
heel and toe plates are mounted on the foot plate
to ensure that the position of the foot is
repro&shy;ducible for each measure&shy;ment. The knee is
also fixed in position during the measure&shy;ment by
an adjustable knee brace. The knee brace position
is recorded by the operator from a numerical scale
attached to the upright support. This allows the
operator to position the subject repro&shy;ducibly at
each measure&shy;ment session.
<p></p>
The position of the chair relative to the
KHMD must also be fixed for each subject at each
measure&shy;ment session. This is achieved by placing
the chair on a plexiglass grid with numbered and
lettered squares. This marked grid, together with
the braces for the knee, foot, and toe, ensure that
the position of the subject at each measure&shy;ment
session can be replicated

For the measure&shy;ment, subjects should sit with
buttocks and the small of the back firmly in
contact with the chair back, with the foot on the
foot plate flush with the heel brace. The top of the
knee brace is then adjusted until it has contact
with the nonboney space between the patella and
the tibial tuberosity. The chair is then pushed
forward so that the knee is in full contact with the
knee brace, with the leg centered in relation to the
knee plate. The opposite foot is positioned so it is
flush with the instrument and parallel with the
foot plate. Next, the knee plate is lowered onto the
top of the knee until it is deflected 0.03mm
(equivalent to about 2kg of pressure on the knee
which yields the smallest degree of error without
causing discomfort). The knee height
measure&shy;ment is elec&shy;tronically recorded. Subjects
should remain seated between measure&shy;ments but
remove their foot from the foot plate and then
return it again. The position of the child in the
chair and the foot on the foot plate should be
readjusted, and three additional indepen&shy;dent
measure&shy;ments should be taken.

The performance of the KHMD has been
compared with that of the Valk knemometer on
103&nbsp;chil&shy;dren 6&ndash;10y. Growth was measured at 28d
intervals with both devices. The within-examiner
error for the measure&shy;ments was 0.295mm for the
KHMD and 0.206mm for the knemometer. The
correlation between devices for measure&shy;ments of
growth rate on each child was 0.73 (p&lt;&nbsp;0.002)

Knee-height appears to be a valid index of linear

In general, the inexpensive electronic caliper has a lower TEM

The mini-knemometer contains a
commercially available elec&shy;tronic slide that
discriminates intervals of 10&micro;m. The slide is
connected to two measuring arms (A,&nbsp;B) with
metallic holders, as shown in
(<a href="#figure10.6">Figure&nbsp;10.6</a>).  The
infant's knee and heel are placed between the
holders. Knee and heel holders of different sizes
can be fitted, depending on the age of the infant.

When serial measure&shy;ments are being taken using
mini-knemometry, care must be observed to
ensure that the infant is always measured in the
same position. A spring mounted within the
instrument between the arms ensures a constant
soft tissue pressure between 2.0&nbsp;and&nbsp;3.0N. The
measure&shy;ment is painless for the infant and is best
made during breast-feeding. Measure&shy;ments should
be performed without refer&shy;ence to previous
recordings. Four&ndash;to&ndash;five indepen&shy;dent
measure&shy;ments of lower leg length should be taken
on each child within 1&ndash;3min, and both the mean
and standard deviation calculated. More readings are needed
when the child is restless.

<h3 id="10.1.7">10.1.7 Knee height in adults</h3>

Knee height is highly correlated with stature and
may be used to estimate height in persons with
severe spinal curvature or who are unable to
stand. Knee height is measured with a caliper
consisting of an adjustable measuring stick with a
blade attached to each end at a 90&deg; angle.
<p></p>
Recum&shy;bent knee height is measured on the
left leg, which is bent at the knee at a 90&deg; angle,
while the subject is in a supine position
(<a href="#figure10.7">Figure&nbsp;10.7</a>).
One of the blades is positioned under the
heel of the left foot and the other is placed over
the anterior surface of the left thigh above the
condyles of the femur and just proximal to the
patella. The shaft of the caliper is held parallel to
the shaft of the tibia, and gentle pressure is
applied to the blades of the caliper.

Some of the knee-height calipers are equipped
with a locking mech&shy;anism to retain the
measure&shy;ment after removing the caliper from the
leg. At least two successive measure&shy;ments should
be made, and they should agree within 5mm; the
mean is then calculated. Details for measuring
knee height in elderly persons seated in wheel
chairs are given in

compared the validity of 16&nbsp;equations to estimate height
based on knee-height in elderly nursing home
residents (n&equals;168) in Brazil. None of the equations
examined were applicable for the estimate of
height of indi&shy;viduals &gt;&nbsp;70y,
emphasizing that popu&shy;lation-specific equations
may be necessary. Conse&shy;quently, an assess&shy;ment
of stature based on knee height should be used
only for indi&shy;viduals for whom a direct
measure&shy;ment of stature is not possible, or is likely
to be inaccurate, because of vertebral flexions or
other skeletal deformities.

<h3 id="10.1.8">10.1.8 Arm span and demi-span</h3>

Arm span, like knee height, is also highly
correlated with stature and, hence, can be used as
an alter&shy;native measure&shy;ment when actual height
cannot be used such as in elderly persons when
degen&shy;erative and osteoporotic changes give rise to
spine curvature

calculation of body mass index (BMI) in older adults

and as a reliable surrogate of
both recum&shy;bent length and height in healthy
chil&shy;dren, when these measure&shy;ments are unobtainable or unreliable

<span data-tippy-content="Forman, M. R., Zhu, Y., Hernandez, L. M., Himes, J. H., Dong, Y., Danish, R. K., James, K. E., Caulfield, L. E., Kerver, J. M., Arab, L., Voss, P., Hale, D.

<p></p>
The measure&shy;ment of arm span is easier if
carried out against a flat wall
(<a href="#figure10.8">Figure&nbsp;10.8</a>), to
which is attached a fixed marker board at the zero
end of a horizontal scale. Sliding on the scale is a
vertical movable arm. The horizontal scale should
be positioned so that it is just above the shoulders
of the subject. Two examiners are needed to
measure arm span: one is at the fixed end of the
scale; the other positions the movable arm and
takes the readings. In elderly persons, an assistant
may be needed to support and maintain the arm
being assessed in a 90&deg; position

<span data-tippy-content="Silva de Lima, M., de Oliveira, L. P., Cabral, N., Liberalino, L., Bagni, U. V., de Lima, K. C., & Lyra, C. O. (2018). Estimating the height of elderly nursing home residents: Which equation to use?. PloS one, 13(10), e0205642.">

For the measure&shy;ment, the indi&shy;vidual should
stand with feet together, back against the wall,
with the arms extended laterally in contact with
the wall, and with the palms facing forward. The
arms should be kept at shoulder height and
outstretched maximally. The measure&shy;ment is
taken when the tip of the middle finger (excluding
the fingernail) of the right hand is kept in contact
with the fixed marker board, while the movable
arm is set at the tip of the middle finger
(excluding the fingernail) of the left hand. Two
readings are taken for each measure&shy;ment, which is
recorded to the nearest 1.0mm

group of elderly Chinese, for example, knee
height provided a more valid estimate of
maximum stature during early adulthood than arm span.
<p></p>
Instead of arm span, demi-span is some&shy;times
used to assess body mass index in older
adults when an actual height measure&shy;ment is not
possible. Demi-span is the distance between the
mid-point of the sternal notch (or jugular notch) &mdash;
a large visible dip in the
neck in humans between the clavicles &mdash; and the finger tips,
with the right arm outstretched laterally. The
measure&shy;ment is performed using a retractable
metal tape and taken to the nearest mm. Again, in
some elderly persons, an assistant may be needed
to support and maintain the arm being assessed in
a 90&deg; position

These equations are based on data for adults

However, as 98% of the sample were white,
whether the proposed equations are valid for other
ethnic groups is unknown.

In field surveys, a suspended scale and a weighing
sling may be used for weighing infants and
chil&shy;dren &lt;&nbsp;2y
(<a href="#figure10.9">Figure&nbsp;10.9</a>).
They should be weighed naked or with the minimum of clothing.
After slipping the subject into the sling, the
weight is recorded as soon as the indicator on the
scale has stabilized.

Alterna&shy;tively, for greater precision, a pediatric
scale (within 10g) with a pan may be used
(<a href="#figure10.10">Figure&nbsp;10.10A</a>).
Care must be taken to ensure that
the infant (preferably nude) is placed on the pan
scale so the weight is dis&shy;trib&shy;uted equally on each
side of the center of the pan. Once the infant is
lying quietly, weight is recorded to the nearest
10g. In cold weather, the infant can be wrapped in a
blanket of known weight, which is subtracted
after&shy;wards to obtain the weight of the child nude.
If the scale has a taring capacity, then the weight
of the blanket can be tared before placing the
infant on the pan scale.
<p></p>
If there is no alternative, the mother can be
weighed alone, and then again holding with the
child, using battery-operated precision digital
elec&shy;tronic weight scales. The child's weight can
then be calculated by subtraction. Alterna&shy;tively, if
the scale has a taring function, then the weight of
the mother can be set so the scale readout is zero,
enabling only the child's weight to be recorded. If
the child cannot be undressed, then standard light
clothing of known weight should be worn. This clothing weight
should be subtracted after&shy;wards from the child's weight.

<h3 id="10.1.10">10.1.10 Weight in older chil&shy;dren and adults</h3>

The measure&shy;ment of weight in older chil&shy;dren and

The weight scale should be placed on a hard,
flat surface (not carpet) and checked and adjusted
for zero-balance before each measure&shy;ment. The
subject should stand in the center of the platform
and look straight ahead, standing unassisted,
relaxed but still, and preferably nude. If nudity is
not possible, the subject can wear light
underclothing or a paper examination gown, and
the weight of these garments should be recorded
for later subtraction; standard corrections for
clothing should not be used. The presence of
visible edema should also be recorded. Body
weight should be recorded to the nearest 0.1kg.
Again, the time at which the measure&shy;ment is made
should be recorded because diurnal variations in
weight occur.
<p></p>
Elec&shy;tronic weight scales should be cali&shy;brated
with a set of standard weights over the full weight

Elbow breadth is a good measure of skeletal

Figure&nbsp;10.11. Measurement of elbow breadth.

</figure>

Elbow breadth is measured as the distance
between the epicondyles of the humerus. For the
measure&shy;ment, the right arm is raised to the
horizontal and the elbow is flexed to 90&deg;, with the
back of the hand facing the measurer
(<a href="#figure10.11">Figure&nbsp;10.11</a>).

The measurer then stands in front of the
subject and locates the lateral and medial
epicondyles of the humerus. The two blades of a
flat-bladed sliding caliper are applied to the
epicondyles, with the blades pointing upward to
bisect the right angle formed at the elbow. Care
must be taken to ensure that the caliper is held at a
slight angle to the epicondyles and that firm
pressure is exerted to minimize the influence of
soft tissue on the measure&shy;ment. The latter is taken
to the nearest millimeter

<h2 id="10.2">10.2 Growth indices, indicators, and recom&shy;mended growth refer&shy;ence data</h2>

The correct inter&shy;pretation and grouping of anthro&shy;pometric
measure&shy;ments require the use of anthro&shy;pometric indices

<span data-tippy-content="Physical status : the use of and interpretation of anthropometry , report of a WHO expert committee.
WHO technical report series ; 854">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241208546/"
target="right" >WHO, 1995a</a>)</span>.

They are usually calculated from two or more raw
anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ments. In the simplest case the indices are
numerical ratios such as
wt/ht<sup>2</sup> (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Combi&shy;nations
such as weight-for-age, length / height-for-age (i.e., stature-for-age),
and weight-for-stature are more complex. These latter growth
indices are not ratios and, to avoid confusion with numerical ratios,
should not be written as &ldquo;wt/age&rdquo;, &ldquo;ht/age&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;wt/height&rdquo;.
<p></p>
Anthro&shy;pometric indices are often evaluated by comparison with the
distri&shy;bution of appropriate refer&shy;ence data using standard deviation
scores (Z&#8209;scores) or per&shy;cent&shy;iles. From this, the
number and proportion of indi&shy;viduals (as&nbsp;%) with anthro&shy;pometric
indices below or above a pre&shy;deter&shy;mined
refer&shy;ence limit or cutoff
are often calculated. A commonly used statis&shy;tically defined
refer&shy;ence limit for the three main growth indices
is a Z&#8209;score of&nbsp;&minus;2
(i.e., 2SD below the WHO growth refer&shy;ence median). When used
in this way, the index and its asso&shy;ciated refer&shy;ence limit become an
&ldquo;indicator&rdquo;. Growth indicators are often used for public health or
socio-medical decision making at the popu&shy;lation level. They are
also used in clinical settings to identify indi&shy;viduals at risk of
malnu&shy;trition. Examples of frequently used anthro&shy;pometric growth
indicators and their corresponding application are shown in

preschool chil&shy;dren in the older NCHS growth refer&shy;ence.
<p></p>
The reported differ&shy;ences in the age patterns of growth
between the two growth charts, partic&shy;ularly during infancy, are
likely because the WHO standard represents the growth of only
term breast-fed infants who have greater weights for length than
the predominantly formula-fed Caucasian infants of the NCHS
refer&shy;ence,  although they do become thinner during the second year and beyond

based primarily on physical measure&shy;ments taken during five
nationally representative surveys conducted between 1963 and
1994, although some supple&shy;mental data were also used. During the
creation of these revised CDC&nbsp;2000 Growth Charts, two data sets
were excluded: growth data for very low birth&shy;weight (VLBW)
infants (&lt;&nbsp;1500g) whose growth differs from that of normal
birth&shy;weight infants, and weight data for chil&shy;dren &gt;&nbsp;6y who participated
in the NHANES&nbsp;III survey. The latter data were excluded from
both the revised weight and BMI growth charts because the
inclusion of these data shifted the upper per&shy;centile curves. With
the exclusion of these selected data, a modified growth refer&shy;ence
that is not a purely descriptive growth refer&shy;ence was created
because it does not contain representative national data for all vari&shy;ables

Additional factors that must be considered when selecting an index
or combi&shy;nation of indices to eval&shy;uate growth include the
avail&shy;ability of accurate measuring equipment, the training of
examiners to collect accurate inform&shy;ation and to interpret the
results correctly, and the time required to take the measure&shy;ments.
Finally, often over&shy;looked are the costs of not ident&shy;ifying
under&shy;nourished chil&shy;dren or incor&shy;rectly ident&shy;ifying adequately
nourished chil&shy;dren as under&shy;nourished

<h3 id="10.2.1">10.2.1 Head circum&shy;ference-for-age</h3>

Intrauterine growth retardation, or chronic malnu&shy;trition during the
first few months of life, may hinder brain develop&shy;ment and result
in an abnormally low head circum&shy;ference. Hence, head
circum&shy;ference is a widely used proxy of neural growth and brain
size. When brain size is outside of normal values, it is an impor&shy;tant
risk factor for cognitive and motor delay.
<p></p>
Head circum&shy;ference-for-age can be used as an index of
chronic malnu&shy;trition for chil&shy;dren &lt;&nbsp;2y
but is not sensitive to less extreme malnu&shy;trition

Beyond age&nbsp;2y, growth in
head circum&shy;ference is slow and its measure&shy;ment is no longer useful,

Certain non-nutritional factors,
including some diseases and pathological conditions (e.g.,
micro&shy;cephaly), genetic variation, and cultural practices such as
binding of the head during infancy, as well as a difficult or
forceps-assisted delivery at birth, may also influence head circum&shy;ference.
<p></p>
<b>Interpretive criteria</b>
<p></p>
Microcephaly in an infant is defined as a measure&shy;ment of head
circum&shy;ference that is more than 2SD below the mean of
an age- and sex-appropriate growth chart, whereas in severe micro&shy;cephaly,
head circum&shy;ference is more than 3SD below the mean

age was estimated using ultra&shy;sound. Hence, these multi-ethnic

<h3 id="10.2.2">10.2.2 Weight-for-age</h3>

Weight-for-age reflects body mass relative to chronological age.
Low weight-for-age is described as &ldquo;lightness&rdquo; and reflects a
pathological process referred to as &ldquo;under&shy;weight&rdquo;, arising from
gaining insufficient weight relative to age, or losing weight

<span data-tippy-content="Physical status : the use of and interpetation of anthropometry , report of a WHO expert committee.
WHO technical report series ; 854">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241208546/"
target="right" >WHO, 1995a</a>)</span>.

Because of its simplicity and the availability of scales in
most health centers in low- and middle-income countries,
weight-for-age is widely used in chil&shy;dren
from 6mo to 7y to assess under&shy;weight.
<p></p>
Under&shy;weight is defined by the indicator
weight-for-age &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score
(relative to the WHO Child Growth Standard) and was
selected as one of the indicators
to track the progress in addressing poverty and hunger for the
UN&nbsp;Millennium Develop&shy;ment Goals (MDGs).
These are now replaced by the
UN&nbsp;Sustainable Develop&shy;ment Goals (SDGs) (2015&ndash;2030),
which include the indicators to monitor progress shown in Box 10.2.
<p></p>
A major limitation of weight-for-age is that it is influenced by both the
height and weight of a child, making inter&shy;pretation difficult. For
example, weight-for-age fails to distin&shy;guish
tall thin chil&shy;dren  (i.e.,
those with low weight-for-height) from those who are short (i.e.,
low height-for-age) but with adequate weight. As a result, the use
of weight-for-age alone to estimate the preva&shy;lence of
under&shy;nutrition leads to a gross underestimate of the problem in
popu&shy;lations where the preva&shy;lence of low height-for-age (i.e., linear
growth retardation) is high but that of low weight-for-height (i.e.,
wasting) is low (e.g., Guatemala)

Conversely, in countries undergoing the nutrition transition and experiencing
progressive increases in childhood over&shy;weight and obesity, use of
weight-for-age alone will result in overstating their progress in
reducing under&shy;weight and mask stunting

<p></p>
To interpret any single measure&shy;ment of weight (or height) in
relation to the refer&shy;ence data, the exact age of the child at the date
of the measure&shy;ment must be calculated from the date of birth.
Software, such as WHO AnthroPlus, can calculate exact ages in
decimal fractions of a year, from birth and visit dates

Even when information on the date of birth is available, ages are
some&shy;times reported following rounding off the most recently attained

results in systematic errors

<p></p>
Birth&shy;weight is also measured in health centers in low-income
countries as well as maternity hospitals because it is an impor&shy;tant
indicator of fetal and neonatal health. Low birth&shy;weight (LBW) is
defined as &lt;&nbsp;2500g at birth, and very low birth&shy;weight as
&lt;&nbsp;1500g.
South Asia is a region where 25% of births are LBW, which is of
concern given that LBW infants are at risk of poor health and
develop&shy;ment outcomes.
Conse&shy;quently, as noted earlier, one of the
Global Nutrition Targets is to achieve a 30% reduction in low
birth&shy;weight by 2030  in recognition of the importance of LBW for
survival, develop&shy;ment and health in the lifespan

<span data-tippy-content="Global nutrition targets 2025: low birth weight policy brief, 30 December 2014">

<p></p>
Low birth&shy;weight may be a consequence of premature birth (i.e.,
before 37wks gestation), being intra&shy;uterine growth restricted (IUGR),
or both. To assess fetal growth restriction, the
weight of the new&shy;born is compared to the achievement of the
expected weight for a given gesta&shy;tional age.   Small for gesta&shy;tional
age (SGA), defined as being born below the 10<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile of a
sex-specific birth&shy;weight distri&shy;bution at a specified gesta&shy;tional age,
is often used as a proxy to iden&shy;tify IUGR neonates. Methods for
estimating gesta&shy;tional age have been described in Section&nbsp;10.1.2.

For inter&shy;national use, data for weight-for-age, expressed as

Differ&shy;ences in the prevalence of under&shy;weight  (i.e., weight-for-age

to the WHO standard and the older NCHS
refer&shy;ence have been reported based on the same dataset, as noted in
Section&nbsp;10.2.  Such differ&shy;ences have affected the ranking of
countries with respect to under&shy;weight. For example, using the
1996&ndash;1997 DHS survey from Bangladesh, the preva&shy;lence of
under&shy;weight was much higher (i.e., 2.5 times greater) during the
first six&nbsp;months but lower thereafter when based on the WHO

<h3 id="10.2.3">10.2.3 Weight-for-stature</h3>

Weight-for-stature, often referred to
as &ldquo;Weight-for-length/height&rdquo;,
measures body weight relative to length or height. Low weight-for-stature
in chil&shy;dren is described as &ldquo;thinness&rdquo; and reflects a
patho&shy;logical process referred to as &ldquo;wasting&rdquo;. It arises from a
failure to gain sufficient weight relative to stature or from losing
weight. High weight-for-stature in chil&shy;dren is termed &ldquo;over&shy;weight&rdquo;
and arises from gaining excess weight relative to length or height
or from gaining insufficient length or height relative to weight

<span data-tippy-content="Physical status : the use of and interpretation of anthropometry , report of a WHO expert committee.

(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241208546/"
target="right" >WHO, 1995a</a>)</span>.

<p></p>
The preva&shy;lence of wasting is defined as the proportion of chil&shy;dren
with a Z&#8209;score for weight-for-stature &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2
(i.e., below &minus;2SD from
the WHO median for weight-for-length/height). Wasting often
develops very rapidly, and is asso&shy;ciated with both changes in the
food supply and the preva&shy;lence of infectious diseases. Wasting can
be reversed quickly with an appropriate intervention. As a result,
weight-for-stature is the preferred anthro&shy;pometric index for
ident&shy;ifying young chil&shy;dren who are most likely to benefit from a
feeding program, or for evaluating the benefits of intervention
programs. It is more sensitive to changes in nutritional status than
stature-for-age.
<p></p>
A Z&#8209;score between &minus;2 and &minus;3 is often
defined as &ldquo;moderate acute malnu&shy;trition&rdquo;. Chil&shy;dren
with moderate acute malnu&shy;trition have
specific nutrient needs, details of which are available in
Golden

<span data-tippy-content="Golden M. H. (2009). Proposed recom&shy;mended nutrient densities for moderately malnourished chil&shy;dren. Food and nutrition bulletin, 30(3 Suppl), S267&ndash;S342.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/19998863/"
target="right" >2009</a>)</span>.

When the Z&#8209;score for weight-for-stature falls below &minus;3,
severe acute malnu&shy;trition (SAM) is present

<span data-tippy-content="World Health Organization & United Nations Chil&shy;dren's Fund (UNICEF) (2009).

Chil&shy;dren are some&shy;times discharged following treat&shy;ment for SAM
when weight-for-stature reaches a Z&#8209;score of &gt;&nbsp;&minus;2
relative to the WHO Child

This discharge criterion is based on the lower risk of
mortality reported compared to those chil&shy;dren with a Z&#8209;score
more negative than &minus;2.0.
<p></p>
In the past, the peak preva&shy;lence of wasting was said to occur in
chil&shy;dren at aged 12&ndash;23mos, triggered by inappropriate
complementary feeding and the depleting effects of infectious
diseases, partic&shy;ularly diarrhea

However, these early
studies were based on the use of the NCHS refer&shy;ence in which the
majority of the infants were formula-fed, with a different growth
pattern compared to their breast-fed counterparts, as noted earlier.
As a result, use of the new WHO Child Growth Standard based on
breast-fed infants has revealed an alarming level of wasting during
infancy, partic&shy;ularly in South Asian countries, a trend that was
masked when the earlier NCHS refer&shy;ence was applied, as shown in
<a href="#figure10.16">Figure&nbsp;10.16</a>.

<p></p>
As discussed earlier in Section&nbsp;10.2,
the striking differ&shy;ences in the preva&shy;lence of wasting are
likely due to the inclusion of only breast-fed infants in the WHO
sample, whereas the NCHS refer&shy;ence was based predominately on
formula-fed chil&shy;dren, as noted earlier (see Figure&nbsp;10.14).
Differ&shy;ences in the measure&shy;ment intervals used may also be a
factor.
<p></p>
Numerous preconceptual / prenatal and post&shy;natal factors have been
asso&shy;ciated with wasting. Of the preconceptual / prenatal factors,
short maternal stature, low BMI, and intra&shy;uterine growth restriction
are well recognized

Post&shy;natal attributable factors comprise poor infant and young child
feeding, recurrent infections, and small body size in early life.  In
some circum&shy;stances, household wealth and sub-optimal child care
practices have also been identified

target="right" >Martorell & Young, 2012</a>)</span>.
<p></p>
Seasonality is another factor influencing the preva&shy;lence of wasting.
Rates are often higher in the rainy season when staple foods stored
from the previous year's harvest may be depleted, morbidity is
increased, and there is greater participation by women in the labor
market

<span data-tippy-content="Hillbruner, C., & Egan, R. (2008). Seasonality, household food security, and nutritional status in Dinajpur, Bangladesh. Food and nutrition bulletin, 29(3), 221&ndash;231.">

WHO and UNICEF  have devel&shy;oped a screening
tool that includes five preva&shy;lence thresholds for wasting for
global monitoring and for ident&shy;ifying priority countries for action;
see Section&nbsp;10.2.6 for more discussion of this tool.
<p></p>
Studies using <i>in vivo</i> laboratory methods of body composition have shown
that wasting is asso&shy;ciated with major deficits in both the fat-free mass
and fat mass. The methods employed include deuterium dilution
(D<sub>2</sub>O), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), or bioelec&shy;trical
impedance analysis (BIA) (Chapter&nbsp;14). In severe wasting, the
extent of the decline in fat-free mass appears to be in proportion to
the severity of wasting, whereas the decline in fat mass is more
modest.  Moreover, following treat&shy;ment, although levels of fat may
recover, those of fat-free mass remain low in the longer-term even
following treat&shy;ment; this pattern is shown in
<a href="#figure10.17">Figure&nbsp;10.17</a>

(defined as weight-for-height &gt;&nbsp;2

WHO Child Growth Standards provide data for weight-for-length

However, during adoles&shy;cence, the weight-for-height relation&shy;ship changes
dramatically with age and also with maturational status. For this
reason, the WHO growth refer&shy;ence for school-age chil&shy;dren and
adoles&shy;cents 5&ndash;19y does not include weight-for-height refer&shy;ence
data.  Instead, they include BMI-for-age (5&ndash;19y) Z&#8209;scores and per&shy;cent&shy;iles

Note that increasingly, body mass index-for-age (BMI), expressed
as a Z&#8209;score or as a per&shy;centile, is being used to assess over&shy;weight
and obesity in both childhood (0&ndash;5y) and in school chil&shy;dren and
adoles&shy;cents (5&ndash;19y).
The BMI indicator is replacing the index weight-for-stature
used in the past to define over&shy;weight and obesity
in childhood (0&ndash;5y).
The WHO defines a child 0&ndash;5y as &ldquo;at risk of over&shy;weight&rdquo;
if BMI Z&#8209;score is &gt;&nbsp;&plus;1
and &lt;&nbsp;&plus;2; &ldquo;over&shy;weight&rdquo;

In contrast, based on the U.S.&nbsp;CDC&nbsp;2000 growth charts,
over&shy;weight in a child is defined as a BMI &gt;&nbsp;85<sup>th</sup>

a BMI &gt;&nbsp;95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile is indicative of obesity;
<p></p>
The CDC2000 BMI-for-age growth charts did not extend
beyond the 97<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile. With the increasing prevalence
of severe obesity in the United States, CDC has developed
new per&shy;centiles to monitor very high BMI values
by including data on children and adolescents from
1988&ndash;2016.  These extended BMI per&shy;centiles include the
95<sup>th</sup>, 98<sup>th</sup>, 99<sup>th</sup>, and 99.9<sup>th</sup> percentiles by age (2&ndash;20y) and sex

<h3 id="10.2.4">10.2.4 Length or height-for-age</h3>

Length or height-for-age (i.e., stature-for-age) is a measure of
achieved linear growth that can be used as an index of past
nutritional or health status. Recum&shy;bent length is measured in
infants and chil&shy;dren less than 2y, and height in older chil&shy;dren. Low
height-for-age is defined as &ldquo;shortness&rdquo; and reflects either a
normal variation or a pathological process involving failure to
reach linear growth potential. The outcome of the latter process is
the gaining of insufficient height relative to age and is referred to
as linear growth retar&shy;dation (or linear growth faltering)

The number of chil&shy;dren suffering from linear growth retardation is
much higher than the number of chil&shy;dren who are stunted

Stunting is defined as having a length or height-for-age
Z&#8209;score &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2SD based on the WHO Child Growth Standard for
chil&shy;dren age 0&ndash;5y

When the preva&shy;lence of stunting is greater than 40%,
it is considered a severe public health problem

In popu&shy;lations with a high preva&shy;lence of stunting,
usually the entire height distri&shy;bution has shifted down&shy;ward,
suggesting that most, if not all indi&shy;viduals, have been affected and
are not growing to their full potential. However, when the
preva&shy;lence is much lower and approximates the expected level
(i.e., &#126;&nbsp;2.5% of a healthy popu&shy;lation), then those with
low height-for-age are likely to be genetically short.

although the preva&shy;lence estimates for stunting do appear to be higher based
on the WHO Child Growth Standard compared to the older NCHS
refer&shy;ence data. The difference
is attrib&shy;uted to the tighter variability
of the WHO standards which affects the place&shy;ment of the usual

Unfortunately, in many low-income countries, length at birth or in
the neonatal period, is seldom reported because of the
difficulty of recording at the time of birth and the lack of the appropriate
equipment and measure&shy;ment training

As a result, assess&shy;ment of rates of linear growth retardation in many
low-income countries are often based on those for chil&shy;dren aged from
6&ndash;59mos, so the age of onset of growth failure is
uncertain.
<p></p>
In a recent longitu&shy;dinal birth cohort study, length
(n&equals;1197) was
measured shortly after birth (mean 7.7d post-delivery) in
7&nbsp;resource-poor settings in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Peru,
South Africa, and Tanzania; gesta&shy;tional age was not assessed

<span data-tippy-content="MAL&#8209;ED Network Investigators (2017). Childhood stunting in relation to the pre- and post&shy;natal environ&shy;ment during the first 2 years of life: The MAL-ED longitu&shy;dinal birth cohort study. PLoS medicine, 14(10), e1002408.">

Here, shortly after birth the preva&shy;lence of a
length-for-age Z&#8209;score below &minus;1 of
the WHO Child Growth Standard was 43% (range 37%&ndash;47%
across sites), and that of stunting (i.e., length-for-age Z&#8209;score
below &minus;2) 13% (range 10%&ndash;16% across sites).
<p></p>
It is of interest that in the MAL&#8209;ED longitu&shy;dinal birth cohort,
there was an almost uniform decrease in length-for-age with
age (except for Brazil), with the greatest increase in stunting
in all sites (except Brazil) occurring after 6mos. The
preva&shy;lence of stunting reached a plateau at about two years. Hence,
despite diverse cultures and geography, the patterns of stunting
with age were the same across study sites (except for Brazil), although
the magnitude differed, as shown in

The etiology of linear growth faltering is
multi&shy;factorial, and is asso&shy;ciated with many of the same prenatal
and post&shy;natal factors identified for wasting (Section&nbsp;10.2.3). For
example, in the MAL&#8209;ED longitu&shy;dinal birth cohort,
five factors were deter&shy;minants of linear growth falter&shy;ing
during early child&shy;hood: lower enrol&shy;ment weight, shorter maternal height,
higher prev&shy;al&shy;&shy;ence of entero&shy;pathogen detection,
lower socio&shy;economic status, and consum&shy;ption of a lower percent of energy
from protein in non-breast-milk foods

Interestingly, some of the predictors of stunting may not be the same as
those linked to the recovery from this condition. In the MAL&#8209;ED
longitu&shy;dinal cohort, the timing of stunting was
significantly asso&shy;ciated with
recovery from stunting. Their findings suggested chil&shy;dren who are stunted
at an older age have a higher chance of recov&shy;ering
from stunted growth than those children who are
stunted earlier, i.e, at age 6mos.

Identifying and preventing linear growth retardation or stunting during childhood
is impor&shy;tant because impaired linear growth results
in a reduction in adult size,
which, in turn, is causally linked with difficulties in child birth and poor
birth outcomes, notably increased risk of
low-birthweight infants

Delays in cognitive and motor develop&shy;ment in
childhood, reduced earnings in adulthood, and chronic diseases have also been
presented as con&shy;se&shy;quences of
linear growth retardation and stunting
during early childhood.
Based on the
current evidence, however, these outcomes
are unlikely to be causally related,
but instead correlates of linear growth retardation and stunting

Caution is needed when using BMI (and weight-for-height)
to examine associations between stunting
and body composition, given that height is incorporated
in the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of both stunting (HAZ) and BMI.

emphasizes that this will
generate an autocorrelation between short
stature and high BMI. Instead, it is preferable to measure adiposity directly using
such methods as bioelec&shy;trical impedance
analysis (BIA) or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
To date, whether stunting is casually associated with later adiposity
is unclear in view of the many method&shy;ologicall challenges that remain.

<b>Interpretive criteria</b>
<p></p>
The distri&shy;bution of height measure&shy;ments at a given age within most
popu&shy;lations is often narrow, so that accurate measuring tech&shy;niques
are essential. More&shy;over, a deficit in length takes some time to develop,
so assess&shy;ment of nutritional status based on
length-for-age alone may under&shy;estimate malnu&shy;trition in infants in some settings.

<h3 id="10.2.5">10.2.5 Height-for-age difference</h3>

Height-for-age Z&#8209;scores (HAZ) are widely used to assess
chil&shy;dren's attained height at a given age
(see Chapters&nbsp;9 and&nbsp;13 for more details on Z&#8209;scores)
However, some
investigators have used positive <i>changes</i> in attained mean height-for-age
Z&#8209;scores to identify popu&shy;lation-level catch-up growth in chil&shy;dren

have raised concern
over the appropriateness of using height-for-age Z&#8209;scores to
evaluate such changes in linear growth with age over time because
the cross-sectional standard deviations
used in the denominator of height-for-age Z&#8209;scores and shown in
Box&nbsp;10.3 are constructed from cross sectional data and are
not constant over time, but increase linearly from
birth to 5&nbsp;years of age. As a result, a child with a constant absolute
height deficit will appear to improve with age based on the HAZ.
Instead, Leroy et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Leroy, J. L., Ruel, M., Habicht, J. P., & Frongillo, E. A. (2014). Linear growth deficit continues to accumulate beyond the first 1000 days in low- and middle-income countries: global evidence from 51 national surveys. The Journal of nutrition, 144(9), 1460&ndash;1466.">

recom&shy;mend using height-for-age
difference (HAD) to describe and compare height changes as
popu&shy;lations of chil&shy;dren age. Height-for-age difference (in&nbsp;cm) is
defined as: child's height compared to standard, expressed in
centimeters. It is calculated by subtracting the sex- and
age-specific median height (from the WHO&nbsp;Child Growth
Standard) from the child's actual height as shown in Box&nbsp;10.3.

<div class="box">
<b>Box&nbsp;10.3 Height-for-age Z&#8209;scores (HAZ) and

<ul>
<li>
Growth deficits in height in groups of chil&shy;dren are expressed
as the mean of the indi&shy;vidual deficits. These are calculated as
the difference between the measured height
and the median age- and sex-specific
height from the 2006 WHO growth standard. This HAD can be
used in absolute terms or it can be used
stan&shy;dard&shy;ized by dividing HAD
by the SD from the growth standards to calculate HAZ:
  \[ \small \mbox{HAD &equals; observed height &minus; median height growth standard}\]
<p></p>
  \[ \small \mbox{HAZ &equals;}\frac {\mbox{observed height &minus; median height growth standard}}{\mbox{SD growth standard}}\]
Thus:
\[ \small \mbox{HAZ &equals;}\frac {\mbox{HAD}}{\mbox{SD}}\]
<li> HAZ is constructed using cross-sectional SDs. HAZ is useful to assess the attained height of chil&shy;dren at a given age but is inappropriate to assess changes in height as chil&shy;dren age; HAZ is thus inappropriate to assess catch-up growth in height

Note in the Figure&nbsp;10.20, the mean HAZ started below the WHO Child Growth
Standard (at approximately &minus;0.4 Z&#8209;scores) and fell markedly up to
24mos, after which it stabilized and increased only slightly. In
contrast, based on the mean HAD curve, the chil&shy;dren started with
an average height deficit of 0.8cm, with the most pronounced
faltering (i.e. steepest slope) evident between 6&ndash;18mos, as
shown for the HAZ curve. Nevertheless, in contrast with the trend
in the HAZ curve, the deficits in linear growth depicted by the
HAD curves continued to increase after 18mos to 60mos, although at a
lower rate than before 18mo. Indeed, the slopes of the HAD curves
provide no indication that the process of growth faltering leveled
off even at 5y. The bumps in the curves just after 24, 36, and 48mos are
reportedly due to the tendency to report age in completed
years rather than exact months

update the joint global and regional
estimates of malnutrition among chil&shy;dren
under 5&nbsp;years of age each year.
These estimates of prevalence and numbers
affected for child stunting, over&shy;weight,
wasting and severe wasting are derived
for the global population as well as by regional groupings of United Nations.
A new country-level model was used to
generate the country, regional and global
estimates for stunting and over&shy;weight,
for the 2021 edition and annual estimates
from 2000 to 2020 are newly available. These estimates do not account for the
impact of COVID-19, but the pandemic is expected to exacerbate all forms of
malnutrition.
This is likely due to worsening household income especially in vulnerable
populations, constraints in the availability and afford&shy;ability of nutritious food,
disruptions in essential nutrition services, and reduced physical activity.

Currently, the UNICEF/WHO/World-Bank classification scheme provides no
estimates on chil&shy;dren suffering simul&shy;taneously from multiple anthro&shy;pometric
deficits such as stunting plus wasting.
However, there is increasing recognition that
indi&shy;vidual chil&shy;dren may be at risk of both conditions simul&shy;taneously, might be
born with both, pass from one state to the other over time,
and accumulate risks to their
health and life through their combined effects.

Anthro&shy;pometric data comparing the per&shy;cent&shy;age of Indian chil&shy;dren classified as
under-nourished when based on one of the three conven&shy;tional growth indices and

As shown in <a href="#table10.3">Table&nbsp;10.3</a>,
the preva&shy;lence rate (as&nbsp;%) of under&shy;nutrition is
consistently less when only
one of the three conven&shy;tional indices is
employed, compared to the overall CIAF preva&shy;lence of&nbsp;48.2%
among chil&shy;dren &lt;&nbsp;5y.
Of these Indian chil&shy;dren, 19.1% had only one form of
anthro&shy;pometric failure (groups B,&nbsp;F&nbsp;and&nbsp;Y),
whereas 22.1% had two forms of
anthro&shy;pometric failure simul&shy;taneously (groups C&nbsp;and&nbsp;E),
and 6% had all three
forms of anthro&shy;pometric failures (Group&nbsp;D).
<p></p>
Nandy and Svedberg also argued that chil&shy;dren
who were simul&shy;taneously stunted, wasted, and
under&shy;weight were likely to be at the
greatest risk of mortality.  However, most of
the studies which have investigated risk of child
mortality using the CIAF model
to classify under-nutrition, have been cross-sectional

With the emergence of the dual burden of malnu&shy;trition,
the original CIA model of
classification for under-nutrition
is no longer sufficient.  This has led to the
exten&shy;sion of the CIAF model to include two new groups: &ldquo;stunting
and over-weight&rdquo; and &ldquo;over&shy;weight only&rdquo;,
as shown in <a href="#table10.4">Table&nbsp;10.4</a>.
Over&shy;weight is defined as

<h3 id="10.2.8">10.2.8 Weight changes</h3>

Body weight is the sum of the protein, fat,
water, and bone mass in the body.
Changes in body weight do not provide
any inform&shy;ation on the relative changes
among these components.
Increasingly changes in the components of body compos&shy;ition are
assessed using laboratory-based methods, such as dual-energy
X-ray absorp&shy;tiometry (DXA),
deuterium dilution, or bio&shy;elec&shy;trical
impedance analysis. For details of
these techniques, see Chapter&nbsp;14.
<p></p>
Body weight is the sum of the protein, fat,
water, and bone mass in the body. Changes
in body weight do not provide any information
on the relative changes among these
components. In normal adults, there is a
tendency for increased fat deposition with age,
concomitant with a reduction in muscle protein.
Such changes are not evident in body
weight measurements but can be seen by
determining either body fat or the fat-free
mass. In healthy persons, the daily variations
in body weight are generally small
(i.e., less than &pm;0.5kg). In conditions of
acute or chronic illness, however, negative
energy-nitrogen balance may occur as the
body can use endogenous sources of energy
(including protein) as fuel for metabolic reactions.
Consequently, body weight declines.
In conditions of total starvation, the maximal
weight loss is approximately 30% of initial
body weight, at which point death occurs.
In chronic semistarvation, body weight may
decrease to approximately 50%&ndash;60% of ideal
weight. In contrast, when persistent positive
energy balance occurs, there is an accumulation
of adipose tissue, and body weight increases.
<p></p>
Body weight can only be used to assess the
severity of under&shy;nutrition in subjects with relatively
uncom&shy;plicated, non&shy;edematous forms
of semi&shy;starvation

In disease conditions in which edema, ascites
(fluid in the abdominal cavity), dehydration,
diuresis, massive tumor growth, and
organomegaly occur, or in obese patients undergoing
rapid weight loss, body weight is
a poor measure of body energy-nitrogen reserves.
In such conditions, a relative increase
in total body water, for example, may mask
actual weight loss that results from losses of
fat or skeletal muscle. Massive tumor growth
may also mask losses of fat and muscle tissue,
which may occur during severe undernutrition.
Hence, additional anthropometric
measurements (e.g., mid-upper-arm circumference
and triceps skinfold thickness) should
be taken to obtain more information on the
origin of any change in body weight

To assess weight changes, the actual and usual weight of an indi&shy;vidual must be
known. From these two measure&shy;ments, the per&shy;cent&shy;age of usual weight, per&shy;cent&shy;age
of weight loss (or weight gain), and rate of change can be calculated
using the equations shown in Box&nbsp;10.4. The indi&shy;vidual's
actual weight can also be compared with appropriate age- and sex-specific
refer&shy;ence data.

<b>Weight changes in children</b>
<p></p>
In low income countries, where there
is a high prevalence of under-nutrition,
weekly weight gain has often been
used to monitor short-term response of children
to a feeding program. For example in the past, in children with severe
acute malnu&shy;trition (SAM), percen&shy;tage weight gain was applied as the
discharge criterion. However, use of a weight-based assess&shy;ment can be
misleading in children with SAM. Such children may have diarrheal
disease accom&shy;panied by dehydration or edema, both of which have an
affect on body weight

Both lack of weight gain and weight loss in a child have been
shown to be independ&shy;ently and more closely related to
mortality than other indicators of under&shy;nutrition,

A change outside &pm;0.2 BMI&#8209;SDs per year was classified as a high

Between 2005&ndash;2020, there was a small but stable positive
trend in the proportion of children with a high positive weight
change, especially within those children with obesity.
This trend was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion
with a high negative weight change.

Marked changes in body weight in healthy adults with age have been documented
in several national surveys in industrialized countries. Such changes may have
long-term consequences on health.
In general during the period from young to middle
adulthood, adults gain weight more rapidly and
accrue excess adi&shy;pos&shy;ity, whereas
from middle to late adulthood, weight begins to stabilize or even decrease,
espe&shy;cially around age&nbsp;70y, when the
decrease may continue for the remainder of life.
<p></p>
Several investigators have examined the association
between weight changes across adulthood and mortality.
For example, in a pro&shy;spec&shy;tive cohort study of

reported stable obesity across adulthood, weight gain
from young (age&nbsp;25y) to middle
adulthood (mean age&nbsp;47y),
and weight loss from middle to late adulthood,
were associated with increased risk of mortality.
These findings suggest that main&shy;tain&shy;ing a normal healthy
weight across adult&shy;hood, and especially pre&shy;vent&shy;ing
weight gain in early adult&shy;hood, is
impor&shy;tant for preven&shy;ting premature deaths in later life.
<p></p>
The potential effect of weight loss and weight gain
among older adults has also been investigated.
In a systematic review and meta-analysis
of community-dwelling older adults aged &gt;&nbsp;65y,
the effect of weight loss on increased risk of all-cause mortality
was stronger than weight gain

However, the point at
which weight loss may indicate increased mortality
risk has not been clearly defined.
Further research is needed to determine whether
these associations vary with gender,
initial weight, and whether or not the
weight loss/gain was intentional.
<p></p>
Nevertheless, caution when interpreting the results
of some of these epidemiological studies is warrented.
Methodological issues of concern include confounding by smoking,
reverse causation due to existing chronic diseases,
especially among the elderly, and non-specific loss
of lean mass and function in the frail elderly

have compiled new guidelines
for gesta&shy;tional weight gain in response to the increase in
the proportion of U.S. women of reproductive age
who are over&shy;weight and obese.  Gestational weight gain includes
gains in maternal and fetal fat-mass and fat-free mass,
as well as the placenta and amniotic fluid.
How these different components of gesta&shy;tional weight gain
influence both maternal and offspring health remains uncertain:

For the first time, the new U.S guidelines consider those
health outcomes of both mother and child during and after
delivery which are plausibly related to gesta&shy;tional weight gain,
and the trade-offs between them. For the mother,
the most important health outcomes considered were
postpartum weight retention and unscheduled cesarean
delivery, whereas for the infants the outcomes were
preterm birth, extremes of birthweight
(expressed as small- or large-for gesta&shy;tional age),
and childhood obesity

<p></p>
The new U.S. recommen&shy;dations include a relatively narrow range of
recom&shy;mended weight gain for
obese women. However, because of the lack of data,
no recommen&shy;dations were made to reduce the guide&shy;lines for
obese women to below 5.0&ndash;9.0kg,
or specific guidelines according to
obesity classes II&nbsp;and&nbsp;III. Women with a
pre-pregnancy BMI indicative of
obesity are recom&shy;mended to lose weight before
and not during pregnancy, and clinicians
are encouraged to monitor weight gain at
each prenatal visit. Interventions may be
needed to assist women, especially those
who are over&shy;weight or obese at the time of conception, to meet these guidelines.

Weight to height ratios indicate body weight in relation to height
and are partic&shy;ularly useful for
providing a measure of over&shy;weight
and obesity in adult populations. Hence these ratios are sometimes
referred to as obesity indices.
<p></p>
At the present time, the ratio most used in this way is the body
mass index (BMI) (also termed Quetelet's index), calculated as
weight (kg) / height<sup>2</sup> (m).
Body mass index is used in preference
to other weight / height indices, including the weight / height ratio,
the Ponderal index, and Benn's index
<a href="#table10.6">(Table&nbsp;10.6)</a>.
<a id="table10.6"></a>

BMI is now widely used to classify over&shy;weight and
obesity in adults.
<p></p>

Body mass index is relatively unbiased by
height and correlates reasonably well
with other anthro&shy;pometric measures of
adiposity in adults such as waist
circum&shy;ference (WC) and abdominal visceral fat (AVF), as shown in
<a href="#figure10.22">Figure&nbsp;10.22.</a>
For details on the importance of waist circum&shy;ference and abdominal
visceral fat, see Chapter&nbsp;11.

Body mass index is employed in large-scale nutrition surveys and
epidemio&shy;logical studies as a measure of over&shy;weight and obesity;
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments of weight and height are easy, quick, relatively
noninvasive, and more precise than skinfold thickness
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments.
Nevertheless, BMI does not quantify total body adiposity or
distinguish between weight associated with muscle and weight
associated with body fat. Hence, in some circumstances, an
elevated BMI may result from excessive adiposity, muscularity, or
edema, and is thus an inaccurate mea&shy;sure&shy;ment for adiposity at the
individual level.
<p></p>
Certain population groups may also be misclas&shy;sified as over&shy;weight
or obese based on BMI, due to differences in body proportions and
the relation&shy;ship between BMI and body fat content. M&#257;ori and
some Polynesian groups, for example, appear to have less body fat
than Caucasians of the same age, sex, and BMI

Such adjustments are necessary for example, among Australian Aboriginals.
<p></p>
In addition, BMI conveys no information about the actual
distribution of body fat. Anomalies in the distribution
of abdominal visceral fat, and in particular ectopic fat (i.e., fat
depots in liver, heart, muscle, pancreas and kidney) are now
recognized to be an even greater cardio&shy;metabolic risk than excess
body fat <i>per se</i>

<span data-tippy-content="Neeland, I. J., Ross, R., Després, J. P., Matsuzawa, Y., Yamashita, S., Shai, I., Seidell, J., Magni, P., Santos, R. D., Arsenault, B., Cuevas, A., Hu, F.

target="right" >Neeland et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>).</span>

Conse&shy;quently, BMI alone
can misrepresent the burden of abdominal visceral fat in a
subgroup of individuals who are at highest cardiometabolic risk.
Therefore, a BMI within the normal range does not necessarily preclude an
increased cardio&shy;metabolic risk. In a community-dwelling adult
men in Korea, for example, assess&shy;ment of cardiometabolic risk
based on high blood pressure, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia,
was highest among those with
a BMI &lt;&nbsp;25kg/m<sup>2</sup> but who had a
high waist circum&shy;ference (i.e., &gt;&nbsp;90cm).
Moreover, in this group
the amounts of both total fat mass and per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat
(assessed via bioelec&shy;trical impedance analysis) were similar to the
group with a BMI &gt;&nbsp;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>
and a waist circum&shy;ference &lt;&nbsp;90cm

target="right" >Kim et al., 2020</a>).</span>

<p></p>
Therefore, increasingly a combination of both waist circum&shy;ference
(as a surrogate estimate of abdominal visceral fat) and BMI are
being used to predict risk of cardiovascular disease

<span data-tippy-content="Nazare, J. A., Smith, J., Borel, A. L., Aschner, P., Barter, P., Van Gaal, L., Tan, C. E., Wittchen, H.

In the future, simple clinically applicable tools to monitor
changes over time in abdominal visceral fat and ectopic fat need to
be developed for use with BMI and waist circum&shy;ference.
Currently, the laboratory methods available are used mainly in research
settings; they are described in Chapter&nbsp;14.

In the simpler 2&#8209;component model, total body mass
is partitioned into total body fat and fat-free mass,
applying the principle that if one of the components
is measured, the other can be estimated.
However, when using this approach, the calculation of
body fat depends on certain theoretical assumptions.
The hydration of fat-free mass, for example, is assumed
to be constant within and between individuals even
though inter-individual variability is known to exist,
especially during growth and maturation in children,
in pregnancy, and among adults with varying adiposity

In Figure&nbsp;10.23, for example, the relation
between BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and body fat (as a percentage)
was assessed using a 4&#8209;component model in
young (&lt;&nbsp;35y) and elderly (&gt;&nbsp;65y) women.
A comparable relation between BMI and body fat mass (kg) was also observed.
In this study, measurements were collected on
body weight, body volume, total body water,
and bone mineral mass, allowing the inter-individual
variability in the composition of the fat-free mass
to be considered rather than assuming fixed constants
for the water content, bone mineral content, or
density of fat-free mass

<span data-tippy-content="Wells, J. C., & Fewtrell, M. S. (2006). Measuring body composition. Archives of disease in childhood, 91(7), 612–617. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/16790722/"
target="right" >Wells & Fewtrell, 2006</a>).</span>

Consequently, the four-component model is the established criterion reference method for generating accurate data on body fat and fat-free mass. For more details of these methods used to assess body composition, see Chapter&nbsp;14

<p></p>
Over the last few decades,
validation studies have analyzed the performance of
BMI to detect body adiposity by comparison with a variety of techniques
considered to measure body composition accurately.  They have included a
combination of statistical approaches
including correlation and regression
analyses, paired t&#8209;tests, and more recently,
Bland-Altman analyses. In some cases, the sensitivity and specificity
of the methods have also been compared

A major assumption of BMI has been that it is an independent
index of body fat. This means that after adjusting for body
weight-for-stature, all subjects with the same BMI have the same relative
fatness, irrespective of their age, sex, or ethnicity. However, it is
now widely known that the relation&shy;ship between BMI and
per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat is influenced by age, sex, and ethnicity, all of
which have implications for the use of BMI as an index of body
fatness

For example, in the cross-sectional study
shown in Figure 10.23, older women tended to have a relatively
greater per&shy;cent&shy;age of body fat than their younger counterparts
with a comparable BMI

<span data-tippy-content="Gallagher, D., Visser, M., Sepúlveda, D., Pierson, R. N., Harris, T., & Heymsfield, S. B. (1996). How useful is body mass index for comparison of body fatness across age, sex, and ethnic groups?. American journal of epidemiology, 143(3), 228–239. ">

A similar age-related trend was noted for men; these age-related trends
persist up to 60&ndash;65y of age in both sexes.  According to a recent
critical review based on data from the U.S NHANES survey, such
age-related changes in body composition by both men and women
possibly reflect senescence-mediated hormonal changes, lowering
of physical activity levels, reductions in trunk length owing to
osteoporosis, and a variety of other related mechanisms

Moreover, women have significantly greater amounts of total body
fat than do men for an equivalent BMI suggesting that BMI cannot
be used as a comparable measure of fatness in males and females.
These sex differences are substantial and
are maintained throughout the entire adult life span

Of the 15 studies included in the meta-analyses, 11 used those
considered by the investigators to be a &ldquo;reference criterion
method&rdquo; for the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of body fat, and
included hydrostatic
weighing, deuterium dilution, and DXA.
Results of the meta-analysis indicate that
in some populations (e.g., some Chinese, urban Thais,
Indonesians), levels of obesity in terms of per&shy;cent&shy;age of body fat
will be greater at the 30kg/m<sup>2</sup> obesity cutoff
suggested by WHO

differences in body shape and body composition, some of which
may be inherited and others due to environ&shy;mental and lifestyle

Indeed, the relative risk for
cardiovascular disease risk factors and cardiovascular disease
incidence increases in a graded fashion with increasing BMI in all
population groups. Nevertheless, the risk of type&nbsp;2 diabetes
appears to vary according to race/ethnicity and presence or absence
of other traditional risk factors, with Chinese Americans,
Hispanics, African Americans over a 10y period having a similar
risk at lower BMI values compared with those for white

The WHO International Obesity Task Force defined obesity as
a condition in which abnormal or excessive fat accumulation may
impair health. (WHO, 2000). They have recommended the use of a
graded classification of both over&shy;weight and obesity to:
<ul>
<li>Compare weight status within and between populations
<li>Identify individuals and groups who are at increased risk of
morbidity and mortality
<li>Identify priorities for intervention at both the individual and
community levels
<li>Allow interventions to be evaluated appropriately

The classification is based primarily on the association between
BMI and mortality. WHO considers BMI as the most useful
population-level measure of over&shy;weight and obesity as it is the
same for both male and female adults and for all ages of adults.

This classification system is not intended for use with pregnant and
lactating women, or persons &lt;&nbsp;18y.

WHO (1995a) have also
suggested that a universal cutoff point of BMI &ge;&nbsp;30
could be used to
estimate and compare the prevalence of obesity within and between
populations.

recognized that these BMI cutoff points for
over&shy;weight and obesity may not correspond to the same d.egree of
fatness and risk of obesity-related co-morbidities across different
race/ethnic populations, as noted earlier. In particular, in their 2004
report, WHO emphasized the mounting evidence that certain Asian
populations have a partic&shy;ularly high risk of type&nbsp;2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and mortality from other causes at
relatively lower BMIs.
However, WHO did not consider there
was enough evidence for a single BMI cutoff point for all Asians
for over&shy;weight or obesity at that time.
Nevertheless, a report cosponsored by the WHO Western Pacific
Region (WPRO) and led by the International Association for the
Study of Obesity and the International Obesity Task Force

More recent research findings in South Asian populations suggest
that a BMI &ge;&nbsp;23kg/m<sup>2</sup> is not sensitive
enough to identify the obesity-associated
disease risk in these populations, and indicate that an even
lower cutoff (i.e., BMI &ge;&nbsp;21kg/m<sup>2</sup>)
may be more appropriate in
South Asian countries

cautions that the classification system may
misclas&shy;sify certain population groups such as adults with a very
lean body build or who are highly muscular, young adults who
have not reached full growth, those over 65y, and
certain ethnic and racial groups. Several health problems
associated with over&shy;weight and obesity are also specified. They
include coronary heart disease, type&nbsp;2 diabetes, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, gallbladder disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and
certain cancers. A combination of BMI with waist circum&shy;ference
as a measure of abdominal visceral fat are now used to screen for
over&shy;weight and obesity and to assess a person's risk of health
problems (i.e., Type&nbsp;2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and the
metabolic syndrome, which combines three of these conditions)

<h3 id="10.3.4">10.3.4 U.S. classification of over&shy;weight
and obesity in adults</h3>

The cutoff points that define normal weight, over&shy;weight, and the
various categories of obesity in the United States are now the same
as those used by WHO

<span data-tippy-content="47.	World Health Organisation. (2024). Obesity and over&shy;weight. Fact sheet  World Health Organisation.">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight"

and are presented in
<a href="#table10.7">Table&nbsp;10.7.</a>
<p></p>
Obesity is often subdivided into three categories in the United
States, with class III (i.e., BMI&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;40)
designated as &ldquo;severe obesity&rdquo;.
These BMI cutoff points for adults define over&shy;weight and
class I to III obese individuals and identify those who may be at
increased risk for cardiovascular disease and other obesity-related
conditions. However, within these categories, personal additional
risk assess&shy;ment is also needed because degree of risk can vary. For
more details on the assess&shy;ment and treat&shy;ment of cardiovascular risk
factors and obesity-comorbidities for individuals with over&shy;weight
or class&nbsp;I to&nbsp;III obesity,
the reader is referred to the AHA/ACC/TOS guideline

<span data-tippy-content="Jensen, M. D., Ryan, D. H., Apovian, C. M., Ard, J. D., Comuzzie, A. G., Donato, K. A., Hu, F. B., Hubbard, V. S., Jakicic, J. M., Kushner, R. F., Loria, C. M., Millen, B.

Note that these guidelines also recommend the
mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of waist circum&shy;ference in patients with BMI
25&ndash;34.9kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
The waist circum&shy;ference cutoff points indicative of
increased cardiometabolic risk used in the United
States are &gt;&nbsp;88cm for women
and &gt;&nbsp;102cm for men. These same waist
circum&shy;ference cutoffs are also used for adult Canadians. See
Chapter&nbsp;11 for more details of the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of waist
circum&shy;ference.

<h3 id="10.3.5">10.3.5 BMI and chronic energy deficiency in adults</h3>

In low-income countries, low values for BMI in adults have been
consistently associated with a decline in work output, productivity,
and income generating ability, as well as a compromised ability to
respond to stressful conditions

<span data-tippy-content="Ferro-Luzzi, A., Sette, S., Franklin, M., & James, W. P. (1992). A simplified approach of assessing adult chronic energy deficiency. European journal of clinical nutrition, 46(3), 173–186. ">

target="right" >Ferro&#8209;Luzzi et&nbsp;al., 1992</a>).</span>

Underweight has also been associated with increased mortality.
For example, in an early study in India, a progressive increase in
mortality rate below a BMI of 18.5 was reported, with an almost
threefold higher rate after ten years for those with BMI below 16

<span data-tippy-content="Naidu, A. N., & Rao, N. P. (1994). Body mass index: a measure of the nutritional status in Indian populations. European journal of clinical nutrition, 48 Suppl 3, S131–S140. ">

target="right" >Naidu & Rao, 1994</a>).</span>

Whether the individuals were ill prior to the
mea&shy;sure&shy;ment is unknown, however, making it difficult to assign
the trend to any causal relation&shy;ship.  Nevertheless, some evidence
for such a relation&shy;ship has been reported based on more recent
meta-analysis of prospective studies across continents

In developed countries, some of the early studies of low BMI and
mortality failed to control for two principal sources of bias:
cigarette smoking, and the elimination of thin adults with early
mortality, many of whom may had been already ill when measured

excess deaths associated with under&shy;weight (as well as over&shy;weight
and obesity) in the U.S&nbsp;NHANES data. In their study, they noted an
increase in mortality with both
under&shy;weight (BMI &lt;&nbsp;18.5) and with
obesity (BMI &ge;&nbsp;30), but not with over&shy;weight
(i.e., BMI &ge;&nbsp;>25 but &lt;&nbsp;30).
In most developed countries today, underweight is common in
adults in hospitals and nursing homes, almost invariably secondary
to disease, although in some more affluent countries under&shy;weight
has been associated with osteoporosis, infertility, and impaired

In any healthy adult population, 3%&ndash;5% can be expected to have a

countries with food insecurity, an
excessive proportion of the population may have
BMIs &lt;&nbsp;18.5, with

In many low&#8209; and middle-income countries, this trend has now occurred
with a rising prevalence of over&shy;weight and obesity

over&shy;weight, obesity or diet-related noncommunicable diseases

rates of under&shy;weight and chronic energy deficiency.

have cautioned that BMI will
falsely classify some children of normal fatness as over&shy;weight and
some over&shy;weight children as not over&shy;weight. Although errors in
the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of per&shy;cent&shy;age of body
fat may account for some
of the variability in the relation&shy;ship between BMI and body fatness
in children, several other factors may be implicated. These include
enhanced muscular development, large head size, and a high
torso-to-leg ratio. All these factors may falsely elevate BMI into an
over&shy;weight range in some &ldquo;non-over&shy;weight&rdquo; children

<p></p>
Defining over&shy;weight and obesity in children is more difficult than
in adults. In children BMI has a characteristic curvilinear shape
with age so that no simple cutoff can be used to define over&shy;weight
or obesity, so the age-independent adult BMI classifications are not
appropriate. Indeed, the 50th per&shy;centile for BMI for younger
children and adolescents increases markedly from birth to early
adulthood.
These challenges have led many countries to use their national
reference to compile their own ways of defining over&shy;weight and
obesity in children making it impossible to make comparisons
across countries

<span data-tippy-content="Rolland-Cachera M. F. (2011). Childhood obesity: current definitions and recommendations for their use. International journal of pediatric obesity : IJPO : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity, 6(5-6), 325–331. ">

<p></p>
There are three main classification schemes that are used
inter&shy;nation&shy;ally to define over&shy;weight
and obesity in children. They
are all based on BMI per&shy;cent&shy;iles or SD scores derived from growth
charts to account for gains in weight relative to height and each is
described below.

<h3 id="10.4.1">10.4.1 International
Obesity Task Force (IOTF)
mass index cutoffs for over&shy;weight and obesity in children</h3>

In 1998, WHO convened an International Task Force on Obesity to
define over&shy;weight and obesity in children and adolescents.
This expert group agreed to recommend the
adoption of an earlier approach developed by the European
Childhood Obesity group

<span data-tippy-content="Poskitt E. M. (1995). Defining childhood obesity: the relative body mass index (BMI). European Childhood Obesity group. Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992), 84(8), 961–963. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/7488831/"
target="right" >Poskitt, 1995</a>)</span>

but based on an international reference population.
<p></p>
To accomplish this recommendation, Cole et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Cole, T. J., Bellizzi, M. C., Flegal, K. M., & Dietz, W. H. (2000). Establishing a standard definition for child over&shy;weight and obesity worldwide: international survey. BMJ (Clinical research ed.), 320(7244), 1240–1243.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/10797032/"
target="right" >2000</a>)</span>

compiled data for BMI for children 2&ndash;18y from six
large nationally representative cross-sectional growth studies
(Brazil, Great Britain, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Singapore,
and the United States). The data were used to construct two
country-specific per&shy;centile curves passing through the adult
definitions of both
over&shy;weight (BMI&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>)
and obesity (&gt;&nbsp;30kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at age 18y for each sex.
The curves were then averaged
across countries by age to yield sex-specific curves for each
cutoff.
<p></p>
A major disadvantage of these international (IOTF) cutoffs,
however, was that they could not be expressed as per&shy;cent&shy;iles (e.g.,
85<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile) or standard
deviation scores (&plus;2 Zscores).
As a result they could not be compared with other
reference data in which the BMI cutoffs were defined by age-sex-
specific BMI per&shy;cent&shy;iles (e.g., 85<sup>th</sup>
or 95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile) or standard
deviation scores (e.g., &plus;2SDs).
Conse&shy;quently, Cole and Lobstein

<span data-tippy-content="Cole, T. J., & Lobstein, T. (2012). Extended international (IOTF) body mass index cutoffs for thinness, over&shy;weight and obesity. Pediatric obesity, 7(4), 284–294.">

BMI to be expressed as a per&shy;centile or SD score.

or per&shy;centile equivalent.
Only small
differences (&lt;&nbsp;0.2% on average) were observed when these new
international IOFT cutoffs were compared with the original
cutoffs based on prevalence rates for over&shy;weight and obesity from US
and Chinese data.

A worked example on how to derive these new cutoffs for
obesity in children is given in the appendix of
Cole and Lobstein

<span data-tippy-content="Cole, T. J., & Lobstein, T. (2012). Extended international (IOTF) body mass index cutoffs for thinness, over&shy;weight and obesity. Pediatric obesity, 7(4), 284–294.">

allowing researchers to construct
their own cutoffs for any required BMI (e.g., BMI 23 for Asians)
at 18y. The adoption of this reformulated approach has several important
advantages. In summary:
<ul>
<li>Use of weight-for-stature charts, that cover only a
restricted age range, and omit adolescence entirely, are
eliminated
<li>Obesity assess&shy;ment in adults is integrated with that in
children and adolescents
<li>Existing cutoffs can now be expressed as per&shy;cent&shy;iles or SD
scores allowing comparison with other BMI references
<li>New cutoffs are easy to derive (e.g., BMI for morbid
obesity)
</ul>

<h3 id="10.4.2">10.4.2 WHO classification of
over-weight and obesity in children</h3>

With the development of international growth references for both
young children 0&ndash;5y and school-aged children and adolescents for
clinical and epidemiological use, WHO has adopted cutoffs points
for over&shy;weight and obesity for the two age groups based on
standard deviation scores (i.e., Z&#8209;scores) derived from the
corresponding BMI-for-age curves of the corresponding reference
data.

Details for the justification of these WHO cutoffs were not
provided. The more stringent WHO cutoffs for children aged
&lt;&nbsp;5y compared to those &ge;&nbsp;5y were
proposed to avoid over&shy;diagnosis
of obesity in younger children; the increase in average
BMI observed in all age groups of children has been greater in the
older children since the 1990s. Hence, the current trend in BMI in
children no longer reflects what is
termed &ldquo;age agnosticism&rdquo;,
in which the risk of obesity is assumed to be constant throughout
infancy and childhood

The smoothed per&shy;cent&shy;iles of the original
U.S CDC reference growth charts
extended only up to the 97<sup>th</sup>
per&shy;centile. The marked rise in the prevalence of extreme obesity
among children in the U.S
(i.e, BMI &gt;&nbsp;99<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile of the CDC
growth charts) has led to alternative definitions of severe obesity in
U.S children aged &gt;&nbsp;2&ndash;19y.
They include:  BMI &gt;&nbsp;120% of
the 95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile
(1.2 &times; 95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile) for age, or an absolute
BMI &gt;&nbsp;35kg/m<sup>2</sup> for adolescents,
whichever is lower based on age
and sex. The inclusion of an absolute
BMI &gt;&nbsp;35kg/m<sup>2</sup> threshold
was chosen by the American Heart Association because it aligns
the pediatric definition of severe obesity with the U.S class II
obesity in adults (Table 10.7), in whom there is a high risk of
early mortality

However, these alternative definitions of severe
obesity in children aged &gt;&nbsp;2 to 19y have some limitations
which have been discussed in detail in a recent CDC report by
Hales et al.

CDC has now extended their BMI distribution
on their BMI-for-age growth charts by using additional
data from NHANES (1999&ndash;2016), rather than
relying on extrapolation. These BMI-for-age charts
extend up to a BMI of 60kg/m<sup>2</sup> with four
additional per&shy;centile curves above the 95<sup>th</sup>
(i.e., 98<sup>th</sup>, 99<sup>th</sup>, 99.9<sup>th</sup>,
and 99.99<sup>th</sup>) by gender.

For monitoring growth of U.S children without obesity, however,
the 2000 CDC BMI-for-age growth charts (e.g., Figure 10.27)
should be used.

Unlike the two different cutoffs for children
aged &lt;&nbsp;5y versus &ge;&nbsp;5y set by WHO

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/18026621/"
target="right" >de&nbsp;Onis et&nbsp;al., 2007</a>),</span>

the CDC per&shy;centile cutoffs assume that the
risk of obesity is constant throughout childhood,
thus reflecting &ldquo;age agnosticism&rdquo;, an approach
suggested to result in overdiagnosis of obesity in
younger children

<span data-tippy-content="Wright, C. M., Cole, T. J., Fewtrell, M., Williams, J. E., Eaton, S., & Wells, J. C. (2022). Body composition data show that high BMI centiles overdiagnose obesity in children aged under 6 years. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 116(1), 122–131. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/34967839/"
target="right" >Wright et&nbsp;al., 2022</a>).</span>

However, the CDC does caution that &ldquo;in&#8209;depth assessments&rdquo;
are required to determine whether children and
adolescents with BMI-for-age &gt;&nbsp;95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile
are truly overfat, and at increased risk for health complications.
<p></p>
Skinfold thickness and waist circumference have
been proposed as alternatives for quantifying
adiposity in over&shy;weight and obese children and
adolescents but are challenging in children
with severe obesity and not recommended.
For a review of the existing evidence for
an association of excess adiposity with cardiovascular
and metabolic risk in children, see Chung et al.

<span data-tippy-content="Chung, S. T., Onuzuruike, A. U., & Magge, S. N. (2018). Cardiometabolic risk in obese children. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1411(1), 166–183. ">

<h3 id="10.4.4">10.4.4 Comparisons of over&shy;weight and obesity in children
among countries</h3>

BMI is accepted as a valid indirect measure of adiposity
in children. However, unlike adults,
the 50<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile BMI varies with
age as well as weight.  Consequently, BMI values
in childhood must be compared with age and sex-specific
reference data sets.  Unfortunately, differences
exist in the methods that have been used to construct the
curves for the reference data sets, some of which are based
on representative national data (e.g., 2000 CDC reference data),
whereas others provide international reference data

<span data-tippy-content="Cole, T. J., Bellizzi, M. C., Flegal, K. M., & Dietz, W. H. (2000). Establishing a standard definition for child over&shy;weight and obesity worldwide: international survey. BMJ (Clinical research ed.), 320(7244), 1240–1243.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/10797032/"
target="right" >Cole et al., 2000</a>;</span>

<span data-tippy-content="WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group (2006). WHO Child Growth Standards based on length/height, weight and age. Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992). Supplement, 450, 76–85.">
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/16817681/"
target="right" >WHO, 2006</a>).</span>

Marked variations across countries also occur in the
terminology used to define the levels of BMI
indicative of over&shy;weight and obesity.  For example,
based on the French BMI reference data, &ldquo;over&shy;weight&rdquo;
corresponds to values above the 97<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile
and no cutoff for &ldquo;obesity&rdquo; exists

<span data-tippy-content="Rolland-Cachera, M. F., Castetbon, K., Arnault, N., Bellisle, F., Romano, M. C., Lehingue, Y., Frelut, M. L., & Hercberg, S. (2002). Body mass index in 7-9-y-old French children: frequency of obesity, over&shy;weight and thinness. International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity, 26(12), 1610–1616. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/12461677/"
target="right" >Rolland-Cachera et&nbsp;al., 2002</a>),</span>

whereas the US CDC now define over&shy;weight as a BMI &ge;&nbsp;85<sup>th</sup>
per&shy;centile but &lt;&nbsp;95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile,
and obesity as &ge;&nbsp;95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;centile.
In contrast, WHO apply Z&#8209;scores to
indicate &ldquo;risk of over&shy;weight&rdquo;, &ldquo;over&shy;weight&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;obesity&rdquo;, and these differ for children
less than and greater than aged&nbsp;5y (Section 10.4.2).
<p></p>
As a result of these differences, comparison of the
prevalence of over&shy;weight and obesity across
countries is challenging, and the prevalence
estimates differ even when compared in the same
population of children.  For example, estimates
often appear highest when using the WHO classification
systems, intermediate with the
2000 CDC definition,
and lowest based on the IOTF definition

<span data-tippy-content="Shields, M., & Tremblay, M. S. (2010). Canadian childhood obesity estimates based on WHO, IOTF and CDC cut-points. International journal of pediatric obesity : IJPO : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity, 5(3), 265–273.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/20210678/"
target="right" >Shields & Tremblay, 2010</a>).</span>

<p></p>
An additional challenge complicating the interpretation
of the data is the absence of international validated
gold-standard upper BMI cutoffs for over&shy;weight
and obesity in childhood.  The existing prospective
studies in which excess adiposity in children
has been associated with risk of cardiovascular
disease are limited by small sample sizes

<span data-tippy-content="Chung, S. T., Onuzuruike, A. U., & Magge, S. N. (2018). Cardiometabolic risk in obese children. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1411(1), 166–183. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/29377201/"
target="right" >Chung et al., 2018</a>).</span>

Moreover, to date, there are no large-scale longitudinal
data that relate over&shy;weight in childhood with
adverse health outcomes in adulthood because of the
long-time span required before they appear
(i.e., middle-age or beyond)

<span data-tippy-content="Wright, C. M., Cole, T. J., Fewtrell, M., Williams, J. E., Eaton, S., & Wells, J. C. (2022). Body composition data show that high BMI centiles overdiagnose obesity in children aged under 6 years. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 116(1), 122–131. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/34967839/"
target="right" >Wright et&nbsp;al., 2022</a>).</span>

This has led to the conventional statistical definitions
for the BMI cutoffs for over&shy;weight and obesity, with the
assumption that the prevalence of over&shy;weight or obesity
is the same for each age&#8209; and sex-specific group, even
though it appears that older children now
experience a greater increase in BMI than younger children.
<p></p>
Clearly, an international consensus is necessary
before meaningful comparisons between studies of
over&shy;weight and obesity during childhood can be made

<span data-tippy-content="Rolland-Cachera, M. F., Castetbon, K., Arnault, N., Bellisle, F., Romano, M. C., Lehingue, Y., Frelut, M. L., & Hercberg, S. (2002).

The current recommendation by the European Childhood Obesity Group (ECOG)
is to use the IOTF and WHO definitions for international
comparisons of the prevalence of childhood over&shy;weight and obesity,
despite their limitations. For comparison within countries,
however, national age&#8209; and sex-specific BMI reference
data and definitions of over&shy;weight and obesity are appropriate

<p></p>
Unfortunately, the evidence to identify children who are
truly at risk for future adverse health outcomes
arising from over&shy;weight or obesity remains
insufficient. It appears that the conventional
statistical approach to define over&shy;weight and obesity
is no longer valid and results in overdiagnosis of
obesity in younger children when a true measure of
total fat mass is determined based on dual energy x&#8209;ray absorptiometry

Therefore, more research is urgently needed to improve the diagnosis of childhood obesity and define its adverse health consequences.

<h3 id="10.4.5">10.4.5 Using BMI to define thinness
in children and adolescents</h3>

The term &ldquo;thinness&rdquo; was adopted by Cole et al.

<span data-tippy-content="Cole, T. J., Flegal, K. M., Nicholls, D., & Jackson, A. A. (2007). Body mass index cut offs to define thinness in children and adolescents: international survey. BMJ (Clinical research ed.), 335(7612), 194.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/17591624/"
target="right" >2007</a>)</span>

to describe a low BMI to avoid
confusion with the terms &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; (defined by a
weight-for-stature&lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score) and
&ldquo;under&shy;weight&rdquo; (defined by a weight-for-
age &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score).
<p></p>

Cole et al.

<span data-tippy-content="Cole, T. J., Flegal, K. M., Nicholls, D., & Jackson, A. A. (2007). Body mass index cut offs to define thinness in children and adolescents: international survey. BMJ (Clinical research ed.), 335(7612), 194.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/17591624/"
target="right" >2007</a>)</span>

used the same methods to define
grades of thinness in children and adolescents as they used previously to
define over&shy;weight and obesity in this age group (Section&nbsp;10.4.1).
For each dataset,
per&shy;centile curves were drawn to pass through the BMI cutoff
values of 18.5, 17, and 16kg/m<sup>2</sup> at age 18y,
consistent with the
grades 1, 2, and 3 of thinness used by WHO for adults (Table&nbsp;10.12).
The per&shy;centile curve passing through a BMI value of
17kg/m<sup>2</sup> at age 18y gave a mean
BMI close to a Z&#8209;score of &minus;2,
matching the existing WHO criteria for wasting in children less
than 5y of age (i.e., weight-for-height
below &minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score).  Hence,
the authors proposed that this per&shy;centile curve should be a basis for
an international definition of thinness in children and adolescents.
<p></p>
However, a major disadvantage of these childhood BMI cutoffs for
thinness is that they are not expressible as BMI per&shy;cent&shy;iles.
Conse&shy;quently, Cole and Lobstein
reformulated their international cutoffs
for thinness for children aged 2&ndash;18y so that BMI could be
expressed as per&shy;cent&shy;iles or Z&#8209;scores
for comparison with the WHO BMI cutoffs
