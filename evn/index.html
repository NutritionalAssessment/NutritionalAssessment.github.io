<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
This chapter addresses the assess&shy;ment
of nutrient intakes and the planning of nutritious diets
at both the indi&shy;vidual and population level. 
To assess intakes at the indi&shy;vidual level
for nutrients with an Average Require&shy;ment (AR) and Recom&shy;mended Intake (RI),
the likelihood of inade&shy;quacy
can be assessed by using a statistical test 
that examines the indi&shy;vidual's observed usual intake
in combination with measures of variability of intakes and requirements. For nutrients
with an Ade&shy;quate Intake (AI) and Upper Intake Level (UL), statistical tests
can be used to determine the level of confidence 
that an indi&shy;vidual's observed usual intake
is at or above the AI, or below the UL, respectively.
Alternatively, published guidelines can provide a qualitative interpretation of the
adequacy of  an indi&shy;vidual's usual intake of nutrients and macro&shy;nutrients
in relation to the Nutrient Reference Values
(NRVs), and the Acceptable Macro&shy;nutrient Distri&shy;bution 
Range (expressed as a percentage of energy) (AMDR), respectively.
<p></p>
For assess&shy;ment of intakes at the group level, the
proportion with usual nutrient intakes below 
the AR and/or above the UL can be calculated by
the prob&shy;ability approach or the simpler Estimated 
Average Require&shy;ment (EAR) cutpoint method. For nutrients
with an AI that represents the mean or median intake
of an apparently healthy group, when the group mean or median
intake is at or above the AI, then it is likely
that the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes for the group is low.
<p></p>
When planning nutritious diets for indi&shy;viduals, usual
nutrient intakes should fall between the RI<sub>98</sub> and the UL,
or between the AI or UL. For energy and macro&shy;nutrients, however, the
targets for the diet are the indi&shy;vidual's Estimated Energy Require&shy;ment (EER)
and within the AMDR, respectively. For planning nutritious diets for
groups, the current distri&shy;bution of usual nutrient intakes should be
altered to ensure a low preva&shy;lence of undesirable nutrient intakes,
whereas for the appropriate energy level, the group mean energy
intake must be close to the group mean EER. For the
macro&shy;nutrients, diets must be planned to reduce the preva&shy;lence of
intakes outside the AMDR.

Dietary intake data generated from con&shy;ventional dietary
assess&shy;ment methods have been severely criticized in the past
because both random and systematic errors occur in measuring
intakes of food and calculating their nutrient con&shy;tent

The data are also frequently misinter&shy;preted. This is
particularly unfortunate because the careful evaluation of food- and
nutrient-intake data has important uses and applications, provided
that the limitations of the methods are clearly understood.
<p></p>
This chapter describes the assess&shy;ment of nutrient intakes and
the planning of nutritious diets at both the indi&shy;vidual 
and population level. Most of
the approaches used are based on comparison of the usual daily intake
of an indi&shy;vidual or group with the appropriate Nutrient Reference
Values (NRVs) or the Acceptable Macro&shy;nutrient Distri&shy;bution Ranges
(AMDRs). The tables of NRVs have now been expanded in many
countries and regions to include:
<ul class="padded">
<li>An Average Require&shy;ment (AR),
referred, in some countries, as an Estimated
Average require&shy;ment (EAR).
<li>A Recom&shy;mended Intake (RI<sub>98</sub>), termed a Recommended Dietary
Allowance (RDA) in Canada and the U.S.
<li>An Ade&shy;quate Intake (AI) and/or an&nbsp;Upper 
Intake Level (UL), 
</ul>
Each NRV has a specific use as a reference
standard for diet assess&shy;ment and planning; their derivation is
described in Chapter&nbsp;8a. The AI is used for those nutrients for which
there is insufficient available info&shy;rmation to set an AR.
Development of the UL arose because of
the increasing availability of fortified foods and dietary
supplements worldwide, and con&shy;cern about ingesting too much of a nutrient.

Many countries have adopted a new paradigm and set multiple
NRVs rather than just a single value for the Recom&shy;mended
Intake (RI<sub>98</sub>) or equiv&shy;alent (Chapter&nbsp;8a). Nutrient
Reference Values are used for assessing the adequacy of nutrient intakes and
planning nutritious diets for both apparently healthy indi&shy;viduals
and population groups as shown in  <a href="#figure8b.1">Figure&nbsp;8b.1</a>.
However, care must be taken to ensure the appropriate NRV is selected and
the data inter&shy;preted correctly.

Assessment of nutrient intakes and planning nutritious diets at the indi&shy;vidual
level is especially chal&shy;lenging because neither the require&shy;ments of
the indi&shy;vidual nor their usual nutrient intake are known with any
certainty. A quantitative method has been developed to esti&shy;mate the prob&shy;ability
that an indi&shy;vidual's intake or diet meets his or her require&shy;ment. This
method can be used provided NRVs for the nutrient
of inter&shy;est exist and the day-to-day variation in intake of the
nutrient is not high.
<p></p>
<a id="table8b.1"></a>
Alternatively, health professionals can use
published guidelines to provide a more practical qualitative
assess&shy;ment based on the likelihood that the intake of an indi&shy;vidual
is not ade&shy;quate. Both methods can be used for dietary counseling
and nutrition education and for developing a dietary plan that the
indi&shy;vidual can follow.
<p></p>
At the group level, with the inclusion of both an Average
Require&shy;ment (AR) and Upper Intake Level (UL) in the
expanded NRV framework, the focus is no longer on the group
mean intake alone, but also takes into account the distri&shy;butions of
usual intake within a group. With this new focus, the preva&shy;lence of
inade&shy;quate and potentially excessive intakes can be assessed by
estimating the pro&shy;portion within the group whose usual intakes are
less than the AR, and above the UL, respectively, by using either
the prob&shy;ability approach or the simpler EAR cutpoint method. To
ensure a nutritious diet for the group, a plan can be devised to alter
the current distri&shy;bution of usual intakes to reduce the preva&shy;lence of
undesirable intakes.
<p></p>
Guidance on the correct uses of NRVs for planning and assessing
nutrient intakes of indi&shy;viduals and groups to avoid their misuse is
summarized in
<a href="#table8b.1">Table&nbsp;8b.1</a>.

A more detailed discussion of the
correct use of each com&shy;ponent of the NRVs for the assess&shy;ment of
nutrient intakes and planning nutritious diets of indi&shy;viduals and
groups follows.
<p></p>
With the development of more reliable statistical methods to assess
the risk of inade&shy;quate or excessive intakes of nutrients, vulnerable
indi&shy;viduals and subgroups in the population can be more
accurately identified and targeted during inter&shy;vention programs.

that depend on the NRVs using examples from the United States,  Canada, and the United Kingdom.

<h2 id="8b.2">8b.2 Using the NRVs to assess nutrient intakes of an indi&shy;vidual </h2>

None of the methods of assessing nutrient-intake data described
below are capable of identifying with certainty that an indi&shy;vidual's
recorded nutrient intake is ade&shy;quate or excessive.
This is because the
actual nutrient require&shy;ment of an indi&shy;vidual is not known. In
addition, the recorded nutrient-intake data only approx&shy;imate the
indi&shy;vidual's &ldquo;usual&rdquo; nutrient intake, because of normal day-to-day
variation in the diet (Chapter&nbsp;6) combined with mea&shy;sure&shy;ment
errors (Chapter&nbsp;5).  For these reasons, dietary data alone can only
provide an esti&shy;mate of the prob&shy;ability of an inade&shy;quate or excessive intake
of a nutrient.
The reliability of this risk esti&shy;mate depends on the quality of the
dietary data collected and the method used to calculate the esti&shy;mate
of risk.  However, only when biochemical, anthro&shy;pometric, and
clinical assess&shy;ments are combined with the dietary investigation
can a valid assess&shy;ment of an indi&shy;vidual's nutritional status be made.
<p></p>
<a href="#table8b.1">Table&nbsp;8b.1</a>
summarizes the appropriate Nutrient Reference Values
for assessing the nutrient intakes of indi&shy;viduals. Details on planning diets for indi&shy;viduals
are given in
<a href="#8b.4.1">Section&nbsp;8b.4.1</a>.
The outline in this table should always
be followed when assessing nutrient intakes (and planning diets)
for indi&shy;viduals.


<h3 id="8b.2.1">8b.2.1 Using the Average Require&shy;ment</h3>

It is not possible to compare the intake of an indi&shy;vidual
with his or her own require&shy;ment, because the actual
require&shy;ment for any given indi&shy;vidual is not known, as
noted earlier. Moreover, the reported nutrient intake
of an indi&shy;vidual is unlikely to represent their mean usual intake
because of within-person variation in nutrient intakes
combined with mea&shy;sure&shy;ment errors,
as discussed in Chapters&nbsp;5 &nbsp;and&nbsp;6. In view of these uncertainties,
two approaches have been developed to assess the
nutrient intakes of an indi&shy;vidual. The first approach involves
a statistical method that esti&shy;mates the <i>level of
confidence</i> that the usual nutrient intake of an indi&shy;vidual
meets the corres&shy;ponding AR and is discussed below.
The second approach is a qualitative interpretation
of the nutrient intakes of an indi&shy;vidual and is described in
<a href="#8b.2.4">Section&nbsp;8b.2.4</a>.
<p></p>
The statistical approach is based on the following assumptions:
<ul class="padded">
<li>The AR is the best esti&shy;mate of an indi&shy;vidual's require&shy;ment.
<li>There is person-to-person variation
in the require&shy;ments (i.e., between-person variation),
best described by the standard deviation of the require&shy;ment esti&shy;mate (SD<sub>R</sub>).
The latter indicates how much the indi&shy;vidual's require&shy;ment
for a nutrient can deviate from the median require&shy;ment in the population.
In the absence of data for SD<sub>R</sub>,
<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine (US) Subcommittee on Interpretation and Uses of Dietary Reference Intakes, & Institute of Medicine (US) Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes. (2003). Dietary Reference Intakes: Applications in Dietary Planning. National Academies Press (US).">
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25057648/"
target="right" >IOM (2003)</a></span>
has assumed a CV of 10% for most nutrients.
The SD<sub>R</sub> is then calculated from the AR and CV as:
SD<sub>R</sub> &equals; CV &times; AR.
<li>Mean reported intake of an indi&shy;vidual is the best esti&shy;mate of the usual intake of an indi&shy;vidual.
<li>Day-to-day variation in
intake (i.e., within-person variation) for an indi&shy;vidual
exists and can be described by the within-person
standard deviation of intakes
(SD<sub>within</sub>). The latter indicates
how much the reported intake may deviate from the usual intake.
</li>
</ul>
The statistical approach standardizes the difference
between the reported intake of a young woman
for zinc, as an example, and the AR for zinc, by dividing the difference by the
standard deviation of the difference (SD<sub>D</sub>) .
The latter takes into account the day-to-day variability
in zinc intake for the young woman under study, and the
variability of the require&shy;ment  (her zinc
require&shy;ment could differ from the AR)

Note this statistical approach cannot be used when the within-person variation 
is not normally distributed, or when the require&shy;ment distri&shy;bution is skewed

The result of this calculation is a Z&#8209;score.  In general,

<h3 id="8b.2.2">8b.2.2 Using the Adequate Intake</h3>

The approach described in
<a href="#8b.2.1">Section&nbsp;8b.2.1</a>
cannot be used for those
nutrients for which there is
insufficient available infor&shy;mation to set an AR.
Instead, a statistically based hypothesis
testing procedure can be used to compare an indi&shy;vidual's intake to
the AI. Details are also given in IOM
<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine (US) Subcommittee on Interpretation and Uses of Dietary Reference Intakes, & Institute of Medicine (US) Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes. (2000). DRI Dietary Reference Intakes: Applications in Dietary Assessment. National Academies Press (US).">
 (<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/9956/dietary-reference-intakes-applications-in-dietary-assessment"
target="right" >2000</a>).</span>

Again, the procedure con&shy;sists of a Z&#8209;test involving
the difference between the intake of the indi&shy;vidual and the AI, relative
to the esti&shy;mated within-person standard deviation
of the daily intake of the nutrient of interest.
<p></p>
If there is a high degree of confidence that the usual nutrient intake
of an indi&shy;vidual equals or exceeds the
AI, after applying the appropriate statistical test, the diet is almost
certainly likely to be ade&shy;quate in a given nutrient.
In con&shy;trast, no evaluation can be made of the prob&shy;ability of an
inade&shy;quate nutrient intake when the intake of the nutrient falls
below the AI because the require&shy;ment is unknown. In such cases,
the inter&shy;pretation must rely solely on the judgment of nutrition
professionals. In general, to eliminate the possibility of nutrient
inade&shy;quacy, an indi&shy;vidual should be encouraged to
increase his or her nutrient intake to meet the AI

The Upper Intake Level (UL) can be used to determine whether the usual intake of an
indi&shy;vidual is so high that it poses a risk of adverse health effects.
Another statistical test can be used to determine the level of
con&shy;fidence that the usual intake of an indi&shy;vidual is below the UL;
details of this test are also given in

For practical purposes, a qualitative interpretation
of the nutrient intakes of an indi&shy;vidual in relation to
the AR, RI<sub>98</sub>, AI, and UL can be made,
using the guidelines given in <a href="#table8b.4">Table&nbsp;8b.4</a>.
To apply this approach, the intakes of an indi&shy;vidual
must be assessed over a large number of days.
Again, it is preferable to combine such a
qualitative assessment with infor&shy;mation
based on biochemical, clinical, and anthropometric data, where possible.

<h3 id="8b.2.5">8b.2.5 Using the Acceptable Macro&shy;nutrient Distri&shy;bution Range</h3>

If Acceptable Macro&shy;nutrient Distri&shy;bution Ranges (AMDRs) have
been set for indi&shy;viduals for carbo&shy;hydrate, protein, total fat, linoleic
acid, and &alpha;-linolenic acid, e.g., by

<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine (US) Subcommittee on Interpretation and Uses of Dietary Reference Intakes, & Institute of Medicine (US) Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes.

(see Section&nbsp;8a.5.6),
then the usual intake of macro&shy;nutrients (expressed as a
percentage of total energy intake) for an indi&shy;vidual should fall
within these ranges. If the usual intake of a macro&shy;nutrient is
below the AMDR, there is potential for an increased risk of both
inade&shy;quate intake of the essential macro&shy;nutrient and chronic diseases.
The potential for an increased risk of chronic diseases may also occur 
 if the usual intake of a macro&shy;nutrient exceeds the AMDR

<h3 id="8b.2.6">8b.2.6 Using Energy Intakes</h3>

The average esti&shy;mated energy require&shy;ments (EER) are based on a
defined age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity level. Hence,
a mean usual energy intake for an indi&shy;vidual either above or below
their calculated EER, would theoretically result in either weight
gain or weight loss, respectively. However, even based on several
days of energy intake from an indi&shy;vidual, it is difficult to determine
energy balance. Therefore, in practice recent body weight is often
used to assess the likely adequacy of the energy intake of an
indi&shy;vidual

<span data-tippy-content="Barr S. I. (2006). Applications of Dietary Reference Intakes in dietary assessment and planning. Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme, 31(1), 66&ndash;73.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16604145/"
target="right" >Barr, 2006</a>).</span>	

Note that no prob&shy;ability of adequacy can
be assessed for energy, because the intake of energy is almost
always related to energy require&shy;ments, violating one of the
assumptions of the prob&shy;ability approach
(see
<a href="#8b.3.1">Section&nbsp;8b.3.1</a>).

<h2 id="8b.3">8b.3 Using NRVs to assess nutrient intakes of groups </h2>

infor&shy;mation is often required on the pro&shy;portion of a group with
usual intake of a nutrient below their own require&shy;ment. An
esti&shy;mate of the pro&shy;portion of the group with an excessive
usual nutrient intake is also important, as it exposes
that portion of the group to the risk of adverse
effects (See <a href="#table8b.1">Table&nbsp;8b.1</a>).

Unfortunately, there are some examples in the literature in
which the use of the NRVs to determine the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate
intakes has been incorrect, leading to misleading interpretations

<span data-tippy-content="Trumbo, P. R., Barr, S. I., Murphy, S. P., & Yates, A. A. (2013). Dietary reference intakes: cases of appropriate and inappropriate uses. Nutrition reviews, 71(10), 657&ndash;664.">

These may include:
<p></p>
<b>Comparison of the usual intakes of the
indi&shy;viduals with the RI<sub>98</sub>.</b> Reporting
the proportion of a group with usual intakes below the RI<sub>98</sub>
is inappropriate because it will always lead to an over&shy;esti&shy;mate of
the true preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quacy. By definition, the RI<sub>98</sub>
is set at 2SD above the AR, and thus exceeds the
require&shy;ments of more than 97% of all indi&shy;viduals in the group.
<p></p>
<b>Comparison of the group mean or median intake with the AR.</b> This is
inappropriate because even if the mean intake equals the AR,
a high pro&shy;portion of the population (&asymp;&nbsp;50%)
will be expected to have inade&shy;quate usual intakes
based on the definition of the AR.
<p></p>
<b>Comparison of the group mean or median intake with the RI<sub>98</sub>.
</b> This is inappropriate because it does
not take into account the wide variation in the distri&shy;bution
of usual intakes within the group, which almost always
exceeds the variability in the require&shy;ment distri&shy;bution. 
Hence, even if the
mean/median intake equals or even exceeds the RI<sub>98</sub>,
there may still be a substantial pro&shy;portion of the group
who will have intakes less than their own require&shy;ments,
as shown in Box&nbsp;8b.1. Indeed, to ensure a low preva&shy;lence
of intakes below the AR, the mean or median nutrient intakes of the
group should exceed the RI<sub>98</sub>, often by a considerable amount.
<p></p>
<b>Comparison of the usual intakes of indi&shy;viduals with the AI </b>.
This cannot be used to assess the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes.
<p></p>
<b>Comparison of the group mean or median intake with the AI.</b>
Provided the AI used has been set based
on the mean intake of a healthy population, then if the mean or
median intake of the group is at or above the AI,
the group can be assumed to have a low preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes.
However, if the mean or median intake of the group is
below the AI, it is not possible to make any assumptions
about the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quacy.

Note that in cases when the mean or median intake is
compared with the NRVs, the distri&shy;bution of nutrient
intakes does not need to be adjusted for day-to-day
variation because only the mean or median intake is being examined. However, 
the only situation in which this approach is appropriate is for nutrients with an AI
based on the mean/median intake of a healthy population, or for energy (see Section 8b.4.2).
<p></p>
When the objective is to compare the adequacy of nutrient intakes
for two groups, then the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes for each
group should be determined, and not the mean intake for each
group. The latter can be the same as shown in
<a href="#figure8b.2">Figure&nbsp;8b.2</a>,
even though there were differences in the pro&shy;portions in each group with
inade&shy;quate intakes. This situation occurs when the intakes in one

<p></p>
The recom&shy;mended approach for evaluating the adequacy of
nutrient intakes of population groups is to use the average
require&shy;ment (AR). Two methods based on the AR have been
developed: the full prob&shy;ability approach and the EAR cutpoint
method; they are described below. Neither of these methods
requires that the intakes be normally
distributed, although other assumptions described below must be
satisfied

<span data-tippy-content="Murphy, S. P., & Vorster, H. H. (2007). Methods for using nutrient intake values (NIVs) to assess or plan nutrient intakes. Food and nutrition bulletin, 28(1 Suppl International), S51&ndash;S60. ">

target="right" >Murphy and Vorster, 2007</a>).</span>	

<p></p>
Note that these methods cannot be used to identify actual
indi&shy;viduals with inade&shy;quate intakes because some of the
indi&shy;viduals will have require&shy;ments that are lower than the AR, and
others have higher than average require&shy;ments.

<h3 id="8b.3.1">8b.3.1 Full Probability Approach</h3>

The full prob&shy;ability approach was first described by Beaton

<span data-tippy-content="Beaton GH. (1972). The use of nutritional require&shy;ments and allowances. In: Proceedings of Western Hemisphere Nutrition Congress II. Futura Publishing Co. Mt. Kisco, NY, pp. 356-363.
&bull;&bull;&bull;NO PUBMED ENTRY&bull;&bull;&bull;">
(<a href="https://www.google.com"
target="right" >1972</a>),</span>	

with the goal of providing a more reliable esti&shy;mate for the
pro&shy;portion of indi&shy;viduals within a population group with 
inade&shy;quate intakes (i.e., intakes below their require&shy;ments). 
Because there is no infor&shy;mation about the
actual require&shy;ments of each indi&shy;vidual, this procedure does not
identify with certainty which indi&shy;viduals have inade&shy;quate intakes. 
Hence, it cannot be used to screen 
those indi&shy;viduals for nutrient inade&shy;quacy.
<p></p>
The statistical approach combines the distri&shy;butions
of both require&shy;ments and indi&shy;vidual usual nutrient
intakes for the group to esti&shy;mate the pro&shy;portion of
indi&shy;viduals with inade&shy;quate intakes. The probability
of inade&shy;quacy for each indi&shy;vidual in the group is calculated first,
followed by an esti&shy;mate of the average of the
indi&shy;vidual probabilities for the group.
This yields the group preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes.
The statistical approach is based on three key assumptions:
<ul class="padded">
<li>Intakes and require&shy;ments are independent
<li>The median and the variance of the distri&shy;bution of require&shy;ments are known
<li>The shape of the require&shy;ment distri&shy;bution follows
some known statistical model (normal, lognormal etc) (IOM, 2003).
</li>
</ul>
To adopt the probability approach for evaluating nutrient intakes, the following infor&shy;mation is required:
<ul class="padded">
<li>The AR for each nutrient for the particular sex and life-stage group of indi&shy;viduals.
<li>The distri&shy;bution of require&shy;ments for each nutrient
among similar indi&shy;viduals: for most nutrients,
this is not precisely known. In the absence of such
infor&shy;mation, the distri&shy;bution of require&shy;ments for
most nutrients is assumed to be normal with a
coefficient of variation of 10% (or 15% for niacin)
about the AR. Notable exceptions are the iron require&shy;ment
distri&shy;butions for men&shy;struating adolescent
women <span class="n">14&ndash;18y; </span>
and men&shy;struating adult women, both of which are positively skewed.
The iron require&shy;ment distri&shy;butions for children <span class="n">1&ndash;3y, </span>
and <span class="n">4&ndash;18y</span> are also esti&shy;mated by the US IOM

 to be skewed.
<li>Reliable data on the distri&shy;bution of usual
nutrient intakes for the group being assessed.
<li>Knowledge of the expected correlation between
intakes and require&shy;ments among indi&shy;viduals:
for all nutrients (except energy); this is assumed to be very low.
</li>
</ul>
Reliable infor&shy;mation on the distri&shy;bution of usual intakes
of the nutrient in the group can be obtained by
adjusting the distri&shy;bution of observed intakes
statistically in an attempt to partially remove the
effects of day-to-day variability in
intakes (i.e., within-person variation) (Chapters&nbsp;6).
This yields an adjusted intake distri&shy;bution, as discussed
in detail in Chapter 3; Section&nbsp;3.3.2.
Such an adjustment
can be applied, provided at least two independent
days or three consecutive days of dietary intake data
for a representative subsample of indi&shy;viduals
in the group, have been collected. Four statistical
methods are available for estimating the distri&shy;bution
of usual intakes. The methods have different features
which are summarized in Box&nbsp;3.3; Chapter&nbsp;3; Section&nbsp;3.3.2.

shows an example of observed (unadjusted) and
adjusted zinc intakes for a group of Malawian women. The
intakes were obtained from two independent 24h recalls from
each woman and adjusted to remove the effects of day-to-day
(within-person) variability in intake
following the procedure outlined in Chapter&nbsp;3. Note that
the adjust&shy;ment process has yielded a distri&shy;bution with the
same mean (6.6mg/d) but reduced variability. Note that any bias
arising from under- or over-reporting of food intakes is not
removed by this adjust&shy;ment process.
<p></p>
In this statistical approach, a prob&shy;ability of inade&shy;quacy can be
calculated for any level of usual intake because infor&shy;mation on the
distri&shy;bution of require&shy;ments for the
group is known. Inade&shy;quate intakes associated with the
usual intake of each indi&shy;vidual in the group is determined first,
followed by the average for the group
as a whole. The latter is esti&shy;mated as 
the weighted average of inade&shy;quate intakes
for each indi&shy;vidual, as outlined below

(column&nbsp;A). The number of indi&shy;viduals with
intakes of the nutrient within each class is then
determined; this number is then multiplied by the appropriate
prob&shy;ability for each class (<a href="#table8b.5">Table&nbsp;8b.5</a>, column&nbsp;B) to give the number
of indi&shy;viduals per class who were likely
to have intakes below their own require&shy;ments. The numerical
prob&shy;abilities are derived from the area beneath the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; curve
between the stated SD&nbsp;limits. The sum of
the numbers in the six classes gives the total number of indi&shy;viduals in the
population group with inade&shy;quate intakes for the
nutrient. This sum can be expressed as a percentage of
the total population group to give a prob&shy;ability esti&shy;mate for the
population group as a whole. For example, assume that in a
population group of  n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4600, the numbers of
indi&shy;viduals with usual intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C within classes one to
six, respectively, are 300, 500, 800, 900, 1400, and 700. When
multiplied by the appropriate prob&shy;abilities for each
class (<a href="#table8b.5">Table&nbsp;8b.5</a>, column&nbsp;B), the number of indi&shy;viduals per class
likely to have vitamin&nbsp;C intakes below their own require&shy;ments
becomes 300, 465, 552, 279, 98, and 0. The sum of
these numbers equals 1694, and this represents the total number of
indi&shy;viduals with inade&shy;quate intakes for vitamin&nbsp;C.
When expressed as a percentage, 37% of the
total population are predicted to have intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C below
their own require&shy;ments.

The full prob&shy;ability approach must be used for assessing the
preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes of iron for women between 
the ages of menarche and menopause 
because the distri&shy;bution of iron require&shy;ments for this life-stage
group is highly skewed: some women have high menstrual iron
losses. Calculations can be performed by using one of the four
computer programs itemized in Box 3.3&nbsp;
Chapter&nbsp;3; Section&nbsp;3.3.2. Alternatively,
for iron a spread&shy;sheet can be used for these calculations in
conjunction with tabulated data
presented in Gibson and Ferguson (2008), provided the distri&shy;bution of
observed intakes have been adjusted statistically to yield
infor&shy;mation on the usual intakes.  See:

have been made).

<h3 id="8b.3.2">8b.3.2 EAR Cutpoint Method</h3>

A shortcut to the prob&shy;ability approach has been devel&shy;oped by Beaton

<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine (US) Subcommittee on Interpretation and Uses of Dietary Reference Intakes, & Institute of Medicine (US) Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes. (2000). DRI Dietary Reference Intakes: Applications in Dietary Assessment. National Academies Press (US).">
(<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/9956/dietary-reference-intakes-applications-in-dietary-assessment"
target="right" >IOM, 2000</a>)</span>

for assessing the pro&shy;portion of inade&shy;quate intakes in a
group. This simpler version is termed the EAR cutpoint method
and does not require infor&shy;mation on the exact require&shy;ment
distri&shy;bution. The EAR cutpoint method can be used, providing the
following three con&shy;ditions are met:
<ul class="padded">
<li>Intakes and require&shy;ments of the nutrient are independent
(assumed to be true for all nutrients, but is not true for energy).
<li>The distri&shy;bution of intakes in the population group must be
more variable than the distri&shy;bution of require&shy;ments (which
is generally the case in free-living Individuals).
<li>The distri&shy;bution of require&shy;ments in the group is approx&shy;imately
symmetrical about the AR (but this is not the case for the iron
require&shy;ments of children aged 1 to 8y or women between the ages of 
menarche and menopause).
</li></ul>
<p></p>
Again, data on the usual nutrient intakes are required, and these are
best obtained by statistically adjusting the observed intakes for
day-to-day variation (i.e., within-person variation), as discussed in
Chapter&nbsp;3. In this simplified version,
the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes within the group is
simply esti&shy;mated by counting the number of indi&shy;viduals in the
group with usual intakes below the AR, instead of estimating 
the level of inade&shy;quate intakes of each indi&shy;vidual
separately. This preva&shy;lence is represented by the shaded area to the
left of the AR under the curve showing the distri&shy;bution of usual
intakes, as shown in
<a href="#figure8b.4">Figure&nbsp;8b.4</a>.
<a id="figure8b.4"></a>

The larger area to the right of the
AR represents the majority with usual intakes above the AR.
Further theoretical justification for this approach can be found in Carriquiry

<span data-tippy-content="Carriquiry A. L. (1999). Assessing the preva&shy;lence of nutrient inade&shy;quacy. Public health nutrition, 2(1), 23&ndash;33.">

 and IOM

<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine (US) Subcommittee on Interpretation and Uses of Dietary Reference Intakes, & Institute of Medicine (US) Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes. (2003). Dietary Reference Intakes: Applications in Dietary Planning. National Academies Press (US).">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25057648/"
target="right" >2003</a>).</span>
<p></p>


This EAR cutpoint method is especially useful when the actual
preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes in the group is close to 50%. As
the true preva&shy;lence approaches zero, or 100%, the performance of
this method declines, even if the con&shy;ditions listed above are met.

method for estimating the pro&shy;portion of indi&shy;viduals
with intakes below the AR.
</figcaption>
</figure>

In
addition, in circum&shy;stances when the variability in intakes is very
low, as may occur for groups fed similar diets, then the full
prob&shy;ability approach should be used instead of the EAR cutpoint
method.  Some examples of simulations used to assess the
performance of the EAR cutpoint method in different situations are
given in

<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine (US) Subcommittee on Interpretation and Uses of Dietary Reference Intakes, & Institute of Medicine (US) Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes.

<p></p>
Currently, the EAR cutpoint method based on the U.S Food and
Nutrition Board Dietary Reference Intakes (NRVs equiv&shy;alent) can be applied to assess
the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes among population subgroups
for the following nutrients: calcium, copper, iodine, magnesium,
molybdenum, phosphorus, selenium, zinc, thiamin, riboflavin,
niacin, vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub>, folate, vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>, vitamin&nbsp;C, vitamin&nbsp;A,
vitamin&nbsp;D, and vitamin&nbsp;E (<a href="#table8b.6">Table&nbsp;8b.6</a>).
As noted earlier the EAR cutpoint method cannot be used for
assessing iron intakes for men&shy;struating adolescents aged
<span class="n">14&ndash;18y</span> and
men&shy;struating women because their distri&shy;bution of iron
require&shy;ments is skewed, although it can be used with these
groups for the other nutrients listed above.
<p></p>
The EAR cutpoint method has been used to identify nutrients of
con&shy;cern when revising the USDA food assistance programs
based on US national survey data

<h3 id="8b.3.3">8b.3.3   Using 77% Percent of the Recommended Intake (RI<sub>98</sub>) as a Cutoff Value</h3>

In some tables of NRVs, esti&shy;mated average require&shy;ments (i.e, ARs)
for nutrients are not specified, as noted earlier.  In such cases,
approximations for the esti&shy;mated
average require&shy;ments can be calculated,
provided the RI (or equiv&shy;alent) for
each nutrient approx&shy;imates the mean require&shy;ment esti&shy;mate plus
two standard deviations, with a specified
coefficient of variation (i.e., RI<sub>98</sub>)

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25032431/"
target="right" >NRC, 1986</a>).</span>	

The pro&shy;portion of the population with usual intakes
below the derived AR is then calculated, as described in
<a href="#8b.3.2">Section&nbsp;8b.3.2</a>.
<p></p>
A cutoff value of 77% of the RI is sometimes used. This
approach assumes a CV for the nutrient of 15% about the AR.
Such an assumption will yield a con&shy;servative esti&shy;mate of nutrient
inade&shy;quacy compared to that based on a CV for the nutrient of
10% about the AR. Use of the latter CV corres&shy;ponds to a cutoff of
approx&shy;imately 83% of the RI instead of 77%; hence, it will yield
a larger percentage of the group likely to have
inade&shy;quate intakes. Briefel et&nbsp;al.

iron for adolescent girls, men&shy;struating women
<span class="n">(19&ndash;50y),</span> or
children (&lt;&nbsp;9y) because of the
skewed distri&shy;bution of require&shy;ments
for iron for these groups. The con&shy;version factors that have been
used in WHO (2006) to calculate the WHO/FAO ARs are based on standard
deviations derived by the U.S Food and Nutrition Board of the
Institute of Medicine and used to calculate the U.S and Canadian
Recom&shy;mended Dietary Allowances (RI equiv&shy;alent).

<h3 id="8b.3.4">8b.3.4 Use of Adequate Intake</h3>

The Adequate Intake (AI) is esti&shy;mated in a number of different ways, depending on
the nutrient and the life stage group.
When the AI has been set  based on the mean intake of a
healthy population, then
if the study group's mean intake is at or above the AI, the group
can be assumed to have a low preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes
(<a href="#table8b.1">Table&nbsp;8b.1</a>),
although the actual
preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes
cannot be established. When the AI is used in this way, the
distri&shy;bution of intakes does not have to be adjusted for within-person 
variation because only the mean or median intake is being examined for
comparison. However, no assumptions can be made about the
preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes when the mean or median intake of a group
falls below the AI because the distri&shy;bution of require&shy;ments is
unknown

<h3 id="8b.3.5">8b.3.5 Use of Upper Intake Level</h3>

When any comparison is made with the Upper Intake Level (UL), it is important to note
if the UL assess&shy;ment for the
nutrient of interest is based on infor&shy;mation on usual daily intakes
from all sources or only from supplements, fortificants, and
medications. The preva&shy;lence of potentially excessive intakes is esti&shy;mated
by assessing the pro&shy;portion of the group with usual intakes above the UL.
The goal is to have a low pro&shy;portion of a group with intakes above the UL

<span data-tippy-content="Barr, S. I., Murphy, S. P., & Poos, M. I. (2002). Interpreting and using the dietary references intakes in dietary assessment of indi&shy;viduals and groups. Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 102(6), 780&ndash;788.">

Before an
assess&shy;ment is made, the intake distri&shy;bution must be

Because of the uncertainties and the variability in indi&shy;vidual
sensitivities to the adverse effects, the actual preva&shy;lence of adverse
health effects in the group will seldom be equal to the pro&shy;portion

<h3 id="8b.3.6">8b.3.6 Energy Intakes</h3>

As noted for indi&shy;viduals
(<a href="#8b.2.6">Section&nbsp;8b.2.6</a>),
the prob&shy;ability approach cannot be used
to esti&shy;mate the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate or excessive intakes of
energy in a group because of the expected high correlation
between energy intake and energy require&shy;ments among
indi&shy;viduals. The latter violates one of the assumptions required for
the adoption of the prob&shy;ability approach. Instead, the group mean
energy intake can be compared with the mean esti&shy;mated energy
require&shy;ment (EER) for the group, taking into account the ages,
sexes, heights, weights, and physical activity levels of the indi&shy;viduals in the group.
If the mean intake is equal to the mean EER, energy intake can
assumed to be ade&shy;quate, whereas if the mean intake exceeds or
falls below the EER, then the group on average is likely to be
gaining or losing weight, respectively. Again, because only the
mean is calculated, the intake distri&shy;bution does not need to be
adjusted for within-person variation in intakes, as noted for the AI
(<a href="#8b.3.4">Section&nbsp;8b.3.4</a>).
<p></p>
Alternatively, as under-reporting of energy intake in dietary
assess&shy;ment is ubiquitous, the adequacy of the group's energy
intake can also be assessed using the body mass index (BMI). The
pro&shy;portion of a group of U.S adults with a BMI
below or above the normal range of
<span class="n">18.5&ndash;25kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> would be
classified as having inade&shy;quate or excessive energy intakes, respectively for
their activity level, whereas for U.S children and
adolescents, the pro&shy;portion with BMI-for-age &lt;&nbsp;5<sup>th</sup> percentile or 
&ge;&nbsp;85<sup>th</sup> percentile should be used

<h3 id="8b.3.7">8b.3.7   Macro&shy;nutrient Intakes</h3>

For macro&shy;nutrients with a reference intake range, the pro&shy;portion of
the group with usual intakes (adjusted for within-person day-to-day variation)
outside the AMDR can be assessed. If the preva&shy;lence outside the
range is high, then an inter&shy;vention may be needed.

<h2 id="8b.4">8b.4 Using the NRVs for planning nutritious diets</h2>

As shown in  <a href="#figure8b.1">Figure&nbsp;8b.1</a>,
NRVs can also be used to plan diets at
the indi&shy;vidual or group level.  Planning for an indi&shy;vidual involves
setting intake targets that ensure a nutritionally ade&shy;quate diet,
while also being acceptable, whereas for a group, the goal is to
determine a desirable intake distri&shy;bution that minimizes the
preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate or excessive intakes. Numerous
applications for planning nutritious diets exist, including dietary counseling
for indi&shy;viduals, developing menus for institutions, or designing inter&shy;ventions
for high-risk groups, as shown in
<a href="#table8b.2">Table&nbsp;8b.2</a>.

<h3 id="8b.4.1">8b.4.1 Using the NRVs for planning nutritious
diets of indi&shy;viduals</h3>

The goal of planning a diet for an indi&shy;vidual is to ensure there is a
low prob&shy;ability of inade&shy;quacy and the potential risk of an excessive
intake is small. This can be achieved by ensuring that the usual
intake of the indi&shy;vidual meets the RI<sub>98</sub>, because by definition, the
intake at that level should be ade&shy;quate for almost all (98%)
indi&shy;viduals. Use of the AR as a goal for the nutrient intake of an
indi&shy;vidual is not appropriate because an intake at this level would
be ade&shy;quate for only 50% of indi&shy;viduals. When setting the RI<sub>98</sub>,
however, knowledge about the distri&shy;bution of require&shy;ments for
many nutrients remains limited, so an assumption about the
coefficient of variation of the require&shy;ment is often made, as noted
in Chapter&nbsp;8a. This has led to debate over the use of the RI<sub>98</sub> as the
goal for planning diets at the indi&shy;vidual level

<span data-tippy-content="Beaton G. H. (2006). When is an indi&shy;vidual an indi&shy;vidual versus a member of a group? An issue in the application of the dietary reference intakes. Nutrition reviews, 64(5 Pt 1), 211&ndash;225. ">

Nevertheless, at present the RI<sub>98</sub> remains the most appropriate
target for the nutrient intake for indi&shy;viduals, at least until more
accurate data on the require&shy;ment distri&shy;butions are available.
<p></p>
To avoid a potential risk of adverse effects, the nutrient intakes of
an indi&shy;vidual should not exceed the UL. This means that the diet of
an indi&shy;vidual should have usual nutrient intakes that fall between
the RI<sub>98</sub> and the UL. For those nutrients with only an AI, then
nutrient intakes for an indi&shy;vidual should fall between the AI and
the UL.
<p></p>
Planning for an indi&shy;vidual's energy intake is unlike other nutrients. 
For most nutrients, there is essentially no risk if an 
indi&shy;vidual consumes an intake that may marginally exceed 
his or her require&shy;ment (i.e., the RI<sub>98</sub> exceeds the require&shy;ments of 
almost all (97&ndash;98%) indi&shy;viduals in a group).  
However, in the case of energy, consuming an energy intake 
that met the require&shy;ments of 97&ndash;98% of a group would lead to 
weight gain in that proportion of indi&shy;viduals.  
Accordingly, energy require&shy;ments of indi&shy;viduals are best 
monitored by assessing their 
body weight status &mdash; those with BMI in the
normal range who are maintaining their weight 
(or gaining weight appropriately during growth) are considered to be 
meeting their energy require&shy;ment.  If an esti&shy;mate of energy needs 
is required for planning purposes, 
an approximation can be provided by 
using the equations for EER, 
which consider age, sex, height, weight and physical activity level.  
However, because there is variability in energy require&shy;ments 
even among indi&shy;viduals with the same characteristics, body weight 
must be monitored and intake adjusted where necessary

target="right" >Barr et&nbsp;al., 2003</a>).</span>	
For macro&shy;nutrients (expressed as percentage of energy),
the goal is to ensure that the intakes from the indi&shy;vidual's diet
falls within the AMDR ranges.

Planning a nutritious diet at the indi&shy;vidual level may involve
counseling indi&shy;viduals with special needs such as vegetarians and
athletes, or those requiring therapeutic diets, as well as providing
food-based dietary guidance.
<a href="#table8b.8">Table&nbsp;8b.8</a> provides an example of
how to plan to change the nutrient intakes of a hypothetical
30y male indi&shy;vidual. In this example, provided the three days
of intake collected represented his usual intake, the indi&shy;vidual has
been advised to increase his intake of both riboflavin and zinc so
that they meet the RI<sub>98</sub>; no other changes were needed as none of the
intakes exceeded the UL (<a href="#table8b.8">Table&nbsp;8b.8</a>).
Note that in this example, the evaluation of the indi&shy;vidual's nutrient intake 
was conducted using the more practical qualitative approach 
described in 8b.2.4, rather than the statistical approaches 
described in 8b.2.1 through 8b.2.3.


<h3 id="8b.4.2">8b.4.2 Using NRVs for planning nutritious
diets for groups</h3>

Planning diets for groups is more complex than for indi&shy;viduals
because of the wide range of nutrient intakes in a group arising
from differences in the amount and types of food con&shy;sumed. The
goal is to alter the distri&shy;bution of current nutrient intakes within the
group to reduce the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate and excessive
intakes, where necessary. The three NRVs used for planning
nutrient intakes for a group are the AR, the AI, and the UL; the
RI<sub>98</sub> should not be used for groups.
For more details on planning diets for groups, the reader is
referred to IOM (2003) and Murphy and Barr (2005).
<p></p>
The EAR cutpoint method described in
<a href="#8b.3.2">Section&nbsp;8b.3.2</a> is also used for
planning the diets of groups, with the goal of minimizing the
pro&shy;portion of the group with intakes below the AR and above the UL.
Steps in planning diets for groups, using the EAR cutpoint method
are shown in Box&nbsp;8b.2.
The method can only be used for those nutrients with a
defined AR and UL, and for which the require&shy;ment distri&shy;bution is
approx&shy;imately symmetrical.

<p></p>
<div class="box"><b>Box&nbsp;8b.2. The four steps involved in planning diets for groups using the
EAR cutpoint method</b>
<ol>
<li class="numbered">
Decide on the goals of the planning process. This
involves deciding on what is con&shy;sidered an acceptable, practical,
and low preva&shy;lence of undesirable intakes (i.e., inade&shy;quate intakes
below the AR and excessive intakes above the UL) given the
situation. The acceptable preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quacy is often
<span class="n">2&ndash;3%,</span> although this may not always be practical.
<li class="numbered">
Select the target distri&shy;bution of usual intakes that meets
the defined goals. This means that knowledge of the current intake
distri&shy;butions for the nutrients of con&shy;cern is already available. A
change may be required for only certain nutrients to either increase
the intakes (i.e., move the current distri&shy;bution to the right) so that
fewer people have intakes for those nutrients below the AR, or
decrease intakes (move the current distri&shy;bution to the left) so fewer
people have intakes above the UL.
<li class="numbered">
Plan a menu to achieve the goals for all of the nutrients
of con&shy;cern. To accomplish this step, first the nutrient con&shy;tent of the
menus must be calculated using appropriate dietary assess&shy;ment
software and food composition data, and taking into account the
foods and amounts that will be actually con&shy;sumed rather than those
provided by the menus. The goal here might be for the menu to
provide nutrient levels at the midpoint of the target distri&shy;bution for
each nutrient of con&shy;cern.
<li class="numbered">
Assess the results following the implementation of the
new menu. This stage involves collecting dietary data from the
group of interest, calculating their nutrient intakes, and comparing
the usual intake distri&shy;butions for the nutrients of interest to the
goals set in step 1.  If the planning goals have not been met, then
some or all of the steps may need to be repeated until the results
are satisfactory.

As noted earlier, because iron require&shy;ments
for certain life-stage groups are skewed, the full prob&shy;ability
approach must be used to calculate the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate or
excessive intakes for these groups using software described earlier
(Chapter&nbsp;3; Section&nbsp;3.3.2). Alternatively, published tables of the distri&shy;bution
of iron require&shy;ments can be used to esti&shy;mate manually the
prob&shy;ability of inade&shy;quacy for each indi&shy;vidual within the group,
from which the prob&shy;ability of inade&shy;quacy for the whole
group can be calculated; refer to
<a href="#8b.3.1">Section&nbsp;8b.3.1</a>
for more details.
<p></p>
Note that irrespective of which method is used, the distri&shy;butions of
observed intakes, both before and after the intervention,
must always be adjusted statistically to yield the
usual intake distri&shy;bution and thus remove the effects of day-to-day
variations; see Chapter&nbsp;3 for details of the statistical techniques to use.
<p></p>
When only an AI has been set for a nutrient, it is not possible to
esti&shy;mate the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes in the group for that
nutrient, and instead the goal is to ensure that the average intake of
the group for that nutrient is at or above the AI.

When planning the energy intakes of groups, the goal is for the
mean intake of the group to be approx&shy;imately equal to the EER.
The latter represents the average energy require&shy;ment for the group.
No RI<sub>98</sub> is set for energy because intakes above require&shy;ments lead
to weight gain.

intakes

<h4>Example of the process for planning zinc intakes using the EAR cut-point method</h4>
<p></p>

In the example shown in <a href="#table8b.9">Table&nbsp;8b.9</a>, the first step is to
select the planning goal, which in this example will be to
have no more than
<span class="n">2&ndash;3%</span> of girls aged
<span class="n">9&ndash;13y</span> to
have usual zinc intakes less than the AR (i.e.,&nbsp;7mg) and
no more than
<span class="n">2&ndash;3%</span> above
the UL (i.e.,&nbsp;23mg/d).  Step&nbsp;2
is to esti&shy;mate the target intake distri&shy;bution.  To
complete this step, infor&shy;mation on the current intake
distri&shy;bution for zinc is needed.   In this example,
data on the usual zinc intake
distri&shy;bution of girls aged
<span class="n">9&ndash;13y</span> from NHANES&nbsp;III
is used
(<a href="#table8b.9">Table&nbsp;8b.9</a>).
Note that the esti&shy;mated preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate intakes
based on this current intake distri&shy;bution is 9%, above the
goal of no more than
<span class="n">2&ndash;3%</span> below the AR. Note also
that the AR for zinc of 7mg approx&shy;imates the 10th
percentile of the current usual intake distri&shy;bution. Hence,
assuming our planning goal is to reduce the preva&shy;lence of
inade&shy;quate intakes to 2%, then the distri&shy;bution of usual
intake needs to be shifted such that the current intake at
the 2nd percentile (currently 6.2mg/d) is increased to
corres&shy;pond to the AR of 7mg. Thus, an increase of 0.8mg
is needed, and assuming that the shape of the
distri&shy;bution does not change, then intake at every
percentile would also increase by 0.8mg/d. This would
yield a target median intake of 9.4 &plus; 0.8 &equals; 10.2mg as
shown in <a href="#table8b.9">Table&nbsp;8b.9</a>.

shifted upwards so that the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate
intakes (% &lt;&nbsp;AR) is now only 2% (shaded green).

<p></p>
The next step is to plan a menu to meet the target intake
distri&shy;bution, which in this example could be achieved by
substituting some of the foods currently con&shy;sumed with
those higher in zinc, recognizing that not all food will be
con&shy;sumed. In the final step, the effect of the new
menu is examined. This can be achieved by collecting
dietary intake data from each girl in the group,
calculating zinc intakes, and after adjust&shy;ing the
distri&shy;bution of observed intakes to usual zinc intakes,
estimating the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate and possible
excessive intakes. If the planning goal of 2% with intakes
below the AR has not been met, then a new plan will be
required.
<p></p>
In this example only zinc is con&shy;sidered whereas in
practice intakes of all nut&shy;rients would be con&shy;&shy;sidered. The
planner then has the task of deciding which of the
nut&shy;rient intakes need to change necessitating the use of a
nut&shy;rient calculation software package.
The nutrient profiles of the proposed menus can be calculated
using the software, so that the necessity of further changes can be assessed.

Health Canada followed the process outlined above when planning
diets for their publication entitled &ldquo;Eating Well with Canada's
Food Guide&rdquo;

<span data-tippy-content="Health Canada. (2011). Eating well with Canada’s Food Guide">
(<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjH-NKuu8jvAhW74jgGHcVQDAIQFjAVegQIERAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hc-sc.gc.ca%2Ffn-an%2Falt_formats%2Fhpfb-dgpsa%2Fpdf%2Ffood-guide-aliment%2Fview_eatwell_vue_bienmang-eng.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0yDyDC0phoh_rnBxEGc80z"

Their goal was to ensure a
low preva&shy;lence of nutrient intakes below the AR
when a life-stage and sex group
chooses foods from food groups following the
recom&shy;mended dietary pattern; see Katamay et al. 
<span data-tippy-content="Katamay, S. W., Esslinger, K. A., Vigneault, M., Johnston, J. L., Junkins, B. A., Robbins, L. G., … Martineau, C. (2008). Eating Well with Canada’s Food Guide (2007): Development of the Food Intake Pattern. Nutrition Reviews, 65(4), 155&ndash;166. ">

target="right" >2007</a>)</span>	
for more details of the methods applied.
However, the process to develop the subsequent Canadian Food Guide, 
released in 2019, did not include a comparable assessment 
of the nutrient adequacy of the recommended dietary pattern 

<span data-tippy-content="Barr S. I. (2019). Is the 2019 Canada's Food Guide Snapshot nutritionally ade&shy;quate?. Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism,  Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme, 44(12), 1387&ndash;1390. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31657222/"
target="right" >Barr, 2019</a>).</span>	

A modification of this approach has
also been used in the U.S to identify nutrient targets for school
meals

<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Nutrition Standards for National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, Stallings, V. A., West Suitor, C., & Taylor, C. L. (Eds.). (2010). School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children. National Academies Press (US).">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25032362/"
target="right" >IOM, 2010b</a>).</span>	

<p></p>
There are several other challenges that may be encountered when
planning diets for groups. These are summarized in Murphy and Barr

<span data-tippy-content="Murphy, S. P., & Barr, S. I. (2005). Challenges in using the dietary reference intakes to plan diets for groups. Nutrition reviews, 63(8), 267&ndash;271. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16190313/"
target="right" >2005</a>)</span>	

and discussed in more detail in IOM

<span data-tippy-content="IOM (Institute of Medicine). (2003).  Dietary Reference Intakes: Applications in dietary planning.  Washington, DC: National Academies Press, Washington, DC. ">
(<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjFpbimw8jvAhWXwTgGHQfBCKEQFjADegQIBxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nal.usda.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Ffnic_uploads%2F%2Fdietary_planning_full_report.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2dl0Aqt3Q6q1wtKYHqEifp"
target="right" >2003</a>).</span>	

As an example, all the approaches described above for planning
diets for groups assume that the age and sex of the indi&shy;viduals
within the group are similar, thus permitting a single set of ARs
and ULs to be applied. However, in some circum&shy;stances, groups
are hetero&shy;geneous making the planning process more challenging.
Currently the recom&shy;mended approach for hetero&shy;geneous groups is
to first identify the subgroup with the greatest nutrient require&shy;ment
per 1,000kcal (i.e., nutrient density) and second, apply the
approaches described above to plan the intakes for each nutrient.
Here care must be taken to ensure that no subgroups within the
group have the potential for excessive intakes. Finally, after the
new menus or food patterns have been implemented, then the
actual nutrient intake distri&shy;butions must be checked to ensure that
the preva&shy;lence of inade&shy;quate and potentially excessive intakes
remains low.
<p></p>
Applications for groups include planning diets for institutional
feeding such as school lunch programs, residential schools,
hospitals, prisons, nursing homes, the military etc, and in some
cases, emergency food assistance programs

<span data-tippy-content="Murphy, S. P., & Barr, S. I. (2005). Challenges in using the dietary reference intakes to plan diets for groups. Nutrition reviews, 63(8), 267&ndash;271. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16190313/"
target="right" >Murphy and Barr, 2005</a>).</span>		

The approach is also used for establishing appropriate levels
of nutrient fortification of foods and described in detail in WHO

<span data-tippy-content="WHO (World Health Organization). (2006). Guidelines on food fortification with micronutrients, (Allen L, de Benoist B, Dary O, Hurrell R. Eds).">
