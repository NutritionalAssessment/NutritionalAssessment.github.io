<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

Nutrient intakes calculated from food composition data or determined by 
direct chemical analysis represent the maximum available to the body and 
not the amount actually absorbed and utilized. Algorithms have been developed 
for those nutrients for which the factors affecting their bioavail&shy;ability 
are well characterized.  Use of these algorithms allows a more reliable 
assessment of the nutrient adequacy of diets. The earlier algorithms for 
iron were developed from results of single meal absorption studies now 
recognized to exaggerate the effects of dietary modifiers on iron absorption. 
In addition, only the effect of selected dietary modifiers on nonheme 
iron absorption were considered, with a value of 25% assumed for heme 
iron absorption. Most recently, an interactive tool based on the 
probability-based approach has been developed whereby total iron absorption 
from mixed diets of adults at any level of iron status can be estimated.
The newest quantitative zinc algorithms use the trivariate saturation 
response model to estimate total absorbable zinc for adults, 
provided intakes of zinc and phytate (a major inhibitor of zinc 
absorption), are available. Whether these new models are appropriate 
for young children is uncertain. New terms have been introduced for 
protein (digestible indispensable amino acid 
score), folate (dietary folate equivalent), and vitamin&nbsp;A (retinol activity coefficient) 
to consider the differences in the bioavail&shy;ability of all 
sources of these nutrients. However, some uncertainty exists on the 
bioavail&shy;ability for the different forms of vitamin&nbsp;D and vitamin&nbsp;E. 
Currently, both vitamin&nbsp;D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) 
are considered bioequivalent, whereas of the 8 naturally occurring 
vitamin&nbsp;E analogues, only &alpha;-toco&shy;pherol is considered by some authoritative 
groups when measuring vitamin&nbsp;E intake and setting requirements.

<h3> 4b.0  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment of bioavailable nutrient intakes</h3>

Nutrient intakes calculated from food composition data or determined by direct chemical 
analysis represent the maximum amount of nutrient available to the body. For most nutrients, 
however, the amount actually absorbed and used by the body is lower than the total intake. The 
term “bioavail&shy;ability” is defined as the proportion of the ingested nutrient that is absorbed from 
the diet and utilized for normal body functions (Chapt17, section 17.1.7,

Nutrients that are readily taken up following ingestion are termed “bioavailable.” 
<p></p>
With the increasing use of food fortification / enrichment and dietary supplements worldwide, 
care must be taken to ensure that the bioavail&shy;ability (as well as the amount) of any potential 
fortificant and supplement in the food supply of a country is also considered, so their 
contributions can be taken into account when estimating the nutrient composition and 
bioavail&shy;ability of the total diet. However, because the level of fortification/enrichment is 
country-specific due to different food standards in each country, caution must be used if food 
composition values are borrowed from other countries.  
<p></p>
Depending on the nutrient, bioavail&shy;ability may be influenced by diet and host-related factors  
independently and in combination. In general, diet-related factors have less influence on the 
bioavail&shy;ability of the macronutrients than micronutrients. Examples of dietary factors include the 
chemical form of the nutrient and nature of the dietary matrix, interactions among nutrients 
themselves or with other organic components in the diet, and pretreatment of food from 
processing and/or preparation practices. At present, the dietary factors influencing the 
bioavail&shy;ability of many nutrients are not well established

<span data-tippy-content="Gibson RS. The role of diet- and 
host-related factors in nutrient bioavail&shy;ability and thus in nutrient-based dietary 
requirement estimates. Food Nutr Bull. 2007 Mar;28(1 Suppl International):S77-100.">

<p></p>
Information on the host-related factors is often limited, so their effects on nutrient bioavail&shy;ability 
are often ignored. Moreover, the extent to which host-related factors influence absorption and/or 
utilization varies with the nutrient, life-stage group, and environment. Host-related factors are 
often classified as intestinal or systemic factors.  Intestinal factors influence the efficiency of 
luminal and mucosal digestion and absorption through reductions in the secretion of hydrochloric 
acid, gastric acid, and intrinsic factor, as well as from alterations in the permeability of the 
intestinal mucosa.  Of these, atrophic gastritis is considered one of the most significant luminal 
factors influencing nutrient bioavail&shy;ability, mainly through its association with hypochlorhydria. 
The latter is characterized by a progressive decrease in the capacity of the parietal cells of the 
stomach to secrete hydrochloric acid. In children in low-income countries, hypochlorhydria often 
arises from infection with the bacterium <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>. As a result of the hypochlorhydria, 
absorption of folate, iron, calcium, and zinc, and 
the bioconversion of &beta;&#8209;carotene to vitamin&nbsp;A 
may be impaired 

<span data-tippy-content="Gibson RS. The role of diet- and 
host-related factors in nutrient bioavail&shy;ability and thus in nutrient-based dietary 
requirement estimates. Food Nutr Bull. 2007 Mar;28(1 Suppl International):S77-100.">

	target="right" >Gibson, 2007</a>).</span>

<p></p>
Bacterial overgrowth in the proximal small intestine also occurs with atrophic gastritis.  This 
condition often exacerbates vitamin&nbsp;B12 deficiency because the bacteria may take up any freed 
vitamin&nbsp;B12 from food. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is also a manifestation of 
environmental enteropathy (EE) (also known as environmental enteric dysfunction (EED). EE/EED is an 
acquired subclinical condition predominantly affecting the gut of children in low-income 
countries. EE/EED is hypothesized to be caused from continuous exposure to fecally 
contaminated food and water and is characterized by multiple abnormalities. These may include 
loss of intestinal barrier function and low-grade intestinal inflammation, which together result in 
atrophy of the villi of the small intestine.  Increasingly, linear growth faltering, poor 
neurocognitive development, and oral vaccine low efficacy is being associated with EE/EED in 
childhood

<p></p>
Of the systemic factors that can influence absorption and utilization of nutrients, age, 
physiological status (e.g., pregnancy or lactation), and nutrient status of the host are those most 
frequently considered. Coexisting infectious illnesses also impact the bioavail&shy;ability of nutrients 
through several mechanisms, including decreased absorption, increased losses, and sequestration  
of nutrients in the liver or other sites. There is also increasing evidence that the absorption of 
certain nutrients may also be affected by ethnicity, lifestyle (e.g., smokers, oral contraceptive 
users), genotype, environmental pollution (e.g., lead pollution) and chronic disease (e.g., asthma, 
diabetes

	target="right" >2007</a>).</span>

<p></p>
For some nutrients, mathematical models termed algorithms have been developed to predict 
nutrient bioavail&shy;ability. These mathematical models attempt to predict bioavail&shy;ability by 
considering the amount and form of the nutrient (where applicable), the presence of dietary 
enhancers and inhibitors, and in some cases, the nutrient and health status of the individual. The 
models then apply certain general principles to the complex whole-diet matrix. Unfortunately, 
for many nutrients, algorithms have not been developed to predict bioavail&shy;ability due to the 
paucity of data. Notable exceptions are the algorithms available for iron, zinc, protein, folate, 
vitamin&nbsp;A, and vitamin&nbsp;E. Clearly, many factors can limit the accuracy of the algorithms 

<span data-tippy-content="Hunt JR. Algorithms for iron and zinc bioavail&shy;ability: 
are they accurate? Int J Vitam Nutr Res. 2010 Oct;80(4-5):257-62. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21462108/"
target="right" >Hunt, 2010</a>).</span>

Hence, as new research findings emerge, algorithms must be modified on an ongoing 
basis. Currently, the effects of only some of the dietary modifiers and host-related factors are 
considered in the bioavail&shy;ability algorithms available.

<h3> 4b.1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bioavail&shy;ability of iron</h3>

Two forms of iron are present in foods: heme iron and nonheme iron. Heme iron is bound in a 
porphyrin ring and is derived mainly from hemoglobin and myoglobin in meat, poultry, and fish. 
The proportion of heme iron in lean meat, poultry and fish is variable and ranges from about&nbsp;30% in 
white meats to about&nbsp;70% in red meats. In individuals consuming omnivorous diets, heme iron 
contributes only about 10&#8209; of the total iron consumed, but because of its efficient absorption, 
it can provide over 40% of the total iron absorbed

<span data-tippy-content="Hurrell R, Egli I. Iron bioavail&shy;ability and dietary 
reference values. Am J Clin Nutr. 2010 May;91(5):1461S-1467S. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21462108/"
target="right" >Hurrell & Egli, 2010</a>).</span>

Nonheme iron is 
found primarily as iron salts in a variety of foods of both plant and animal origin, and possibly as  
contaminant iron introduced by food processing and the soil 

<span data-tippy-content="Harvey PW, Dexter PB, 
Darnton-Hill I. The impact of consuming iron from non-food sources

Each form of iron is absorbed by separate pathways; heme iron is absorbed as the intact 
iron porphyrin, whereas nonheme iron is absorbed from the common pool within the 
gastrointestinal tract. However, once inside the mucosal cells of the small intestine, all iron 
enters a common pool 

<span data-tippy-content="Hurrell R, Egli I. Iron bioavail&shy;ability and dietary 
reference values. Am J Clin Nutr. 2010 May;91(5):1461S-1467S. ">

<p></p>
Of the two dietary iron forms, heme iron is much more readily absorbed than nonheme iron, with 
absorption ranging from 10-40%, depending on the iron status of the individual, compared to 
2&#8209;20% for nonheme iron. Absorption of heme iron is little affected by dietary factors; absorption is 
regulated primarily in response to total body iron. As demand for body iron increases there is a 
corresponding upregulation in the uptake of heme iron. For example, in iron-deficient 
individuals, absorption of heme iron can increase to 40% whereas in those who are iron-
sufficient, only 10% of heme iron may be absorbed

target="right" >Hallberg et al., 1998</a>).</span>

<p></p>
The absorption of nonheme iron, in contrast to heme iron, is modified by the ingestion of several 
dietary components when consumed in the same meal as well as the level of iron stores of the 
individual. Dietary components that inhibit nonheme iron absorption include phytate, 
polyphenols, and peptides from partially digested proteins (e.g., soybean protein). Phytic acid  
(myo-inositol hexakisphosphoric acid and its associated magnesium, calcium, or potassium salts  
collectively termed phytate, are present in high concentrations in unrefined cereals, legumes,   
and oleaginous seeds. In unrefined cereals, phytate is typically concentrated in the outer aleurone 
layer, except for maize, where it is mainly in the germ. In legumes and most oilseeds, phytate is 
uniformly distributed within the protein bodies of the endosperm or kernel

<p></p>
Phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphoric acid) is made up of an inositol ring with six 
phosphate ester groups (i.e., InsP6) and is the most abundant form of myo-inositol phosphate 
found in mature, unprocessed, plant-based foods. Phytic acid is the main inhibitor of nonheme 
iron absorption, forming insoluble complexes with iron (and other minerals) in the upper 
gastrointestinal tract which cannot be digested or absorbed by humans because of the absence of 
intestinal phytase enzymes 

<span data-tippy-content="Iqbal TH, Lewis KO, Cooper BT. Phytase activity in the 
human and rat small intestine. Gut. 1994 Sep;35(9):1233-6. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7959229/"
target="right" >Iqbal et al., 1994</a>).</span>

Several food preparation and processing methods 
such as soaking, germination, fermentation, and milling can lead to reductions in phytic acid, 
either by loss of water-soluble phytic acid, or by hydrolysis by phytase enzyme of phytic acid to 
lower myo-inositol phosphate forms that no longer inhibit nonheme iron absorption (i.e., IP2; 
IP1).The negative effect of phytate on iron absorption is dose dependent, with phytate-to-iron 
molar ratios less than at least 1:1, and preferably less  than 0.4:1 before iron absorption is 
enhanced

<p></p>
Polyphenol compounds from beverages such as tea, coffee, cocoa, and red wine, vegetables 
(spinach, aubergine), legumes (colored beans), and cereals such as red sorghum, also inhibit non-
heme iron absorption. Their inhibitory effect is dose-dependent, the strength depending on the 
structure of the phenolic compounds, with the gallate-containing tea polyphenols having the 
largest inhibitory effect

Of these, ascorbic acid is the most potent enhancer of nonheme iron absorption 
through its ability to convert ferric 
(Fe3+)  iron to ferrous (Fe2+) iron at low pH as well as its chelating properties

The enhancing effect of ascorbic acid is dose-dependent and most marked when 
consumed with meals that contain high levels of inhibitors, including phytate and polyphenols.

of which degrade ascorbic acid

The mechanism whereby muscle tissue 
enhances nonheme iron absorption is not clear. It may be linked to cysteine-containing peptides 
released during digestion, which have the potential to reduce 
ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) iron to ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>2+)
iron and chelate iron as described for ascorbic acid

Host-related factors influencing absorption and utilization of iron include the iron status of the 
individual and physiological status. For example, there is a well established  inverse relationship 
between the size of the body iron store and absorption of iron in healthy individuals so that when 
iron stores are sufficient, less iron is absorbed, as noted earlier

Ethnic differences in iron homeostasis have also been reported, with higher concentrations of iron status 
indicators (serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and hemoglobin) in East Asians than Europeans, 
African Americans, or South Asians, although the genetic determinants of these differences are 
unknown

Inflammation and obesity are also known to play an important role 
in iron bioavail&shy;ability

During inflammation and obesity, there is an increase in 
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the systemic circulation, which in turn increase hepatic 
synthesis of hepcidin levels. Elevated serum hepcidin levels reduce both intestinal absorption of 
iron as well as the release of iron from body stores

The earlier algorithms estimating iron bioavail&shy;ability were developed from results of isotopically

enhancers and inhibitors and other factors on iron absorption

Moreover, initially only the effects of the enhancers of 
nonheme iron absorption (i.e., ascorbic acid and animal flesh) were considered, with absorption 
of heme iron assumed to be 25% and to account for 40% of the iron in meat, poultry or fish

is the most detailed and considered the effects 
of all known modifiers of nonheme iron absorption, interactions, as well as adjustments for the 
iron status of the individual. High iron stores are known to increase the expression of hepcidin 
which reduces iron absorption, whereas with low iron stores hepcidin expression is reduced so 
iron absorption increases

is difficult to apply, in part because of incomplete food composition data for the 
absorption modifiers. For a detailed review of these early algorithms, see Reddy 

<span data-tippy-content="Reddy MB. Algorithms to assess non-heme

<p></p>
More recently, several algorithms have been developed to predict the bioavail&shy;ability of iron in 
whole diets because of the known exaggerated effects of the dietary modifiers on bioavail&shy;ability 
when based on single test meals 

<span data-tippy-content="Cook JD, Reddy MB. Effect of ascorbic acid intake on nonheme-iron

In some of these newer algorithms the form of the iron (i.e., heme or nonheme iron), 
the content of several known dietary enhancers and 
inhibitors in the diets, and the iron status of the individual are considered. None, however, 
attempt to estimate the simultaneous effects of enhancers and inhibitors on iron absorption.  
Some of the models only predict nonheme iron absorption so assumptions about the absorption 
of heme iron must be made; 25% is the value most frequently assumed

A further limitation is that phytate values, when included, generally 
represent the sum of all the myo-inositol phosphate forms in foods rather than only those forms 
known to inhibit nonheme iron absorption (i.e., InsP6 to IP3)

<span data-tippy-content="Tseng M, Chakraborty H, Robinson DT,

Using the values for total inositol phosphates is likely to increase the apparent negative 
impact of InsP6 in the models, thus compromising the ability of the models to accurately predict 
iron absorption. However, a new global food composition database that includes values for InsP6 
and lower myo-inositol phosphate forms (and iron, zinc, and calcium) of plant-based foods, 
together with details of the processing and analytical methods is now available, enabling users to 
select myo-inositol phosphate values based on the most appropriate processing and analytical 
method

Nevertheless, all algorithms have limitations often under-estimating bioavail&shy;ability when 
compared with measured absorption. Reports have shown a 3-fold variation in bioavail&shy;ability 
estimated by applying different algorithms

Ultimately, 
the choice of an algorithm to use depends on the population under study, and the type of dietary 
and biochemical data available. Some examples of algorithms applicable for the diets of children 
and adults are described briefly below.

<h3> 4b.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;FAO/WHO semi-quantitative model </h3>

This semi-quantitative classification was based on results from isotopically labeled iron 
absorption studies on typical single meals in Asia, India, Latin America, and Western countries. 
FAO/WHO estimated dietary iron bioavail&shy;ability for three different categories of 
diet that relate to the amount of meat and dietary iron absorption modifiers, as shown in Box 
4b.1, although they do not quantify the exact amounts. 
<p></p>

<a id="box4b.1"></a>
<div class="box">
<b>Box 4b.1: FAO/WHO  semi-quantitative model to estimate iron bioavail&shy;ability</b>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
Low-bioavail&shy;ability diet (iron absorption of about 5 percent): a simple, monotonous diet 
containing cereals, roots and/or tubers, and negligible quantities of meat, fish, or ascorbic 
acid-rich foods
<li>
Intermediate-bioavail&shy;ability diet (iron absorption of about 10 percent): a simple, 
monotonous diet containing cereals, roots, and/or tubers, and minimal quantities of food 
of animal origin and ascorbic acid, both of which promote iron bioavail&shy;ability 
<li>
High-bioavail&shy;ability diet (iron absorption of about 12 or 15 percent depending mainly 
on the meat content): a diversified diet containing generous quantities of meat, poultry, 
fish, and/or foods containing high amounts of ascorbic acid.

Note the estimates of absorption given in Box 4b.1 refer to non-anemic individuals with normal 
iron transport (i.e., with normal hemoglobin concentration) but no iron stores. When individuals 
have iron deficiency anemia (i.e., low hemoglobin and no iron stores), absorption may be 
increased by 50 percent (i.e., increasing to percentages of 7.5, 15, and 22.5, respectively, in 
absorption for the low, intermediate, and high-bioavail&shy;ability diets)

Note that for Western-type diets, FAO and WHO now propose two 
categories of bioavail&shy;ability &mdash; 12% 
and 15% &mdash; depending on the meat content of the diet. 
There are no data available validating the 
results of this model in relation to the iron status of populations

This model was adapted from the algorithm of Monsen & Balintfy

<span data-tippy-content="Monsen ER, Balintfy JL. Calculating dietary iron 
bioavail&shy;ability: refinement and computerization. J Am Diet Assoc. 1982 Apr;80(4):307-11. ">

to estimate iron 
bioavail&shy;ability in diets of children in low-income countries. In this algorithm, heme iron 
absorption is assumed to be 25%, and to account for 40% of the iron in meat, poultry, 
and fish. The absorption of nonheme iron is assumed to be lower and to vary according to the 
amount of meat, poultry, and fish, ascorbic acid, and polyphenols, as well as the level of iron 
stores of the individual. The inhibitory effect of phytate on iron absorption is not considered in 
this model.
<p></p>
To use this algorithm, quantitative data on the intake of heme iron, nonheme iron, and two 
enhancers--ascorbic acid and protein from meat, poultry, and fish--are required. The cut-offs 
applied for these two enhancers are those derived from Monsen but are expressed per 4.18 MJ 
(1000 kcal), so that the same algorithms can be used for males and females across all age groups. 
The percentage levels for the bioavail&shy;ability of nonheme iron given for each class and shown in 
Table 4b.1 approximate those of the typical meals of the low, medium, high bioavail&shy;ability 
categories of the FAO/WHO algorithm.

For individuals with iron deficiency anemia, the estimated absorption is increased by 50%, i.e., 
to 7.5%, 15%, and 22.5% absorption for low, intermediate, and high bioavail&shy;ability diets, 
respectively

The algorithm can be corrected for the inhibitory effect of 
polyphenols from tea on nonheme iron absorption. The correction factor applied depends on the 
average number of cups of tea or coffee per day. For tea, factors range from 1 if no tea is 
consumed to 0.40 for at least 600mL because a 200 to 250mL cup of normal strength tea will 
reduce nonheme iron absorption at a meal by approximately 60 percent. Corresponding 
correction factors for coffee are in the range of 1 and 0.60. The final algorithm equals:
<p></p>

\[\small \mbox {Available iron = }\]
\[\small \mbox {heme iron &times; 0.25 &plus; (nonheme iron &times; 
	availability factor &times; tea factor )}\]
<p></p>
This model can also be used to calculate the bioavail&shy;ability of iron on a daily rather than a meal 
basis, if the data for food intake by meal are not available. Estimates of available iron derived 
from day and meal-based survey results using the same model have proved comparable. This 
model has been used to estimate available iron intakes of toddlers in rural Egypt, Kenya, and 
Mexico

and included an adjustment for the 
enhancing effects of meat, poultry, and fish and vitamin&nbsp;C on nonheme iron absorption, followed 
by a further separate adjustment for the inhibiting effects of both tea and phytate. Heme iron 
availability was assumed to be 23% in this model, lower than that assumed for Murphy’s 
model (i.e., 25%).   To use this algorithm, both the nonheme and heme iron content of each food 
consumed on each eating occasion by each individual in the study sample must be included in 
the nutrient composition database. To derive these estimates, nonheme iron is assumed to be 
60% and 100% of the total iron in meats and non-meats, and the remaining iron (if any) is 
assumed to be heme.  This algorithm has had limited use. It was used to estimate the intake of 
bioavailable iron in both rural and urban children and women in Russia

This algorithm was used to estimate iron absorption from the US whole-day diet and considered 
the mean intake of inhibitors (phytate, polyphenols, calcium)  and enhancers (ascorbic acid) and 
the proportion of heme and nonheme iron. The datasets used were from four diet studies 
designed to measure the effects of ascorbic acid, meat, tea, and calcium on nonheme iron 
absorption from 5-d complete diets of US male and female adults aged 19-38y (n=53) measured 
using an extrinsic radio labeling technique. Each participant in the studies was assessed for three 
one-week periods during which they consumed diets that were typical, high, or low in meat, tea, 
calcium, or vitamin&nbsp;C. Iron status of the adults was measured using serum ferritin. Absorption of 
heme iron was assumed to be 25% in this model. Multiple linear regression was used to quantify 
the effect of different factors on nonheme iron absorption. The investigators claim the algorithm 
can be used to predict nonheme iron absorption from the diets of different populations.
<p></p>
The final fitted regression model for nonheme iron absorption in adults is:
<p></p>

\[\small \mbox {Ln Absorption (%)=6.294 – 0.709 ln (SF) + 0.119 ln (C)}\]
\[\small \mbox {+ 0.006 ln (MFP + 0.1) &minus;0.055 ln (T + 0.1)}\]
\[\small \mbox { – 0.247 ln (P) – 0.137 ln (Ca) – 0.083 ln (NH)}\]

<p></p>
Where SF is serum ferritin (&micro;g/L); C is vitamin&nbsp;C (mg); MFP is meat, fish, poultry (g); 
T is tea (number of cups); P is phytate (mg); Ca is calcium (mg); NH is nonheme iron (mg)
<p></p>
The investigators validated this algorithm with single meal and complete diet data and reported 
the r<sup>2</sup> values as 0.57 (p&nbsp;0.001) for the single meals 
and 0.84 (p&nbsp;&lt;0001) for the complete diet 
data. When applying this algorithm, the mean daily intake of nutrients based on at least 3&nbsp;days of 
diet records should be determined and serum ferritin concentrations in each participant 
measured. 
<p></p>
Of the factors explaining differences in nonheme iron absorption, serum ferritin was the most 
important; the effect of the dietary modifiers was small.  Between-person variation explained a 
large proportion of the differences in nonheme iron absorption, possibly attributed to other 
host-related factors besides iron status, such as inflammation and obesity. Further studies are needed 
to identify other unknown non-dietary factors affecting nonheme iron absorption.

applied this algorithm to estimate both nonheme iron absorption and the total 
iron bioavail&shy;ability from the US diet using information on dietary intakes and iron biomarkers 
from the NHANES 2001-2002 survey. Iron biomarkers included serum ferritin, hemoglobin, and 
C-reactive protein. For each individual, daily intakes for total iron, vitamin&nbsp;C, meat poultry, fish, 
calcium, phytate, and polyphenols (as black tea equivalents)  were obtained.  Of the total iron 
intake, 90% was estimated as nonheme iron and 10% as heme iron, with a value of 25% for 
heme iron absorption. 
<p></p>
In this study, nonheme iron absorption was estimated at the individual level and geometric 
means estimated by age and gender, and by gender and ethnicity.  The unadjusted geometric 
mean (95% CI) of unadjusted nonheme iron absorption for all individuals was 3.7% (3.6%, 
3.8%), and higher in females that males.  Two approaches were used to estimate total iron 
absorption. In the first approach all the participants of the survey were included but the 
geometric mean of nonheme iron absorption was adjusted to 15&micro;g ferritin/L serum to correspond 
to values of individuals with no iron stores. In the second approach absorption of nonheme iron 
was estimated only for nonanemic individuals with no iron stores. Using the two approaches, 
after correcting individual nonheme iron absorption values and adding fractional absorption from 
heme iron (i.e., 25%), the calculated percentages of total dietary iron absorption for US diets 
were 15.5% and 15.1%, compared with the current estimate of 18%

<p></p>
The authors cautioned that estimating total iron absorption for all individuals without adjusting 
for serum ferritin is not advisable because the value obtained underestimates iron absorption for 
individuals with low iron stores while overestimating absorption for those with very high iron 
stores. Instead, by adjusting nonheme iron absorption to 15&micro;g ferritin/L serum as carried out in 
their first approach, absorption is only overestimated in those individuals with adequate iron 
stores.

<span data-tippy-content="Collings R, Harvey LJ, Hooper L,

These investigators conducted a systematic review and calculated nonheme iron absorption from 
pooled data on iron status (serum or plasma ferritin) and dietary modifiers based on five isotope 
studies on whole diets of 58 U.S adults > 18y. Studies that included participants with unspecified 
illness or disease were excluded except those with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. 
From the individual data, a regression equation for nonheme iron absorption was derived based 
on a simplified scoring system. The latter was used to classify diets in view of the limited effect 
of the dietary factors on nonheme iron absorption in healthy iron-replete individuals. Age and 
sex were shown to have no effect and hence were not included in the regression equation shown 
below:  
<p></p>
\[\small \mbox {Log[nonheme-iron absorption, %]}\] 
\[\small \mbox {= &minus;0.73 log[ferritin, &micro;g/L] + 0.11[modifier] + 1.82}\]
<p></p> 
Where [modifier] is 0 for standard diets, -1 for diets that include an inhibitor, 
and +1 for diets that include an enhancer.
<p></p>
Note this equation was used to predict the effect of dietary modifiers on percentage absorption of 
nonheme iron in individuals with low to high serum ferritin concentrations (6&#8209;80&micro;g/L). Within 
this range of serum ferritin concentrations (6&#8209;80&micro;g/L), predicted absorption values for nonheme 
iron ranged from 2.1 to 23.0%, depending on iron status and type of diet.  For individuals with 
low iron stores (serum ferritin 12&micro;g/L) consuming a standard diet, non-heme iron absorption 
was predicted to be 10.8%, increasing to 13.9% when a higher bioavail&shy;ability diet (low calcium, 
high vitamin&nbsp;C, high meat) was consumed, and decreasing to 8.4% in a lower bioavail&shy;ability diet 
(high calcium, low vitamin&nbsp;C, no meat). 
<p></p>
This algorithm only requires information on the iron status (serum or plasma ferritin) of the 
population coupled with assumptions about the type of whole diet based on the presence of 
enhancers and inhibitors. The authors emphasize that many of the studies included, although on 
whole diets, were of very short duration and did not reflect the diets consumed over time. Such 
short-term measurements of absorption may overestimate differences in iron bioavail&shy;ability 
between diets, as noted earlier

<span data-tippy-content="Hunt JR, Roughead ZK. Adaptation of iron absorption in men consuming 
diets with high or low iron bioavail&shy;ability. Am J Clin Nutr. 2000 Jan;71(1):94-102. ">

target="right" >Hunt & Roughead, 2000</a>).</span>

In addition, because the individual iron 
absorption data pooled to develop the regression equation was from US studies and based on 
young adults, the regression equation should not be extrapolated to predict absorption of 
nonheme iron from low-income countries or for men and women of different ages.

an estimate of the quantity of absorbed heme iron using an assumed 
absorption value must be added to the value for predicted nonheme iron absorption. In contrast, 
the probability-based approach of Dainty et al. predicts total dietary iron absorption (both heme 
and nonheme iron) at the population level and can provide estimates of total iron absorption from 
a mixed Western-style diet at any level of iron status. For this approach, measurements of serum 
ferritin, intakes of total iron (heme and nonheme iron), and factorial calculations of iron 
requirements for the population are required. However, unlike most of the earlier algorithms, no 
data on dietary iron absorption modifiers or heme iron are required. Furthermore, estimates of 
dietary iron bioavail&shy;ability can be made not just for adult individuals with low storage age 
(defined by serum ferritin of 15&micro;g/L), but for any selected mean serum ferritin level. 
Nevertheless, the method cannot be used for children, pregnant women, and individuals 
immediately after menopause because of their changing iron requirements. In addition, care must 
be taken to ensure the serum ferritin concentrations are not confounded by 
inflammation/infection or obesity by employing the BRINDA correction method

This novel approach was developed using adult data on dietary intakes from a 
mixed Western-style diet (via 7d diet diary), hematological measures (hemoglobin 
and serum ferritin) from a 
representative group of men (n=495; mean age 42.7&pm;12.1y) and pre-menopausal women (n=378; 
mean age 35.7&pm;8.2y) from the 2000&#8209;2001 adult cohort of the UK National Diet and Nutrition 
Survey (NDNS). Individuals with elevated serum ferritin concentrations due to inflammation 
(i.e., elevated &alpha;&#8209;1&#8209;antichymotrypsin) or those taking iron supplements were excluded.
<p></p>
The first step involved estimating the distribution of dietary iron requirements for the NDNS 
study sample. This was achieved by employing the factorial modeling developed by the US 
Institute of Medicine

<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine (US) Panel on Micronutrients.

that calculated the distribution of estimated iron 
requirements needed to meet body functions with a minimal iron store for several age and sex groups. 
The IOM values for pre-menopausal women (mixed population of oral contraceptive users and 
non-users) and men were used. The derived dietary iron requirements for the UK NDNS study 
sample were converted to requirements for absorbed iron for individuals with low levels of 
storage ion but were not anemic by multiplying by 0.18 (U.S. IOM values assume 18% iron 
absorption from a US mixed adult diet). In addition, a full probability approach was also applied 
to the dietary iron intake data from the UK NDNS to predict the prevalence of a dietary iron 
intake that would be sufficient to maintain iron balance for the men and women based on their 
estimated daily iron intake and a series of percentage iron absorption values from 1&#8209;40%. An 
average dietary iron absorption in the population sample was then calculated for selected serum 
ferritin concentrations by matching the observed prevalence of inadequacy (i.e., from prevalence 
of serum ferritin below the designated level) with the prevalence predicted for the range of 
absorption estimates (from 1&#8209;40%).
<p></p>
Using this approach, the mean calculated dietary iron absorption was 8% in men (50th percentile 
for serum ferritin 85&micro;g/L) and 17% in women (50th percentile for serum ferritin 38&micro;g/L). With a 
serum ferritin level of 45mg/L, the estimated absorption for iron was similar for both men (14%) 
and for women (13%)

applied this approach to predict total iron

concentrations for men and premenopausal women because this reflects iron stores of 
approximately 120mg. At this level of ferritin, the predicted iron absorption values for European

Note that because both the iron requirements and dietary iron must be in a steady state 
for at least a year when applying this approach, it is not suitable for certain groups, as noted 
earlier. Care must be taken to ensure the appropriate correction for the impact of inflammation 
on serum ferritin concentrations is performed, when necessary (see “Acute and chronic inflam-
mation” in Chapter 17, Section 17.7.1 for more details).

Subsequently, additional data from a nationally representative survey in Ireland and data 
collected in older people in the UK have been included in the model

For diets in Benin in which 29% of iron was from cereals and 
30% from animal products, predicted iron absorption was 6% at a serum ferritin value of 30&micro;g/L 
compared with 18% for the Western diet reported earlier

Moreover, iron absorption remained low until the serum ferritin fell below 25&micro;g/L. More work is 
required to adapt the existing model for adults from other low and middle-income countries in 
which intakes of iron absorption inhibitors may be higher and heme iron intakes lower than those 
in whole diets in Benin.

<h3> 4b.2  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bioavail&shy;ability of zinc</h3>

The absorption of dietary zinc, unlike iron, does not change in response to alterations in whole-
body zinc homeostasis or status. Instead, zinc absorption is influenced by current zinc intake, not 
the past or long-term zinc intakes, or status.  With increasing zinc intakes, the total amount of 
absorbed zinc over the whole day increases while the percent absorbed (i.e., fractional 
absorption) declines (Figure 4b.1). Fractional zinc absorption is determined by 
dividing the amount absorbed by the amount digested.

In addition to the amount of the dietary zinc intake, food sources of zinc may also affect zinc 
absorption. The dietary factor with the greatest effect on zinc absorption is phytic acid 
(myoinositol hexakisphosphoric acid (InsP6) and its associated magnesium, potassium, and calcium salts

that cannot be digested or absorbed by humans, as noted earlier. This inhibitory effect on zinc 
absorption follows a dose-dependent response and can be substantial. If the habitual diet is rich 
in phytate, adults cannot adapt by increasing zinc absorption

As noted earlier, InsP6 may be dephosphorylated during certain food processing, preparation,

phosphate (InsP5) significantly inhibits the bioavail&shy;ability of zinc; the lower inositol phosphates 
have no inhibitory effect

Molar ratios of phytate-to-zinc of individual foods or whole diets are often used to estimate the 
likely proportion of zinc absorbed in view of the dose-dependent inhibiting response of phytate 
on zinc absorption. Consequently, molar ratios of phytate-to-zinc of individual foods or whole 
diets are a critical component of any algorithm used to estimate zinc bioavail&shy;ability. Where 
possible, local food composition data for zinc, and the global food composition database for 
phytate should be used to calculate phytate: zinc molar ratios, as both the zinc and phytate 
content of plant-based foods can vary with both local soil conditions and food preparation and 
processing practices

Below is the equation to calculate the 
phytate:zinc molar ratio for a whole diet.

\[\small \mbox{= }\frac{\mbox{mg phytate per day / 660}}{ \mbox{mg zinc per day / 65.4}}\]
 
For example, if the phytate intake is 883 mg/d and the zinc intake is 7 mg/d, then the 
phytate:zinc molar ratio is 12.4.

to estimate the bioavail&shy;ability of zinc,  
the protein from meat, fish or poultry  was considered an enhancer of zinc absorption, while both 
high levels  of calcium, particularly calcium salts, and the proportion of phytate to zinc in the 
whole diet were considered inhibitors of zinc absorption. This led to the use of millimolar ratios 
of phytate &times; calcium : zinc to predict zinc absorption

<h3> 4b.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;WHO semi-quantitative classification for bioavailable zinc </h3>

This was developed in 1996 by WHO and adopted by FAO and WHO in 2002 and in 2004. 
WHO applied zinc absorption data from published isotope studies on adults that focused mainly 
on single meals, individual foods, and some whole-day diets. To determine the proportion of 
dietary zinc that was absorbed by the intestine (i.e., fractional zinc absorption), the mean amount 
of absorbed zinc was regressed against total zinc intakes from diet types that differed in their 
composition. 
<p></p>
The WHO system takes into account three dietary variables, considered important predictors of 
the bioavail&shy;ability of zinc at that time. These include the amount and source of dietary protein, 
the proportion of phytic acid to zinc in the whole diet, and high levels of calcium, particularly 
calcium salts, as noted earlier.  In general, however, the calcium content of most plant-based 
diets is probably too low to have any detrimental effect. No allowance for an adaptive response 
to meet the additional physiological demands for zinc during pregnancy or lactation was 
considered by WHO in view of the paucity of data at that time.
<p></p>
The FAO/WHO 

<span data-tippy-content="WHO/FAO (World Health organization/Food 
and Agriculture Organization), 2004. Vitamin&nbsp;and

(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241546123"
target="right" >2004</a>)</span> system of classifying diets into three broad categories of 
low, moderate, and high zinc bioavail&shy;ability is described in Box 4b.2. 
 

<a id="box4b.2"></a>
<div class="box">
<b>Box 4b.2: FAO/WHO  semi-quantitative model for estimating the bioavail&shy;ability of zinc </b>
<p></p>

<b>Low-bioavail&shy;ability diets:</b> zinc absorption of about 15%. Such diets are characterized by: 
<ul>
<li> diets high in unrefined, unfermented and ungerminated cereal grains (e.g., flat breads 
or sorghum), especially when fortified with inorganic calcium salts and when intake 
of animal protein is negligible;
<li> diets in which the phytate : zinc molar ratio typically exceeds 15 or 18;
<li> diets in which high-phytate soy-protein products constitute the primary protein source; 
<li> diets in which approximately 50% of the energy intake is accounted for either by one 
or a combination of the following high-phytate foods: high-extraction-rate (>90%)
wheat, rice, maize grains and flours, oatmeal and millet (chapatti flours and tanok), 
sorghum, pigeon peas, grams, blackeye beans, kidney beans, groundnut flours; and 
<li> diets that have high intakes of inorganic calcium salts (more than 1g Ca<sup>++</sup>/d) either as 
supplements or as adventitious contaminants (e.g., from calcareous geophagia) which 
potentiate the inhibitory effects of low-availability diets; low intakes of animal 
protein exacerbate these effects. 
</li></ul>
<b>Moderate bioavail&shy;ability diets</b> are mostly mixed diets with a zinc bioavail&shy;ability of about 30%. 
They include: 
<ul>
<li> mixed diets containing animal or fish protein;
<li> lacto-ovo, ovo-vegetarian, or vegan diets not based primarily on unrefined cereal grains 
or high-extraction-rate flours; 
<li> diets in which a phytate : zinc molar ratio of the total diet is within the range of 5 to 15 
or not exceeding 10 if more than 50% of the energy intake is accounted for by 
unfermented, unrefined cereal grains and flours while the diet is fortified with inorganic 
calcium salts (more than 1g Ca<sup>++</sup>/day); 
<li> modern diets in which the bioavail&shy;ability of zinc improves when the diet includes 
animal protein or other protein sources or milks;
</li></ul>

<b>High bioavail&shy;ability diets</b> are mostly diets with an adequate protein content mainly from non-
vegetable sources. They have a zinc bioavail&shy;ability of about 50%, and include: 
<ul>
<li> refined diets low in cereal fiber, with a low phytic acid content and with a phytate : zinc 
molar ratio less than 5; and adequate protein content, mainly from non-vegetable sources such as meat and fish, and 
including semisynthetic formula diets based on animal protein. 
</li></ul>
</div>

As noted earlier, because of the conflicting effects of calcium and the limited effect of dietary 
protein on zinc absorption, neither calcium or protein are included in more recent zinc 
bioavail&shy;ability algorithms.

qualitative estimate for the intake of total absorbable zinc </h3>

Since 1996, new research has led to the development of revised qualitative and quantitative 
models for estimating zinc absorption. IZiNCG

<span data-tippy-content="IZiNCG (2019) Determining the risk if zinc deficiency:

has provided a qualitative estimate for the 
intake of total absorbable zinc which is presented in a technical brief entitled: Determining the 
risk of zinc deficiency. To determine 
this qualitative estimate, the first step is to calculate the total intake of zinc and phytate from the 
dietary intake data, based preferable on three non-consecutive days. Local food composition data 
for zinc should be used, as these can vary with local soil conditions

<span data-tippy-content="Alloway BJ. Zinc in soils and crop nutrition.

target="right" >Alloway, 2004</a>).</span>  

Data on the zinc content of local foods can be obtained from regional and national centers of the FAO 
Network of Food Data Systems (INFOODs). These food composition tables can be downloaded 
free of charge from the

<span data-tippy-content="FAO/INFOODS website">
	(<a href="https://www.fao.org/infoods/infoods/tables-and-databases/faoinfoods-databases/en/"
	target="right" >FAO/INFOODS website</a>).</span>
	
<p></p>
The values for the phytate content of raw and processed plant-based staples are available in the 
FAO/INFOODS/IZiNCG Global Food Composition Database for phytate.  Care must also be 
taken to ensure the myo-inositol phosphate values selected consider both the most appropriate 
food processing and analytical method.
<p></p>
Next, the phytate : zinc molar ratios of the whole diets must be calculated, as shown in Box 4b.2  
to provide an estimate of likely zinc absorption. Diets with phytate : zinc molar ratios greater 
than 18 are considered unrefined cereal-based diets and 
classified as having low zinc bioavail&shy;ability (i.e., 18% absorption for males and 25% absorption 
for females), whereas diets with ratios 4-18 are considered mixed or refined vegetarian diets and 
classified as having average zinc bioavail&shy;ability (i.e., 26% absorption for males and 34% 
absorption for females). Note that if information on the phytate content of the diets cannot be 
calculated, then the zinc bioavail&shy;ability of the diets should be categorized based on whether they 
are based on unrefined cereals and/or legumes (i.e., low bioavail&shy;ability) or mixed or refined 
vegetarian diets (i.e., average zinc bioavail&shy;ability)

<h3> 4b.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)

This model provides estimates for adults of total absorbed zinc from Western diets. It is based on 
a refinement of the trivariate saturation response model of total absorbed zinc developed initially 
by Miller et al.

For their refined model EFSA extracted individual values for true zinc absorption from 10 
whole-day isotope studies in healthy adults based on representative Western diets. For each 
study, intakes of total dietary zinc (TDZ) and total dietary phytate were reported.  A total of 72 
data points, reflecting 650 individual measurements, were used to generate predictions of total 
absorbed zinc as a function of total dietary zinc at 6 different levels of dietary phytate, ranging 
from 0 to 3000mg/d as shown in Figure&nbsp;4b.3. The modifying effects of calcium, protein, and 
iron were found to be insignificant and hence were discounted in the final model, which was said 
to account for more than 80% of the variance in total absorbed zinc.

data from infants and children with a mean age of 24months, no significant inhibitory effect of 
phytate was reported. The only significant predictor of zinc absorption in their model apart from 
the dietary zinc content, was child age. It is possible, however, that the lack of a significant effect 
of phytate was due in part to insufficient statistical power as few studies included data on phytate 
intakes, as noted earlier.   More recent zinc tracer studies have reported marked increases in zinc absorption

<h3> 4b.3  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bioavail&shy;ability of other nutrients </h3>

Research on factors affecting the bioavail&shy;ability of other nutrients in contemporary 
diets is urgently required. For several nutrients, the amount available for absorption 
can be only estimated. Such estimates are generally made by the expert committees 
formulating the nutrient recommendations, and they vary primarily according to 
the characteristics of the habitual diet of a country. More work is required to 
develop algorithms for predicting the bioavail&shy;ability of these micronutrients in 
diets of differing compositions. So far, steps have been taken to develop algorithms 
to quantify the bioavail&shy;ability of protein, 
folate, vitamin&nbsp;A, vitamin&nbsp;E, and vitamin&nbsp;D
in human diets; these are considered below. Niacin is discussed in Section 4a.2.4.

<h3> 4b.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;Protein-digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS). </h3>

This score considers the content of amino acids and the digestibility of the ingested 
protein, attributes of protein quality which have frequently been neglected in many 
studies investigating the adequacy of dietary protein

Initially, the amino acid requirements of preschool-age children (i.e., 1-2y) was 
used as this was considered the most demanding in terms of protein quality of 
indispensable amino acids). However, with the recognition that requirements for 
the indispensable amino acids differ among age groups, age-specific amino acid 
scoring patterns (mg/g protein) for calculating protein quality were recommended 
by FAO in

This comparison generates a limiting amino acid score for the test protein which is 
then multiplied by digestibility. For the PDCAAS method, nitrogen fecal 
digestibility (i.e., digestibility over the whole intestine) is applied. The calculation 
is shown below:

\[\small \mbox  {PDCAAS =} \frac{\mbox {mg of limiting amino acid in 1g test protein}}
{\mbox {mg of the same amino acid in 1g of the reference protein}}\]
\[\small \mbox  { &times; true fecal digestibility}\]

<p></p>
Note initially the highest PDCAAS score any protein could achieve was 1.0. This 
indicated that the protein provided all the indispensable amino acids in the amounts 
required by the body. Any scores exceeding 1.00 were truncated to a maximum of 
1.0, reflecting the view that amino acids supplied above the requirements do not 
have additional physiological value and will be catabolized. Truncation was also 
said to simplify the comparison of protein quality among different foods.

WHO/FAO/UNU questioned the practice of PDCAAS truncation, as well 
as which value to truncate (i.e., the PDCAAS or the amino acid score) prior to 
multiplying by the digestibility factor. The decision reached was to calculate 
PDCAAS values from a truncated amino acid score value on the basis that 
digestibility is first limiting. Examples of how to calculate the PDCAAS for both 
single foods and a mixture of foods are shown in Tables 4b.4 and 4b.5, 
respectively. Table 4b.4 is modified from Arsenault & Brown

Note when calculating PDCAAS values it is usually 
only necessary to use a pattern based on the four indispensable amino acids likely 
to be limiting in dietary protein. These are lysine (mostly cereal proteins), the 
sulfur amino acids (legume proteins), tryptophan (some cereals such as maize), or 
threonine (some cereals). Hence, only these four amino acids have been adjusted 
for digestibility in the examples given in Tables 4b.4 and 4b.5. Further, note the 
amino acid score for the food mixture in Table 4b.5 is calculated from the 
weighted average <i>digestible</i> amino acid content. In both examples, fecal 
digestibility factors are applied.  For more details of the calculation of PDCAAS 
scores, see Marinangeli & House

<h3> 4b.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS)</h3>

There is increasing recognition that the PDCAAS has several limitations. They 
include: true fecal nitrogen digestibility does not consider the loss from the colon 
of indispensable amino acids that were not absorbed in the ileum; failure to credit 
additional nutritional value to high biological value proteins; overestimation of 
protein foods that contain antinutritional factors; and overestimation of protein 
foods of lower digestibility when supplemented with limiting amino acids 

<span data-tippy-content="Boye J, Wijesinha-Bettoni R, Burlingame B. Protein 
quality evaluation twenty years after the introduction 
of the protein digestibility corrected 
amino acid score method. Br J Nutr. 2012 Aug;108 Suppl 2:S183-211.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23107529/"
target="right" >Boye et al., 2012</a>). </span>  

As a result, a newer method, the Digestible Indispensable 
Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) has been proposed. DIAAS relies on measures of true 
ileal digestibility of individual amino acids and lysine bioavail&shy;ability because they 
better reflect the true quantity of amino acids digested and absorbed. It also avoids 
truncation of the score obtained. The most limiting digestible indispensable amino 
acid content (DIAA) defines the DIAAS value of a protein. For DIAAS, the three 
age-related amino acid reference scoring patterns shown in Table 4b.3 are used. 
<p></p>
To calculate DIAAS of single protein source, data on the complete indispensable 
amino acid (IAA) composition of the protein, the crude protein content (CP), and 
the IAA standardized ileal digestibility (SID) are required. For a given IAAy, 
DIAAy ratio is calculated as follows:

\[\small \mbox  {DIAAS = 100 x lowest DIAAy ratio among IAAs}\]

where IAAy is expressed as mg/g CP. The lowest DIAA ratio leads to the DIAAS 
value of the protein. 
<p></p>

Values for DIAAS can also be calculated for protein mixtures. To accomplish this, 
average values of each single protein for IAAy and SIDy in the mixture must be 
obtained. See Herreman et al. 

<span data-tippy-content="Herreman L, Nommensen P, Pennings B, Laus MC.

proteins based on the digestible indispensable

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33133540/"
	target="right" >2020</a>) </span> 
	
for details of the calculation. The 
maximum DIAAS calculated among all possible ratios represents the optimal 
protein mixture. Care must be taken to ensure, where possible, that the values for 
IAAy and SIDy selected consider any processing and cooking conditions. A 
protein source or protein mixture with a DIAAS of 100 or above indicates that 
none of its indispensable amino acids is limiting and this source of protein has the 
potential to meet physiological requirements. 
<p></p>
This method was first introduced by FAO

but at that time there was a 
lack of human digestibility data available that utilized DIAAS. However, in a later 
joint FAO-IAEA meeting in 2022, valid in vitro models of ileal amino acid 
digestibility were presented and a database of ileal digestibility of proteins and 
individual amino acids in foods created

<h3> 4b.3.3  &nbsp;&nbsp;Bioavail&shy;ability of the polyglutamate and monoglutamate forms of folate </h3>

The polyglutamate form of folate occurs naturally in foods, whereas the 
monoglutamate form comprises synthetic folic acid commonly used for fortifying 
foods and dietary supplements. The polyglutamate form has a lower bioavail&shy;ability 
than synthetic folic acid. As a result, the IOM

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23193625/"
target="right" >1998</a>)</span>

introduced a new term &mdash; dietary folate equivalents (DFE) &mdash;
to consider the differences in the bioavail&shy;ability 
of all sources of ingested folate. 

<p></p>
Total dietary folate equivalent (DFE) is defined as the quantity of natural food 
folate plus 1.7 times the quantity of folic acid in the diet.

\[\small \mbox  {&micro;g DFE = &micro;g natural food folate + 
	(1.7 &times; &micro;g synthetic folic acid)}\]
 
This equation assumes that the bioavail&shy;ability of food folate is about 50%, whereas 
that of synthetic folic acid taken with food is 85% (either as a food fortificant or as 
a supplement) or 100% when a supplement is taken on an empty stomach with 
water. Hence, folic acid taken with food is 85/50 = 1.7 times more available than 
folate naturally occurring in food

Many countries are now fortifying foods such as breads and grains with the 
synthetic monoglutamate form of folate (i.e., folic acid). In the USA, Canada, Australia, 
Chile and more recently New Zealand, fortification on a mandatory (population 
wide) basis has been introduced, and has proved to be highly effective, not only in 
increasing folate status and reducing folate deficiency

Some food composition tables fail to distinguish between folate found naturally in 
foods and any synthetic folic acid added to foods as a fortificant. Work is 
underway to provide values for the total dietary folate equivalent (DFE) content of 
foods in food composition tables. Examples providing total dietary folate 
equivalents include the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference and the 
New Zealand FOODfiles

Caution must be used when borrowing dietary 
folate values from other food composition tables as they are not universally 
applicable and depend on the fortification regulations of the country. The 
following examples in Box 4b.4 provide guidance on how to convert folate values 
in a food composition database to &micro;g DFE:

calculated folate intakes, expressed as DFEs, for the U.S 
population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006. 
In contrast to earlier U.S surveys, this was the first study to include estimates 
of folic acid from dietary supplements as well as dietary folate intakes.  Hence, the 
data generated reflect intakes that account for differences in the bioavail&shy;ability of 
all sources of folate, as noted above. In this survey, 34.5% of the US population 
used dietary supplements that contained folic acid. These data emphasize that in a 
population such as the U.S where more than one-half of the population report the 
use of dietary supplements, monitoring folate status without the inclusion of such 
an important contributor of folic acid will yield inaccurate data.
<p></p>
Recently, rhe use of a single bioavail&shy;ability value to accurately reflect food folate, 
especially when used in whole diets, has been questioned. Recent research has 
highlighted the influence of many post-absorptive factors shown to modify the 
bioavail&shy;ability of folate, both naturally occurring and as folic acid. Examples of 
such factors include genetics, ethnicity-race, and sex. Clearly, in the current era of 
fortification and dietary supplement use, more large-scale studies are needed to 
refine folate bioequivalency values for use in whole diets. 

<h3> 4b.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;Bioavail&shy;ability of preformed vitamin&nbsp;A and pro-vitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids. </h3>

In the diets of most developed countries, vitamin&nbsp;A occurs mainly as preformed 
vitamin&nbsp;A derived only from animal products: fish-liver oils, liver, butterfat, and 
egg yolk are the major dietary sources. Muscle meats are poor sources of 
preformed vitamin&nbsp;A.  In contrast, in most low-income countries the main food 
sources are the provitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids from yellow and orange fruits

Provitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids include 
&beta;-carotene, &beta;-cryptoxanthin, &alpha;-carotene, lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin, of which 
&beta;-carotene and &beta;-cryptoxanthin are the most important in the diet.
<p></p>
There is a lack of consensus about the bioavail&shy;ability of ingested provitamin&nbsp;A 
carotenoids from food and the efficiency with which these absorbed carotenoids 
are subsequently converted to retinol (i.e., their bioconversion). Currently two 
conversion factors are used for calculating the amount of vitamin&nbsp;A activity in 
foods from provitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids, and the values applied differ across 
agencies. FAO/WHO

<span data-tippy-content="FAO/WHO Human vitamin&nbsp;and mineral requirements. 2002 ">

still maintain the use of 1µg retinol equals 6&micro;g of 
&beta;-carotene and 12&micro;g of other provitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids (mainly &alpha;-carotene and 
&beta;-cryptoxanthin). These same carotenoid / equivalency ratios have also been 
adopted by the European Food Safety Authority 

<span data-tippy-content="European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 2017,

(<a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/e15121"

<span data-tippy-content="New Zealand FOODfiles (2021)">
(<a href="https://www.foodcomposition.co.nz/foodfiles/"
target="right" >2021</a>).</span>

Furthermore, these agencies express the substances with vitamin&nbsp;A activity as 
retinol equivalents (RE), whether they are preformed vitamin&nbsp;A (mainly retinol and 
retinyl esters) in foods of animal origin or provitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids.
<p></p>
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board, however, concluded that the bioavail&shy;ability of 
provitamin&nbsp;A &beta;&#8209;carotene from plant sources is 12&micro;g to 1&micro;g 
retinol and 24&micro;g to 1&micro;g 
for other provitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids for healthy individuals. For a detailed 
justification of these conversion factors, see IOM 

<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine (U.S.) Panel on Micro&shy;nutrients. (2001).

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25057538/"

The U.S has also 
adopted the term retinol activity equivalents (RA) for use when calculating the 
total amount of vitamin&nbsp;A in mixed dishes or diets. 

<p></p>
Such inconsistencies in the specific carotenoids/retinol equivalency ratios applied 
exacerbate problems when comparing vitamin&nbsp;A values among food composition 
databases and, in turn, vitamin&nbsp;A intakes across countries. For example, vitamin&nbsp;A 
intakes calculated from some food composition data may be higher if the lower 
bioconversion factors for provitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids recommended by FAO/WHO 
and EFSA were used, rather than the higher bioconversion factors adopted by the 
United States. Some older food composition tables continue to express vitamin&nbsp;A 
in terms of international units (IU). Use of these older units is no longer 
appropriate for assessing dietary adequacy of vitamin&nbsp;A and should be 
discontinued

<p></p>
Increasingly, synthetic sources of retinol and 
provitamin&nbsp;A compounds (mainly &beta;&#8209;carotene) are being added to foods or used as dietary supplements worldwide. In 
developed countries, foods fortified with preformed vitamin&nbsp;A may include 
ready-to-eat cereals, snack foods, beverages, margarine, and processed dairy products, 
whereas in low&#8209; and middle-income countries sugar, cereal flours, edible oils, margarine, and 
noodles are sometimes fortified with preformed vitamin&nbsp;A. Commercial dietary 
supplements may contain both preformed vitamin&nbsp;A and provitamin&nbsp;A 
(predominately as &beta;&#8209;carotene)

As a result, when

<h3>4b.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;Bioavail&shy;ability of &alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol</h3>

Vitamin&nbsp;E, a fat-soluble vitamin, is present in the diet as eight naturally 
occurring vitamin&nbsp;E analogues: four toco&shy;pherols (&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, and &delta;) and four 
tocotrienols that have varying levels of biological activity. Major food 
sources of natural vitamin&nbsp;E are vegetable seed oils (wheat germ, sunflower, 
corn, soyabean, safflower, palm), and olive oil. Synthetic forms of &alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol 
are called <i>all&#8209;racemic</i>&#8209;&alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol
and are widely used as antioxidants, dietary

(i.e., <i>all&#8209;racemic</i>) as the only biologically active forms of vitamin&nbsp;E. 
The other naturally occurring forms of vitamin&nbsp;E in food (&beta;&#8209;, &gamma;&#8209;, and 
&delta;&#8209;toco&shy;pherols and the tocotrienols), although absorbed, do not appear 
to be converted to &alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol by humans, and are poorly recognized by 
the &alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol transfer protein (&alpha;&#8209;TTP)  in the liver. 
Hence the &beta;&#8209;, &gamma;&#8209;, and

However, WHO/FAO chose not to set any requirements for vitamin&nbsp;E due 
to the lack of information on the role of vitamin&nbsp;E in biological 
processes other than its involvement in antioxidant function at that time. 
<p></p>
In food composition tables and databases in the past, 
the vitamin&nbsp;E content of foods has been expressed as &alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol 
equivalents (&alpha;&#8209;TEs). Factors have been used to convert the toco&shy;pherols 
and tocotrienols in food to &alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol  equivalents (&alpha;&#8209;TEs). For 
example, &alpha;&#8209;TEs are defined by WHO/FAO

<p></p>
Today, in some food composition tables or databases (e.g., recent releases 
from USDA, Finland and Sweden), the vitamin&nbsp;E content of foods is 
expressed only by their &alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol content (mg/100g)

The content of other chemical forms of toco&shy;pherol naturally occurring 
but with less biological activity are ignored. Hence, the vitamin&nbsp;E 
content of foods when expressed as their &alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol content (mg/100g)

In part, this has arisen because the 2:1 biopotency ratio shown above 
was based on bioavail&shy;ability data and not on the measurement of a clinical 
endpoint. More research is urgently required that compares the relevant dose

For a usual mixed diet, 75% was considered the average 
absorption for &alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol by EFSA (2015). Absorption of &alpha;&#8209;toco&shy;pherol 
increases in the presence of dietary fat, so that in conditions associated 
with malabsorption of fat, intestinal absorption of vitamin&nbsp;E is impaired.

vitamins and carotenoids, might also influence the absorption of vitamin&nbsp;E, 
although existing evidence is limited

<h3> 4b.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;Bioavail&shy;ability of vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) and vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> 
(ergocalciferol)</h3>

Vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) is the main dietary source of vitamin&nbsp;D and is derived 
from foods of animal origin, especially fatty fish and fish liver oils, with small 
amounts in beef liver, dairy products and egg yolk. Some UV-exposed mushrooms 
provide vitamin&nbsp;D2 (ergocalciferol). Diets can also contain 25-hydroxyvitamin&nbsp;D 
(25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>), the metabolite produced in the liver, and trace amounts of dihydroxy 
cholcalciferol (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. Vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> can also be synthesized by irradiation of 
7&#8209;dehydrocholesterol in the skin by ultraviolet&nbsp;B (UVB) light.
<p></p>  
The bioavail&shy;ability of vitamin&nbsp;D in food varies widely, with reports ranging from 
55% to 99% (mean 78%) in healthy persons

vitamin&nbsp;D: a systematic review. Nutr Rev. 2018 Jan 1;76(1):60-76.">

Research on factors affecting the bioavail&shy;ability of vitamin&nbsp;D is limited. In relation to diet-
related factors, the food matrix appears to have no effect on vitamin&nbsp;D 
bioavail&shy;ability, although whether the supplement matrix also has no effect is less clear. 
Bioavail&shy;ability is improved when vitamin&nbsp;D is given with fat-containing food, as 
expected, although unaffected by the amount of fat ingested

<span data-tippy-content="Borel P, Caillaud D, Cano NJ. Vitamin&nbsp;D bioavail&shy;ability: 
state of the art. Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 2015;55(9):1193-205. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24915331/"
target="right" >Borel et al., 2015</a>).</span>

<p></p>
The effect of several host-related factors on vitamin&nbsp;D bioavail&shy;ability has also been 
investigated. Of these, neither ageing nor obesity modify vitamin&nbsp;D bioavail&shy;ability, 
whereas in several diseases associated with fat malabsorption vitamin&nbsp;D absorption 
is impaired. More data are required to establish whether genetic factors, or the 
vitamin&nbsp;D status of the host, affect vitamin&nbsp;D bioavail&shy;ability. 
<p></p>
Studies consistently report the bioavail&shy;ability 
of 25&#8209;hydroxyvitamin&nbsp;D (25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>) 
to be higher (i.e., about three times) than that for vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> (ergocalciferol) 
or vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> 
(cholecalciferol). Uncertainty exists on whether there are differences in the 
bioavail&shy;ability of vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> (ergocalciferol) and vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol). 
Both forms appear to exhibit identical responses in the body and hence are 
considered bioequivalent

so are expressed in &micro;g regardless of whether 
they are from  conventional foods, fortified foods, or supplements.  For details on 
the mechanism of vitamin&nbsp;D absorption, see Borel et al.

<p></p>
Both vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> (ergocalciferol) and vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) may be present 
in fortified foods and dietary supplements. In developed countries, some foods are 
fortified, generally with a dry stabilized form of vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> which contains an 
antioxidant. Examples of foods fortified with vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> include cow’s milk, dried 
milk powder, evaporated milk, cereals, bread, and margarine

Consequently, care must be taken to use country-specific food composition 
databases for values on the vitamin&nbsp;D content of these food items.
