Principles of Nutritional<br>Assessment: Phos&shy;phorus
</h1>
<p> 3rd Edition,  May, 2024 </p>

<div class="abstract">
<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

The essential nutrient phos&shy;phorus
(in nature occurring as phos&shy;phate) is
ubiquitous in all the foods we eat, the human
body and, in effect, all living organisms.
phos&shy;phate is critical to structural and
biochemical functions needed to secure
energy, reproduce and grow.  Most of the
body's phos&shy;phate is contained within bones,
teeth, membranes and intracellular spaces;
however, it is the 1% present in the
extracellular space, serum that is clinically
measured to inform about physiologic and
nutritional phos&shy;phate status.
<p></p>
Serum phos&shy;phate in healthy individuals usually
reflects phos&shy;phate balance that is main&shy;tained
within a narrow range by hormonal control of
renal reabsorption and excretion, and
intes&shy;tinal absorption when dietary phos&shy;phate
intakes are low or excessive.  Regu&shy;lation of
serum phos&shy;phate involves the inter&shy;play of
four organs (kidneys, intestine, bone and
parathyroid glands), phos&shy;phate in these organs, and the
actions of three endo&shy;crine hormones
(para&shy;thyroid hormone, calcitriol (the active
form of vita&shy;min&nbsp;D), and bone-secreted
fibro&shy;blast growth factor&#8209;23 (FGF&#8209;23), all of which
influence the activity of the phos&shy;phate
trans&shy;porters to increase or decrease
absorption, reabsor&shy;ption or excretion of
phos&shy;phate.
<p></p>
Hyperphos&shy;phatemia (i.e., serum
phos&shy;phate &gt;&nbsp;1.45mmol/L) is often related to
excess dietary phos&shy;phate intake by the
consumption of phos&shy;phate additive-rich
processed foods, or the typical Western diets
when kidney function is impaired.  Higher
serum phos&shy;phate has been associated with
disruption of endo&shy;crine pathways that may
link high phos&shy;phate intake with pathology
associated with chronic disease risk,
including cardio&shy;vascular disease.  In
contrast, hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia (i.e., serum
phosphate  &lt;&nbsp;0.87mmol/L) is
rarely related to dietary deficiency of
phos&shy;phate except in cases of severe
malnutrition, and more likely due to inborn
errors of metabolism or tumor production of
excess FGF&#8209;23 that causes renal phos&shy;phate
wasting and bone disease (rickets and osteo&shy;malacia).

Phos&shy;phorus is the 11<sup>th</sup> most abundant
element yet phos&shy;phorus is not present in
nature as elemental phos&shy;phorus, instead occurring
mainly bound to oxygen as phos&shy;phate

Deposits of phos&shy;phate-rich rock in the earth's
crust slowly release phos&shy;phate which builds
up in soils over time, entering the
food chain via soil microbes, and then crops, livestock, and other components
of the human food supply.  However, deposits of rocks rich in phos&shy;phate
are limited across the globe. When mined, these phos&shy;phate
deposits are largely used
as fertilizers for crop growth

Phos&shy;phorus is often the key growth-limiting
factor for all living things. As an
essential nutrient, phos&shy;phorus functions in critical pathways and cellular
components in all life forms on earth, ranging from subcellular viruses to
complex plants and animals, all dependent on phos&shy;phate for energy, growth,
reproduction, structure, and homeo&shy;stasis facilitated through signal
transduction. Phos&shy;phates participate in all biological processes providing
energy stored in phos&shy;phodiester bonds of
ATP (the phos&shy;phodiester backbone of
RNA and DNA). Other functional roles include the structural integrity of cell
membranes as phos&shy;pholipids, regulation of acid
base balance, mineral&shy;ization of
teeth and bones, lipid transport in blood, and   signalling pathways essential
to main&shy;taining phos&shy;phate homeo&shy;stasis.
As phos&shy;phate has such a critical role in
so many biological processes, phos&shy;phate homeo&shy;stasis
must be tightly regulated.
In conditions when sources of phos&shy;phate are
deficient, growth or reproduction
is limited, whereas with excess, toxicity may  occur, which in humans may
manifest as disease

an ionic anion, an inorganic salt, and as an organic compound, using phytate as
the example. Inorganic or mineral phos&shy;phate largely comprises the different
salts of ortho&shy;phos&shy;phate that occur in
greater abundance than pyrophos&shy;phate.
Within the pH range of the human body,
the two main forms of ortho&shy;phos&shy;phates
are H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-1</sup> and HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>.
The organic form of phos&shy;phate occur when bound to a
carbon atom of protein, lipids, nucleic acids, and other organic compounds,
usually through phos&shy;phate ester
linkages. The total body phos&shy;phate content in
an adult human is about 900g of
elemental phos&shy;phorus, existing mainly in the
skeleton and teeth, with less amounts in soft tissues.
<p></p>
The phos&shy;phate in bone and teeth is
present as calcium phos&shy;phate hydroxy&shy;apatite
(Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>).
Less than 1% of phos&shy;phorus occurs in the
extra&shy;cellular space. Intra&shy;cellular
phos&shy;phate consists largely of organic
molecules such as creatine phos&shy;phate, ATP,
nucleic acids, phos&shy;pholipids and
phos&shy;pho&shy;proteins in concen&shy;trations of phos&shy;phate of
about 1mmol/L.
<p></p>
When assayed in biological fluids and tissues, only inorganic phosphate is
measured. Prior to analysis, the analytical samples other than serum must be
ashed to remove the organic material, after which the residue is dissolved in
dilute acid in preparation for analysis by AOAC, AAS or ICP-MS, which report
total phosphorus as elemental P. In food composition databases and tables, the
values are expressed as mg elemental P per serving or per 100g food item.
<p></p>
Clinically, the terms phos&shy;phate
and phos&shy;phorus are used interchangeably.
However, because elemental phos&shy;phorus does not occur in the human body,
phos&shy;phorus is usually measured
as&nbsp;mg phos&shy;phate and can be converted to molar P
concent&shy;ration by dividing the measured weight
in&nbsp;mg by the atomic weight of P (31).

<h3 id="23b.3">23b.3 Interpretive criterion: serum phos&shy;phate</h3>

Serum phos&shy;phate is the most frequently
used bio&shy;marker of phos&shy;phorus status in a
clinical setting, and is usually measured in the fasting state. However, the
measure&shy;ment of a single fasting
serum  phos&shy;phate concen&shy;tration represents only
a small portion of the total
body phos&shy;phate, and hence does not always reflect
the body  phos&shy;phate stores. Measure&shy;ment
of serum or plasma phos&shy;phate
concen&shy;tration requires the use of anti&shy;coagulants
such as heparin which do not
interfere with the color reaction described for
the AOAC spectro&shy;photo&shy;metric
method described in 23b.2. Hemolyzed samples are not
suitable for phos&shy;phate
measure&shy;ment as erythro&shy;cyte phos&shy;phate confounds
the measure&shy;ment and hemo&shy;globin
contributes color inter&shy;ference.
Serum phos&shy;phate concen&shy;trations can also
be affected tempor&shy;arily by acute shifts
of phos&shy;phate between
intra&shy;cellular and extra&shy;cellular compart&shy;ments without
affecting total body content

Serum phos&shy;phate concen&shy;trations are main&shy;tained
within a narrow range (see
Section 23b.5 for details of the
hormonal regulation of serum phos&shy;phate).
In adults, total serum inorganic phos&shy;phate ranges
between 0.87-1.45mmol/L
<a href="#table23b.1">(Table&nbsp;23b.1):</a>
56% is
ionized, 20% bound to protein and 24% bound to other cations. However, there
is a signif&shy;icant amount of organic phos&shy;phate in
serum (7.5&#8209;8.0mg/dL or 2.4&#8209;2.6mmol/L) which is not
included in the analytical method used by clinical
laboratories. When serum phos&shy;phate concen&shy;trations
fall below the normal range,
a condition called hypo&shy;phos&shy;phat&shy;emia occurs,
whereas for concen&shy;trations above
the normal range, hyper&shy;phos&shy;phat&shy;emia develops;
serious clinical con&shy;sequences can
arise from both conditions.
<p></p>
Several factors affect serum  phos&shy;phate concen&shy;trations.
Diurnal variation in
serum phos&shy;phate occurs with concen&shy;trations
lowest at 9AM and highest at 7PM.
There is also a seasonal variation, whereby levels are
higher during the summer
than during the winter; this may arise
because phos&shy;phorus absorption is
stimulated by the greater synthesis of vitamin&#8209;D
with higher summer sunlight
exposure. Serum phos&shy;phate is also
higher in women than in men (by about 0.31mg/dL,
0.1mmol/L), and higher in children (i.e., normal range 1.45&#8209;1.78mmol/L)
than adults (i.e., normal range 0.87&#8209;1.45mmol/L); see Table 23b.1.
<p></p>
Normal serum phos&shy;phate values for
children and adults are shown in Table 23b.1.
Hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia is usually
defined as serum phos&shy;phate &lt;&nbsp;0.87mmol/L and
hyperphos&shy;phatemia as a
serum phos&shy;phate &gt;&nbsp;1.45mmol/L; see Section 23b.8 for more
discussion of abnormalities in serum phos&shy;phate

<h3 id="23b.4">23b.4   Phos&shy;phate balance  </h3>

Phos&shy;phate balance is the result of the
inter&shy;action of intes&shy;tinal absorption of
dietary phos&shy;phate, renal phos&shy;phate excretion, and
exchange of phos&shy;phate between
extra&shy;cellular and bone and intra&shy;cellular phos&shy;phate pools
(Figure&nbsp;23b-2.). At
present, the only easily available
parameter to study total body phos&shy;phate in a
clinical setting is to measure the
serum phos&shy;phate concen&shy;tration, usually in
the fasting state.  This measure&shy;ment
represents only a small portion of the
total body phos&shy;phate, as noted above,
and can also be affected by shifts of
phos&shy;phate between intra&shy;cellular and extra&shy;cellular
compart&shy;ments

Figure&nbsp;23b.2 The diagram illustrates
phos&shy;phorus balance maintained in a healthy
adult consuming an average American diet
containing 1400mg phos&shy;phate (Pi). The
com&shy;ponents of phos&shy;phorus or phos&shy;phate
balance, include intes&shy;tinal absorption,
kidney excretion, bone form&shy;ation/resorp&shy;tion, the
intra&shy;cellular space, and
plasma transport.  Under conditions of normal renal function,
the amount of Pi
absorbed equals the amount excreted in the urine,
thus balance is achieved in
an adult where bone form&shy;ation
equals bone resorp&shy;tion and tissue uptake equals
that released.

</figure>
<p></p>
The kidneys play a major role in phos&shy;phate balance
(<a href="#figure23b.2">Figure&nbsp;23b.2</a>)
by adjusting urinary
excretion (output) to match net gastro&shy;intes&shy;tinal
absorption (input) of
phos&shy;phate to maintain zero balance
in an adult or, to retain phos&shy;phate to
main&shy;tain positive balance in a
child for growth, or for a pregnancy. In healthy
subjects, the kidneys reabsorb about 89% of the
filtered load of phos&shy;phate,
with the rest being excreted in the urine.
Plasma phos&shy;phate filtered in the
glomerulus is mainly reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules (75%), with only
10% reabsorbed in the distal tubules, leaving
about 10&#8209;15% in the urine.
<p></p>
Gastro&shy;intestinal (GI) phos&shy;phate absorption in
humans has tradition&shy;ally been
measured as the difference between
dietary and fecal phos&shy;phate content; this
net phos&shy;phate absorption is a
linear function of dietary phos&shy;phate intake

For a dietary phos&shy;phate intake
within the range of 4&#8209;30mg/kg/day
(280&#8209;2100mg per day for an adult),
net absorption is about 60&#8209;65%.  Shown
in <a href="#figure23b.3">Figure23b.3</a>
are the two main transport
systems for intestinal phos&shy;phate
absorption: one is an active,
sodium-dependent, satur&shy;able and trans&shy;cellular
tran&shy;sporter, and the other is a passive, sodium-indepen&shy;dent, non-saturable and para&shy;cellular trans&shy;porter

The intestinal sodium-dependent
transporter is regulated by vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and is
often referred to as “active” transport.  In contrast, the paracellular
phos&shy;phorus absorption pathway lacks a tight regulation and depends on the
phos&shy;phate concent&shy;ration gradient
across the epi&shy;thelium, the electrical gradient
(lumen negative), and tight junction permeability

Most organic and inorganic phos&shy;phate is
absorbed in the small intestine after
liberation by gut and intes&shy;tinal enzymes. However,
the dominant plant source of
phos&shy;phate, phytate (Figure&nbsp;23b-1),
is poorly absorbed in humans because of lack
of the enzyme phytase. Many colonic bacteria
produce phytases (myo-inositol
hexa&shy;kis&shy;phos&shy;phate phos&shy;pho&shy;hydro&shy;lases) capable of
sequent&shy;ially hydro&shy;lyzing
phytate, releasing phos&shy;phate.
Liberated inorganic phos&shy;phate then has the
potential to be absorbed in the colon via para&shy;cellular
transport, although the
overall importance of this remains uncertain.
Increasing solidity of distal
colon fecal contents could potentially
make soluble phos&shy;phate less access&shy;ible
for para&shy;cellular absorption. Never&shy;the&shy;less,
a recent review concluded that at
least 50% of phos&shy;phate present in phytate
is recovered as phos&shy;phate in 24&#8209;hour
urine collections based on results of a
series of earlier human studies

<h3 id="23b.5">23b.5.  Hormonal regulation of serum phos&shy;phate</h3>

Serum phos&shy;phate concent&shy;ration
must be main&shy;tained within a very narrow range to
avoid adverse health con&shy;sequences and risk of disease such as soft tissue
calci&shy;fication or cardio&shy;vascular disease.
Regulation of serum phos&shy;phate involves
the inter&shy;play of four organs, phos&shy;phate membrane
trans&shy;porters bound in these
organs, and the actions of three endocrine
hormones that influence the activity
of the phos&shy;phate trans&shy;porters

<span data-tippy-content="Uribarri, J., & Calvo, M. S. (2023). Phosphorus. Chapter 8, 12th ed.   Modern Nutrition in Health & Disease (accepted for publication).

(<a href=""
target="right" >Uribarri & Calvo, 2023</a>)</span>.

The four major organs
involved in regulating serum phos&shy;phate
are the kidneys, bone, intestine, and
para&shy;thyroid glands.
There are two families of sodium-phos&shy;phate membrane
trans&shy;porters specific to these organs.
They include the SLC34 group of NaPi&#8209;2a,
b, c, chiefly located in the kidney and intestine,
and the SLC20 family (PiT&#8209;1
and 2) largely found in bone, intestine, soft tissue, muscle,
with some in the
kidney

<span data-tippy-content="Forster, I. C., Hernando, N., Biber, J., & Murer, H. (2013). Phosphate transporters of the SLC20 and SLC34 families. Molecular aspects of medicine, 34(2-3), 386–395.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23506879/"
target="right" >Forster et al., 2013</a>)</span>.

The activity of these two families of
sodium-phos&shy;phate membrane trans&shy;porters is
control&shy;led by three endo&shy;crine
hormones: para&shy;thyroid hormone (PTH), calcit&shy;riol
(1&#8209;25,dihydroxy&shy;chole&shy;calciferol;
(1&#8209;25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D),
the active meta&shy;bolite of vitamin&nbsp;D),
and fibro&shy;blast growth factor&nbsp;23 (FGF&#8209;23).
The three phos&shy;phate regu&shy;lating
hormones are endo&shy;crine hormones  meaning that they are secreted into the
circu&shy;lation by a specific organ, but act upon a distal organ.
<p></p>
As illustrated in
<a href="#figure23b.4">Figure&nbsp;23b.4,</a>
PTH is secreted by the para&shy;thyroid glands when
the rise in serum phos&shy;phate
triggers a decrease in serum ionized calcium or is
sufficiently elevated to directly stimulate PTH secretion. Circu&shy;lating PTH
rapidly acts to decrease NaPi&#8209;2a and
NaPi&#8209;2c co&#8209;trans&shy;porters in the renal
proximal and distal tubules. A decrease in
membrane co&#8209;trans&shy;porters acutely
decreases phos&shy;phate reabsorp&shy;tion
and increases phos&shy;phate excretion in the
urine.  When normal serum phos&shy;phate concent&shy;ration
is filtered in the glomerulus,
about 75% of phos&shy;phate is reabsorbed in the
proximal tubule and 10% from the
distal tubule with 10&#8209;15% lost in urine,
as noted earlier.

The action of PTH
rapidly lowers serum phos&shy;phate by increas&shy;ing
urinary loss, and rapidly increases
serum calcium and to a lesser
degree phos&shy;phate by stimulating bone resorption.
PTH action more slowly restores serum
calcium through up&#8209;regu&shy;lation of the renal
cyto&shy;chrome enzyme <i>Cyp27b1</i> that catalyzes the activ&shy;ation
of 25&#8209;hydroxy vitamin&nbsp;D
to the active meta&shy;bolite, calcitriol (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D)
secreted by the kidney into
the circu&shy;lation. In turn,
the circu&shy;lating hormonal form of vitamin&nbsp;D,
calcitriol, acts on the small intestine to increase active calcium transport,
thus PTH rapidly corrects serum phos&shy;phate
and calcium concent&shy;rations that stray
from the normal range

When excessive intake of phos&shy;phate is
sustained over time, or kidney function
fails resulting in hyperphos&shy;phatemia,
hormonal control of serum phos&shy;phate is
reliant on regu&shy;lating intestinal phos&shy;phate
absorp&shy;tion and renal tubular
phos&shy;phate reabsorp&shy;tion and may require
the action of the bone secreted hormone
FGF&#8209;23

<span data-tippy-content="Rausch, S., & Föller, M. (2022). The regulation of FGF23 under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology, 474(3), 281–292.">

In response to hyper&shy;phos&shy;phatemia, FGF&#8209;23 is
secreted by osteo&shy;cytes in bone and similar to PTH,
FGF&#8209;23 acts to suppress
co-trans&shy;porter action (proximal tubule NaPi&#8209;2a
and NaPi&#8209;2c),  decreasing renal
reabsorp&shy;tion and increasing urinary phos&shy;phate
excre&shy;tion but acts to supress PTH
secre&shy;tion (not shown) .
In contrast to the action of PTH, FGF&#8209;23
inhibits 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy vitamin&nbsp;D renal synthesis and
intestinal phos&shy;phate absorption by
down&shy;regu&shy;lating renal <i>cytochrome P450 (Cyp27b1)</i>
expression (the key enzyme for
calcitriol produc&shy;tion), and enhanc&shy;ing renal <i>Cyp24a1</i>
produc&shy;tion, thus catalyzing
the inactivation of 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy vitamin&nbsp;D.
<p></p>
FGF-23 action may
be depend&shy;ent or independ&shy;ent of Klotho,
a beta&#8209;glu&shy;curoni&shy;dase
enzyme that occurs as both a trans&shy;membrane
protein and a sec&shy;reted renal protein,
and which can function as a co&#8209;receptor to FGF&#8209;23
(not shown in Figure&nbsp;23b.4).
Although many of Klotho's functions remain unclear,
it has a proven role in
phos&shy;phate regulation

<span data-tippy-content="Kuro-O M. (2019). The Klotho proteins in health and disease. Nature reviews. Nephrology, 15(1), 27–44.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30455427/"
target="right" >Kuro-O, 2019</a>)</span>.

FGF&#8209;23 clearly suppresses cal&shy;citriol
synthesis and, with time, PTH secretion; however,
initially in response to high
serum phos&shy;phate, PTH is believed to
stimulate FGF&#8209;23 secretion from osteocytes

<span data-tippy-content="Rausch, S., & Föller, M. (2022). The regulation of FGF23 under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology, 474(3), 281–292.">

Not shown in the simplified diagram of hormonal
control of serum phos&shy;phate (Figure&nbsp;23b.4),
calcitriol upregulates Na-Pi
co-trans&shy;porters (an action opposite to that
of FGF&#8209;23) in both the intes&shy;tine and
proximal renal tubules which leads to both increased
intes&shy;tinal absorption of
phos&shy;phate and increased renal phos&shy;phate reabsorp&shy;tion.
Calcitriol suppresses PTH
secretion and has a negative feedback action on
renal 1&#8209;alpha hydroxy&shy;lase
<i>(Cyp27b1)</i>, thereby reducing its
own produc&shy;tion. With lower calcitriol
concent&shy;rations, 24&#8209;hydrolxy&shy;lase is upreg&shy;ulated,
increasing the production of 24,25&#8209;dihy&shy;droxy vitamin&nbsp;D
effectively inactiv&shy;ating calcitriol hormonal action.

<h3 id="23b.6">23b.6 Nutrient reference values</h3>

In 1997, the Institute of Medicine (U.S. and Canada) determined adult age

values for phos&shy;phorus derived from
studies using serum phos&shy;phorus as a
biomarker

For adults 19&#8209;50
years, the EAR was based on the relation&shy;ship
between serum phos&shy;phate and
absorbed intake determined from earlier published data.
This relation&shy;ship was
then used to translate absorbed intake to the
amount of ingested phos&shy;phorus
based on an assumed efficiency of absorption of
62.5% from a mixed diet not high
in phytate

An intake of phos&shy;phorus of 580mg/d meets
the needs of 50% of the adult population (&ge;&nbsp;19y)

A tolerable upper intake level (UL) for phos&shy;phate
was also set in 1997 as part of the
Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The UL is considered to be a safe
intake level, but as intake increases above the UL, risk for adverse events
increases

The increased use of phos&shy;phate-contain&shy;ing food

Current mean dietary phos&shy;phate intakes of
Americans are 2&#8209;3-fold higher than the
RDA for all age groups &gt;&nbsp;1y
(with the single exception of rapidly growing
adolescents), but do not exceed the current UL.
None&shy;the&shy;less, excess phos&shy;phate
intake is assoc&shy;iated with growing evidence of poten&shy;tial
non&shy;com&shy;munic&shy;able disease
risk. This is of concern especially when consid&shy;ering the high intakes of
bio&shy;avail&shy;able phos&shy;phate that
may occur from the consumption of ultra-pro&shy;cessed

should be given to revising the 1997 DRI’s

<h3 id="23b.7">23b.7 Dietary sources</h3>

Dietary sources of phos&shy;phate include both organic and
inor&shy;ganic phos&shy;phate.
Phos&shy;phate is present in most food sources and is
usually highest in animal
protein compared to plant protein sources.
Import&shy;antly, the bio&shy;avail&shy;ability
of phos&shy;phorus differs between
protein derived from animal sources compared to
plant derived protein. In addition
to con&shy;tain&shy;ing protein, plants store phos&shy;phate
as phytate (Figure&nbsp;23b.1).
Phos&shy;phate  is stored as phytate in unrefined cereals,
oil seeds, and legumes that requires
enzym&shy;atic or physical action to release
phos&shy;phate bound to phytate.
Bioavailability of phytate-phos&shy;phorus is low unless
foods are processed using home-based methods
such as soaking, germin&shy;ation, or
ferment&shy;ation, or com&shy;mercial
methods such as canning and extrusion

all of which having the potential
to improve phos&shy;phate avail&shy;ability from
phytate. While these methods of proces&shy;sing
improve phos&shy;phate avail&shy;ability from
phytate, commercial processing leading to proces&shy;sed
and ultra-processed foods
may involve the addition of phos&shy;phate-containing
additives that provide highly
available sources of phos&shy;phate, such as
sodium phos&shy;phate salts

As can be seen in
<a href="#table23b.3">Table&nbsp;23b.3</a>, it is difficult to describe
dietary sources of phos&shy;phate as high or low
without information on the source
and form of phos&shy;phate, and their relative
bio&shy;avail&shy;ability. In general, both
plant and animal protein sources are
good sources as noted earlier. In addition,
the phytate-phos&shy;phorus present
mainly in unre&shy;fined cereals, oil seeds, and
legumes may become bio&shy;avail&shy;able,
if  during proces&shy;sing phytate has been
hydro&shy;lyzed, and phos&shy;phate bound to
phytate released prior to absorp&shy;tion. Under
the Nova classification, raw and minimally processed
phytate rich plant foods
have lower phos&shy;phorus bioavailability
than compar&shy;ably proces&shy;sed animal protein
sources

<p></p>
In minimally processed and unprocessed foods (Group 1, figure 23b.3), 
the estimated percent phosphate absorption varies from less than 40% to 70%
being generally lower in plant foods and higher in animal foods.
There is very little data on the estimated phosphate absorption from processed
culinary ingredients, but processed foods (Group 3, figure 23b.3) consumed as part of
a mixed diet, can have an estimated percent phosphate absorption of greater than 60%. 
The absorptionn in ultra-processed (Group 4, figure 23b.3), 
animal foods may range from 90-100% but is lower in
ultra-processed plant foods.
<p></p>
The presence of phos&shy;phate additives in
minimally and ultra&shy;proces&shy;sed foods (shown
in Table 23b.3 by&nbsp;*) may or may not
show differences in total phos&shy;phate content
compared to unpro&shy;cessed foods if the
content estimates are based on national
nutrient content database inform&shy;ation

There is a lack of accounting for the
phos&shy;phorus contrib&shy;ution by phos&shy;phate additives in
most foods in the nutrient content data&shy;bases
resulting in a widely recog&shy;nized
under&shy;estim&shy;ation of phos&shy;phorus
intake

Regret&shy;tably, many inves&shy;tigators
have only recently discovered the need to
directly analyze the phos&shy;phate content of the
foods fed in studies to accurately
design clinical trials examining
dietary phos&shy;phate meta&shy;bolism

<p></p>
The phos&shy;phorus content of packaged foods
in the US and Canada does not require
phos&shy;phorus content to be listed on the label;
however, if phos&shy;phate additives
were added, then their use must be identified
but not quant&shy;ified in the label
ingred&shy;ients list

<span data-tippy-content="Calvo, M. S., Sherman, R. A., & Uribarri, J. (2019). Dietary Phosphate and the Forgotten Kidney Patient: A Critical Need for FDA Regulatory Action. American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation, 73(4), 542–551.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30686528/"
target="right" >Calvo et al., 2019</a>)</span>.

The US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) requires that
all ingred&shy;ients (additives) added to food
during processing must have prior
approval for use in one of the 32&nbsp;specific
technical functions recognized by the FDA.
Phos&shy;phate-con&shy;tain&shy;ing addit&shy;ives and
processed protein ingred&shy;ients
(isolates and hydroly&shy;sates) are approved for at
least 26&nbsp;of&nbsp;these technical func&shy;tions.
Processed foods often contain one or more
phos&shy;phate additives

<span data-tippy-content="Sullivan, C. M., Leon, J. B., & Sehgal, A. R. (2007). Phosphorus-containing food additives and the accuracy of nutrient databases: implications for renal patients.

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17720105/"
target="right" >Sullivan et al., 2007</a>)</span>,

because the more frequ&shy;ently used
additives are approved for more than one tech&shy;nical function.
For example, of the
more than 60&nbsp;frequ&shy;ently used phos&shy;phate addi&shy;tives more than
30&nbsp;are approved for
use as a nutrient supplement, 24&nbsp;for use as
a stabil&shy;izer or thick&shy;ener, 20&nbsp;as
emuls&shy;ifiers and emuls&shy;ifier salts and 18&nbsp;as
pH control agents. Under&shy;standing the
role of dietary phos&shy;phate intake in
chronic disease risk requires better
under&shy;standing of the role of phos&shy;phate additives
in food proces&shy;sing as phos&shy;phate
additives can be added to foods for multiple functions,
each contributing to
higher phos&shy;phate content which is not
always captured by the basic tools used by
nutrit&shy;ional scien&shy;tists to determine total
phos&shy;phate intake. A simple solution to
this inaccuracy in the nutrient content
data&shy;bases is to require phos&shy;phorus
content on the Nutrient Facts Label

<h3 id="23b.8">23b.8 Abnormalities in serum phos&shy;phate</h3>

Phos&shy;phate balance, a proxy for
assessing phos&shy;phate nutritional status, is best
assessed by measur&shy;ing fasting serum phos&shy;phate concent&shy;rations.
Nevertheless, single fasting serum phos&shy;phate measures do not always
reflect the body phos&shy;phate stores
because acute shifts of phos&shy;phate between body
compart&shy;ments may tempor&shy;arily
affect serum phos&shy;phate without affecting total body
phos&shy;phorus content.

Trans&shy;cellular phos&shy;phate shifts such as
those occurring with acute alkalosis can

the intra&shy;cellular shift of phos&shy;phate,
even though the total body phos&shy;phate content is

usually transient in nature; however,
when hyper&shy;phos&shy;phatemia or hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia

<h3 id="23b.10">23b.10 Inherited and tumor-induced disorders
of phos&shy;phate metabolism </h3>

Genetic-related disorders of phos&shy;phate meta&shy;bolism , notably chronic
hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia, are very rare in
most populations, Moreover, they are
unrelated to dietary phos&shy;phate intakes,
unlike the disorders associated with
excessive phos&shy;phate intakes.
These genetic phos&shy;phate disorders include X&#8209;Linked
Hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemic Rickets (XLH);
Auto&shy;somal-dom&shy;inant Hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemic Rickets
(ADHR); Auto&shy;somal Reces&shy;sive
Hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemic Rickets (ARHR), and Hereditary
Hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemic Rickets with Hyper&shy;calciuria (HHRH).
They are inherited diseases
or result from missense muta&shy;tions
which all impact FGF&#8209;23 metabolism, by either
increasing circu&shy;lating levels of the
hormone or its activity, which ultimately
lead to hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia
arising from phos&shy;phate wasting (i.e., excessive urinary
phos&shy;phate excretion in relation to serum phos&shy;phate level).
Sustained hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia can mani&shy;fest as rickets in children
and osteo&shy;malacia in adults
but can be treated with oral phos&shy;phate sup&shy;plement&shy;ation,
and more recently with
biologics that block FGF&#8209;23 renal hormone action

target="right" >Athonvarangkul & Insogna, 2021</a>)</span>.

<p></p>
Tumor-induced osteo&shy;malacia (also known as oncogenic
osteo&shy;malacia) is also a
disorder of phos&shy;phate wasting,
but it is not inherited, instead stemming from
excessive levels of FGF&#8209;23 secreted by tumors.
Such excessive levels of FGF&#8209;23
again promote renal phos&shy;phate wasting
resulting in under-mineral&shy;ized bone
(osteo&shy;malacia), bone pain, fractures, and
muscle weakness in adults
