<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

The essential nutrient phos&shy;phorus
(in nature occurring as phos&shy;phate) is
ubiquitous in all the foods we eat, the human
body and, in effect, all living organisms.
phos&shy;phate is critical to structural and
biochemical functions needed to secure
energy, reproduce and grow.  Most of the
body's phos&shy;phate is contained within bones,
teeth, membranes and intracellular spaces;
however, it is the 1% present in the
extracellular space, serum that is clinically
measured to inform about physiologic and
nutritional phos&shy;phate status.  
<p></p>
Serum phos&shy;phate in healthy individuals usually
reflects phos&shy;phate balance that is main&shy;tained
within a narrow range by hormonal control of
renal reabsorption and excretion and
intes&shy;tinal absorption when dietary phos&shy;phate
intakes are low or excessive.  Regu&shy;lation of
serum phos&shy;phate involves the inter&shy;play of
four organs (kidneys, intestine, bone and
parathyroid glands), phos&shy;phate trans&shy;porters
membrane bound in these organs, and the
actions of three endo&shy;crine hormones
(para&shy;thyroid hormone, calcitriol the active
form of vita&shy;min&nbsp;D, and bone-secreted
fibro&shy;blast growth factor&#8209;23 (FGF&#8209;23), all of which
influence the activity of the phos&shy;phate
trans&shy;porters to increase or decrease
absorption, reabsor&shy;ption or excretion of
phos&shy;phate.  
<p></p>
Hyperphos&shy;phatemia, serum
phos&shy;phate &gt;&nbsp;1.45mmol/L, is often related to
excess dietary phos&shy;phate intake with
consumption of phos&shy;phate additive-rich
processed foods or the typical Western diets
when kidney function is impaired.  Higher
serum phos&shy;phate has been associated with
disruption of endo&shy;crine pathways that may
link high phos&shy;phate intake with pathology
associated with chronic disease risk
including cardio&shy;vascular disease.  In
contrast, hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia, &lt;&nbsp;0.87mmol/L, is
rarely related to dietary deficiency of
phos&shy;phate except in cases of severe
malnutrition and more likely due to inborn
errors of metabolism or tumor production of
excess FGF&#8209;23 that causes renal phos&shy;phate
wasting and bone disease (rickets and osteo&shy;malacia).

<h3 id="23b.1">23b.1 phos&shy;phorus</h3>

phos&shy;phorus is the 11<sup>th</sup> most abundant 
element yet phos&shy;phorus is not present in 
nature as elemental phos&shy;phorus, instead occurring 
mainly bound to oxygen as 
phos&shy;phate (Ferro, 2018). Deposits of phos&shy;phate-rich
rock in the earth's 
crust slowly release phos&shy;phate which builds 
up in soils over time, entering the 
food chain via soil microbes, and then crops, livestock, and other components 
of the human food supply.  However, deposits of rocks rich in phos&shy;phate are 
limited across the globe. When mined, these phos&shy;phate 
deposits are largely used 
as fertilizers for crop growth (Ferro, 2018). 
<p></p>
Phos&shy;phorus is often the key growth-limiting 
factor for all living things. As an 
essential nutrient, phos&shy;phorus functions in critical pathways and cellular 
components in all life forms on earth, ranging from subcellular viruses to 
complex plants and animals, all dependent on phos&shy;phate for energy, growth, 
reproduction, structure, and homeo&shy;stasis facilitated through signal 
transduction. phos&shy;phates participate in all biological processes providing 
energy stored in phos&shy;phodiester bonds of 
ATP (the phos&shy;phodiester backbone of 
RNA and DNA). Other functional roles include the structural integrity of cell 
membranes as phos&shy;pholipids, regulation of acid 
base balance, mineral&shy;ization of 
teeth and bones, lipid transport in blood, and   signalling pathways essential 
to main&shy;taining phos&shy;phate homeo&shy;stasis. 
As phos&shy;phate has such a critical role in 
so many biological processes, phos&shy;phate homeo&shy;stasis 
must be tightly regulated. 
In conditions when sources of phos&shy;phate are 
deficient, growth or reproduction 
is limited, whereas with excess, toxicity may  occur, which in humans may 
manifest as disease  (Hernando, 2021). 

<h3 id="23b.2">23b.2 Biological Forms of phos&shy;phate and 
their measurement</h3>

The three forms of phos&shy;phorus bound
to oxygen that occur in nature are shown in

an ionic anion, an inorganic salt, and as an organic compound, using phytate as 
the example. Inorganic or mineral phos&shy;phate largely comprises the different 
salts of ortho&shy;phos&shy;phate that occur in 
greater abundance than pyrophos&shy;phate. 
Within the pH range of the human body, 
the two main forms of ortho&shy;phos&shy;phates 
are H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-1</sup> and HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>. 
The organic form of phos&shy;phate occur when bound to a 
carbon atom of protein, lipids, nucleic acids, and other organic compounds, 
usually through phos&shy;phate ester 
linkages. The total body phos&shy;phate content in 
an adult human is about 900g of
elemental phos&shy;phorus, existing mainly in the 
skeleton and teeth, with less amounts in soft tissues.
<p></p>
The phos&shy;phate in bone and teeth is 
present as calcium phos&shy;phate hydroxy&shy;apatite
(Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>). 
Less than 1% of phos&shy;phorus occurs in the 
extra&shy;cellular space. Intra&shy;cellular 
phos&shy;phate consists largely of organic 
molecules such as creatine phos&shy;phate, ATP, 
nucleic acids, phos&shy;pholipids and 
phos&shy;pho&shy;proteins in concen&shy;trations of phos&shy;phate of 
about 1mmol/L.
<p></p>
Clinically, the terms phos&shy;phate 
and phos&shy;phorus are used interchangeably. 
However, because elemental phos&shy;phorus does not occur in the human body, 
phos&shy;phorus is usually measured 
asmg phos&shy;phate and can be converted to molar P 
concent&shy;ration by dividing the measured weight 
inmg by the atomic weight of P (31).

<h3 id="23b.3">23b.3 Interpretive Criterion: Serum phos&shy;phate</h3>

Serum phos&shy;phate is the most frequently 
used bio&shy;marker of phos&shy;phorus status in a 
clinical setting, and is usually measured in the fasting state. However, the 
measure&shy;ment of a single fasting 
serum  phos&shy;phate concen&shy;tration represents only 
a small portion of the total 
body phos&shy;phate, and hence does not always reflect 
the body  phos&shy;phate stores. Measure&shy;ment 
of serum or plasma phos&shy;phate 
concen&shy;tration requires the use of anti&shy;coagulants 
such as heparin which do not 
interfere with the color reaction described for 
the AOAC spectro&shy;photo&shy;metric 
method described in 23b.2. Hemolyzed samples are not 
suitable for phos&shy;phate 
measure&shy;ment as erythro&shy;cyte phos&shy;phate confounds 
the measure&shy;ment and hemo&shy;globin 
contributes color inter&shy;ference. 
Serum phos&shy;phate concen&shy;trations can also 
be affected tempor&shy;arily by acute shifts 
of phos&shy;phate between 
intra&shy;cellular and extra&shy;cellular compart&shy;ments without 
affecting total body content (Uribarri & Oh, 2018).
<p><p>
Serum phos&shy;phate concen&shy;trations are main&shy;tained 
within a narrow range (see 
Section 23b.5 for details of the 
hormonal regulation of serum phos&shy;phate).  
In adults, total serum inorganic phos&shy;phate ranges 
between 0.87-1.45mmol/L (56% is 
ionized, 20% bound to protein and 24% bound to other cations); however, there 
is a signif&shy;icant amount of organic phos&shy;phate in 
serum (7.5&ndash;8.0mg/dL or 2.4&ndash;2.6mmol/L) which is not 
included in the analytical method used by clinical 
laboratories. When serum phos&shy;phate concen&shy;trations 
fall below the normal range, 
a condition called hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia occurs, 
whereas for concen&shy;trations above 
the normal range, hyper&shy;phos&shy;phatemia develops; 
serious clinical con&shy;sequences can 
arise from both conditions.
<p></p>
Several factors affect serum  phos&shy;phate concen&shy;trations.  
Diurnal variation in 
serum phos&shy;phate occurs with concen&shy;trations 
lowest at 9AM and highest at 7PM.
There is also a seasonal variation, whereby levels are 
higher during the summer 
than during the winter; this may arise 
because phos&shy;phorus absorption is 
stimulated by the greater synthesis of vitamin&#8209;D 
with higher summer sunlight 
exposure. Serum phos&shy;phate is also 
higher in women than in men (by about 0.31mg/dL, 
0.1mmol/L), and higher in children (i.e., normal range 1.45&ndash;1.78mmol/L) 
than adults (i.e., normal range 0.87&ndash;1.45mmol/L); see Table 23b.1.  
<p></p>
Normal serum phos&shy;phate values for 
children and adults are shown in Table 23b.1. 
Hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia is usually 
defined as serum phos&shy;phate &lt;&nbsp;0.87mmol/L and 
hyperphos&shy;phatemia as a 
serum phos&shy;phate &gt;&nbsp;1.45mmol/L; see Section 23b.8 for more 
discussion of abnormalities in serum phos&shy;phate (Koumakis et al., 20210). 

<h3 id="23b.4">23b.4   phos&shy;phate Balance  </h3> 

Phos&shy;phate balance is the result of the 
inter&shy;action of intes&shy;tinal absorption of 
dietary phos&shy;phate, renal phos&shy;phate excretion, and 
exchange of phos&shy;phate between 
extra&shy;cellular and bone and intra&shy;cellular phos&shy;phate pools 
(Figure&nbsp;23b-2.). At 
present, the only easily available 
parameter to study total body phos&shy;phate in a 
clinical setting is to measure the 
serum phos&shy;phate concen&shy;tration, usually in 
the fasting state.  This measure&shy;ment 
represents only a small portion of the 
total body phos&shy;phate, as noted above, 
and can also be affected by shifts of 
phos&shy;phate between intra&shy;cellular and extra&shy;cellular compart&shy;
ments (Uribarri & Oh, 2018).

Figure&nbsp;23b.2 The diagram illustrates 
phos&shy;phorus balance maintained in a healthy 
adult consuming an average American diet 
containing 1400mg phos&shy;phate (Pi). The 
com&shy;ponents of phos&shy;phorus or phos&shy;phate 
balance, include intes&shy;tinal absorption, 
kidney excretion, bone form&shy;ation/resorp&shy;tion, the 
intra&shy;cellular space, and 
plasma transport.  Under conditions of normal renal function, 
the amount of Pi 
absorbed equals the amount excreted in the urine, 
thus balance is achieved in 
an adult where bone form&shy;ation 
equals bone resorp&shy;tion and tissue uptake equals 
that released.  
</figcaption>
</figure> 
<p></p>
The kidneys play a major role in phos&shy;phate balance by adjusting urinary 
excretion (output) to match net gastro&shy;intes&shy;tinal 
absorption (input) of 
phos&shy;phate to maintain zero balance 
in an adult or, to retain phos&shy;phate to 
main&shy;tain positive balance in a 
child for growth, or for a pregnancy. In healthy 
subjects, the kidneys reabsorb about 89% of the 
filtered load of phos&shy;phate, 
with the rest being excreted in the urine. 
Plasma phos&shy;phate filtered in the 
glomerulus is mainly reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules (75%), with only 
10% reabsorbed in the distal tubules, leaving 
about 10&ndash;15% in the urine.
<p></p>
Gastro&shy;intestinal (GI) phos&shy;phate absorption in 
humans has tradition&shy;ally been 
measured as the difference between 
dietary and fecal phos&shy;phate content; this 
net phos&shy;phate absorption is a 
linear function of dietary phos&shy;phate intake (IOM, 
1997). For a dietary phos&shy;phate intake 
within the range of 4&ndash;30mg/kg/day 
(280&ndash;2100mg per day for an adult), 
net absorption is about 60&ndash;65%.  Shown 
in Figure&nbsp;23b.3, there are two main transport 
systems for intestinal phos&shy;phate 
absorption: one is an active, 
sodium-dependent, satur&shy;able and trans&shy;cellular 
transporter, and the other is a passive, sodium-independent, non-saturable and 
paracellular transporter (Marks, 2019). The intestinal sodium-dependent 
transporter is regulated by vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and is 
often referred to as “active” transport.  In contrast, the paracellular 
phos&shy;phorus absorption pathway lacks a tight regulation and depends on the 
phos&shy;phate concent&shy;ration gradient 
across the epi&shy;thelium, the electrical gradient 
(lumen negative), and tight junction permeability (Calvo & Uribarri, 2021).

Figure&nbsp;23b.3 Mechanisms of Intestinal
phos&shy;phate Absorption (Modified from Marks,
2019)  
</figcaption>
</figure>

Most organic and inorganic phos&shy;phate is 
absorbed in the small intestine after 
liberation by gut and intes&shy;tinal enzymes. However, 
the dominant plant source of 
phos&shy;phate, phytate (Figure&nbsp;23b-1), 
is poorly absorbed in humans because of lack 
of the enzyme phytase. Many colonic bacteria 
produce phytases (myo-inositol 
hexa&shy;kis&shy;phos&shy;phate phos&shy;pho&shy;hydro&shy;lases) capable of 
sequent&shy;ially hydro&shy;lyzing 
phytate, releasing phos&shy;phate. 
Liberated inorganic phos&shy;phate then has the 
potential to be absorbed in the colon via para&shy;cellular 
transport, although the 
overall importance of this remains uncertain. 
Increasing solidity of distal 
colon fecal contents could potentially 
make soluble phos&shy;phate less access&shy;ible 
for para&shy;cellular absorption. Never&shy;the&shy;less, 
a recent review concluded that at 
least 50% of phos&shy;phate present in phytate 
is recovered as phos&shy;phate in 24&#8209;hour 
urine collections based on results of a 
series of earlier human studies 
(Calvo & Uribarri, 2021).

<h3 id="23b.5">23b.5.  Hormonal Regulation of Serum phos&shy;phate</h3>

Serum phos&shy;phate concent&shy;ration 
must be main&shy;tained within a very narrow range to 
avoid adverse health con&shy;sequences and risk of disease such as soft tissue 
calci&shy;fication or cardio&shy;vascular disease. 
Regulation of serum phos&shy;phate involves 
the inter&shy;play of four organs, phos&shy;phate 
trans&shy;porters membrane bound in these 
organs, and the actions of three endocrine 
hormones that influence the activity 
of the phos&shy;phate transporters (Uribarri & Calvo, 2023).  
The four major organs 
involved in regulating serum phos&shy;phate 
are the kidneys, bone, intestine, and 
para&shy;thyroid glands.  
There are two families of sodium-phos&shy;phate membrane 
trans&shy;porters specific to these organs. 
They include the SLC34 group of NaPi&#8209;2a, 
b, c, chiefly located in the kidney and intestine, 
and the SLC20 family (PiT&#8209;1 
and 2) largely found in bone, intestine, soft tissue, muscle, 
with some in the 
kidney (Forester et al. 2013). The activity of these two families of 
sodium-phos&shy;phate membrane transVporters is 
control&shy;led by  three endo&shy;crine 
hormones: para&shy;thyroid hormone (PTH), calcit&shy;riol 
(1-&#8209;25,dihydroxy&shy;chole&shy;calciferol;  
(1&#8209;25(OH)<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;D), 
the active meta&shy;bolite of vitamin&nbsp;D), 
and fibro&shy;blast growth factor&nbsp;23 (FGF&#8209;23).   
The three phos&shy;phate regu&shy;lating 
hormones are endo&shy;crine hormones  meaning that they are secreted into the 
circu&shy;lation by a specific organ, but act upon a distal organ. 
<p></p>
As illustrated in 
<a href="#figure23b.4">Figure&nbsp;23b.4,</a>
PTH is secreted by the para&shy;thyroid glands when 
the rise in serum phos&shy;phate 
triggers a decrease in serum ionized calcium or is 
sufficiently elevated to directly stimulate PTH secretion. Circu&shy;lating PTH 
rapidly acts to decrease NaPi&#8209;2a and 
NaPi&#8209;2c co&#8209;trans&shy;porters in the renal 
proximal and distal tubules. A decrease in 
membrane co&#8209;trans&shy;porters acutely 
decreases phos&shy;phate reabsorp&shy;tion 
and increases phos&shy;phate excretion in the 
urine.  When normal, serum phos&shy;phate concent&shy;ration 
is filtered in the glomerulus, 
about 75% of phos&shy;phate is reabsorbed in the 
proximal tubule and 10% from the 
distal tubule with 10&ndash;15% lost in urine, 
as noted earlier.

<a id="figure23b.4"></a>
<figure style="width: 50%">

<figcaption class="cap">
Figure&nbsp;23b.4 Stimulatory pathways in the diagram are shown by dashed lines 
and inhibitory pathways by solid lines in red for hyperphos&shy;phatemia, purple for 
PTH, black for FGF-23 and blue for 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (calcitriol). 
</figcaption>
</figure>
 
The action of PTH 
rapidly lowers serum phos&shy;phate by increas&shy;ing 
urinary loss, and rapidly increases 
serum calcium and to a lesser 
degree phos&shy;phate by stimulating bone resorption  
PTH action more slowly restores serum 
calcium through up&#8209;regu&shy;lation of the renal 
cyto&shy;chrome enzyme Cyp27b1 that catalyzes the activ&shy;ation 
of 25&#8209;hydroxy vitamin&nbsp;D 
to the active meta&shy;bolite, calcitriol (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D) 
secreted by the kidney into 
the circu&shy;lation. In turn, 
the circu&shy;lating hormonal form of vitamin&nbsp;D, 
calcitriol, acts on the small intestine to increase active calcium transport, 
thus PTH rapidly corrects serum phos&shy;phate 
and calcium concent&shy;rations that stray 
from the normal range (Uribarri & Calvo, 2023). 
<p></p>
When excessive intake of phos&shy;phate is 
sustained over time, or kidney function 
fails resulting in hyperphos&shy;phatemia, 
hormonal control of serum phos&shy;phate is 
reliant on regu&shy;lating intestinal phos&shy;phate 
absorp&shy;tion and renal tubular 
phos&shy;phate reabsorp&shy;tion and may require 
the action of the bone secreted hormone 
FGF&#8209;23 (Rausch & Foeller, 2022). 
In response to hyper&shy;phos&shy;phatemia, FGF&#8209;23 is 
secreted by osteo&shy;cytes in bone and similar to PTH, 
FGF&#8209;23 acts to suppress 
co-trans&shy;porter action (proximal tubule NaPi&#8209;2a 
and NaPi&#8209;2c),  decreasing renal 
reabsorp&shy;tion and increasing urinary phos&shy;phate 
excre&shy;tion but acts to supress PTH 
secre&shy;tion (not shown) . 
In contrast to the action of PTH, FGF&#8209;23 
inhibits 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy vitamin&nbsp;D renal synthesis and 
intestinal phos&shy;phate absorption by 
down&shy;regu&shy;lating renal cytochrome P450 (Cyp27b1) 
expression (the key enzyme for 
calcitriol produc&shy;tion), and enhanc&shy;ing renal Cyp24a1 
produc&shy;tion, thus catalyzing 
the inactivation of 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy vitamin&nbsp;D.
<p></p>
FGF-23 action may 
be depend&shy;ent or independ&shy;ent of Klotho, 
a beta&#8209;glu&shy;curoni&shy;dase 
enzyme that occurs as both a trans&shy;membrane 
protein and a sec&shy;reted renal protein, 
and which can function as a co&#8209;receptor to FGF&#8209;23 
(not shown in Figure&nbsp;23b.4). 
Although many of Klotho's functions remain unclear, 
it has a proven role in 
phos&shy;phate regulation (Kuro-O, 2019). 
FGF&#8209;23 clearly suppresses cal&shy;citriol 
synthesis and, with time, PTH secretion; however, 
initially in response to high 
serum phos&shy;phate, PTH is believed to 
stimulate FGF&#8209;23 secretion from osteocytes 
(Rausch & Foeller, 2022). 
Not shown in the simplified diagram of hormonal 
control of serum phos&shy;phate (Figure&nbsp;23b.4), 
calcitriol upregulates Na-Pi 
co-trans&shy;porters (an action opposite to that 
of FGF&#8209;23) in both the intes&shy;tine and 
proximal renal tubules which leads to both increased 
intes&shy;tinal absorption of 
phos&shy;phate and increased renal phos&shy;phate reabsorp&shy;tion. 
Calcitriol suppresses PTH 
secretion and has a negative feedback action on 
renal 1&#8209;alpha hydroxy&shy;lase 
(Cyp27b1), thereby reducing its own produc&shy;tion. With lower calcitriol 
concent&shy;rations, 24&#8209;hydrolxy&shy;lase is upreg&shy;ulated, 
increasing the production of 24,25&#8209;dihy&shy;droxy vitamin&nbsp;D 
effectively inactiv&shy;ating calcitriol hormonal action.

<h3 id="23b.6">23b.6 Nutrient Reference Values</h3> 

In 1997, the Institute of Medicine (U.S. and Canada) determined adult age 
specific Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) 
values for phos&shy;phorus derived from 
studies using serum phos&shy;phorus as a 
biomarker (IOM, 1997). For adults 19&ndash;50 
years, the EAR was based on the relation&shy;ship 
between serum phos&shy;phate and 
absorbed intake determined from earlier published data. 
This relation&shy;ship was 
then used to translate absorbed intake to the 
amount of ingested phos&shy;phorus 
based on an assumed efficiency of absorption of 
62.5% from a mixed diet not high 
in phytate (Calvo & Whiting, 2018).  
An intake of phos&shy;phorus of 580mg/d meets 
the needs of 50% of the adult population (&ge;&nbsp;19y) 
and therefore was set as the 
EAR and served as the basis for determining the 
Recommended Daily Allowance 
(RDA) for phos&shy;phate that covers the phos&shy;phorus needs of 97% of the 
adult population. 
For children, the biomarker used to set the EAR for dietary phos&shy;phorus 
intake was based on published factorial estimates of 
accretion of phos&shy;phate into 
bone; see IOM (1997) for more details. For infants, the AI was set to reflect 
the observed mean intakes of infants fed principally with human milk (IOM, 
1997).

children and adults by age 
and sex, and for  the physiologic states of pregnancy and lactation recommended

A tolerable upper intake level (UL) for phos&shy;phate 
was also set in 1997 as part of the 
Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The UL is considered to be a safe 
intake level, but as intake increases above the UL, risk for adverse events 
increases (IOM, 1997).  The  UL for adults is set at 4000mg/d. 
Research&shy;ers now 
question the method used by the IOM 
panel that set a value nearly six times higher 
than the RDA for phos&shy;phorus is in 
question, suggesting a need to revisit the UL 
(Whiting & Calvo, 2018).  The increased 
use of phos&shy;phate-contain&shy;ing food 
additives in processing led the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to 
reassess the safety of phos&shy;phate additives 
and cumu&shy;lative phos&shy;phate intakes. The 
2019 EFSA review resulted in a revision of 
the &ldquo;group acceptable daily intake&rdquo;
(ADI) of 4.2g phos&shy;phate per day to the 
lower value of 2.8g phos&shy;phate per day 
for an average 70kg adult (EFSA, 2019). 
<p></p>

Current mean dietary phos&shy;phate intakes of 
Americans are 2&ndash;3-fold higher than the 
RDA for all age groups &gt;&nbsp;1y 
(with the single exception of rapidly growing 
adolescents), but do not exceed the current UL.  
None&shy;the&shy;less, excess phos&shy;phate 
intake is assoc&shy;iated with growing evidence of poten&shy;tial 
non&shy;com&shy;munic&shy;able disease 
risk. This is of concern especially when consid&shy;ering the high intakes of 
bio&shy;avail&shy;able phos&shy;phate that 
may occur from the consumption of ultra-pro&shy;cessed 
foods. Con&shy;sequently, con&shy;sider&shy;ation 
should be given to revising the 1997 DRI’s 
(notably the UL) (Uribarri &Calvo, 2022).

<h3 id="23b.7">23b.7 Dietary Sources</h3> 

Dietary sources of phos&shy;phate include both organic and 
inor&shy;ganic phos&shy;phate. 
Phos&shy;phate is present in most food sources and is 
usually highest in animal 
protein compared to plant protein sources. 
Import&shy;antly, the bio&shy;avail&shy;ability 
of phos&shy;phorus differs between 
protein derived from animal sources compared to 
plant derived protein. In addition 
to con&shy;tain&shy;ing protein, plants store phos&shy;phate 
as phytate (Figure&nbsp;23b.1). 
Phos&shy;phate  is stored as phytate in unrefined cereals, 
oil seeds, and legumes that requires 
enzym&shy;atic or physical action to release 
phos&shy;phate bound to phytate. 
Bioavailability of phytate-phos&shy;phorus is low unless 
foods are processed using home-based methods 
such as soaking, germin&shy;ation, or 
ferment&shy;ation, or com&shy;mercial 
methods such as canning and extrusion (Tefarra, 
2021), all of which having the potential 
to improve phos&shy;phate avail&shy;ability from 
phytate. While these methods of proces&shy;sing 
improve phos&shy;phate avail&shy;ability from 
phytate, commercial processing leading to proces&shy;sed 
and ultra-processed foods 
may involve the addition of phos&shy;phate-containing 
additives that provide highly 
available sources of phos&shy;phate, such as 
sodium phos&shy;phate salts 
shown in Figure&nbsp;23b-1 (Calvo & Uribarri, 2021).  
<p></p>
Examples of animal, plant, and additive sources of phos&shy;phate are shown in 
Table&nbsp;23b.3, with the foods clas&shy;sified 
according to the NOVA system (Monteiro et al., 2017), 
which reflects their degree of processing. The NOVA system classifies 
foods into four groups, with the fourth group 
called &ldquo;ultra-processed&rdquo;. A recent 
cross-sect&shy;ional study of the United States food supply found that 71% of 
packaged foods and beverages were ultra-proces&shy;sed and 60% of 
energy intake came from ultra-proces&shy;sed foods, 
an increase over past decades (Baldridge et al. 2019). 
<p></p>
High ultra-processed food consumption patterns are associated with increased 
risk of  cardio&shy;vascular disease and 
mortality (Juul et al. 2021), chronic kidney 
disease (Cai et al. 2022), and various other serious chronic diseases. 
Specifically, ultra-proces&shy;sed foods 
such as cured meats containing added 
inorganic phos&shy;phates are associated with 
carotid intimal thick&shy;ening (Itkonen et al. 2014), 
decreased renal function (Duong et al. 2022), and low HDL cholesterol 
(Fulgoni et al. 2022). Causality between phos&shy;phate additive use in 
ultra-proces&shy;sed foods and 
increased risk of chronic disease or mortality remains 
to be established. However, there is growing aware&shy;ness 
that the use of phos&shy;phate 
additives in food processing increases the 
total phos&shy;phate availability and 
content of foods.

As can be seen in 
<a href="#table23b.3">Table&nbsp;23b.3</a>, it is difficult to describe 
dietary sources of phos&shy;phate as high or low 
without information on the source 
and form of phos&shy;phate, and their relative 
bio&shy;avail&shy;ability. In general, both 
plant and animal protein sources are 
good sources as noted earlier. In addition, 
the phytate-phos&shy;phorus present 
mainly in unre&shy;fined cereals, oil seeds, and 
legumes may become bio&shy;avail&shy;able, 
if  during proces&shy;sing phytate has been 
hydro&shy;lyzed, and phos&shy;phate bound to 
phytate released prior to absorp&shy;tion. Under 
the Nova classification, raw and minimally processed 
phytate rich plant foods 
have lower phos&shy;phorus bioavailability 
than compar&shy;ably proces&shy;sed animal protein 
sources (Calvo and Uribarri, 2021).
<p></p>  
The presence of phos&shy;phate additives in 
minimally and ultra&shy;proces&shy;sed foods (shown 
in Table 23b.3 by *) may or may not 
show differences in total phos&shy;phate content 
compared to unpro&shy;cessed foods if the 
content estimates are based on national 
nutrient content data base inform&shy;ation 
(Calvo, Moshfegh & Tucker, 2014). There is 
a lack of accounting for the 
phos&shy;phorus contrib&shy;ution by phos&shy;phate additives in 
most foods in the nutrient content data bases 
resulting in a widely recog&shy;nized 
under&shy;estim&shy;ation of phos&shy;phorus 
intake (Calvo, Sherman, Uribarri, 2019). 
Regret&shy;tably, many inves&shy;tigators 
have only recently discovered the need to 
directly analyze the phos&shy;phate content of the 
foods fed in studies to accurately 
design clinical trials examining 
dietary phos&shy;phate meta&shy;bolism (Stremke et al. 2018).
<p></p>
The phos&shy;phorus content of packaged foods 
in the US and Canada does not require 
phos&shy;phorus content to be listed on the label; 
however, if phos&shy;phate additives 
were added, then their use must be identified 
but not quant&shy;ified in the label 
ingred&shy;ients list (Calvo, Sherman, Uribarri, 2019). 
The US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) requires that 
all ingred&shy;ients (additives) added to food 
during processing must have prior 
approval for use in one of the 32&nbsp;specific 
technical functions recognized by the FDA. 
Phos&shy;phate containing additives and 
processed protein ingred&shy;ients 
(isolates and hydroy&shy;sates) are approved for at 
least 26&nbsp;of&nbsp;these technical func&shy;tions. 
Processed foods often contain one or more 
phos&shy;phate additives (Sullivan et al. 2007), 
because the more frequ&shy;ently used 
additives are approved for more than one tech&shy;nical function. 
For example, of the 
more than 60&nbsp;frequ&shy;ently used phos&shy;phate addi&shy;tives more than 
30&nbsp;are approved for 
use as a nutrient supplement, 24&nbsp;for use as 
a stabil&shy;izer or thick&shy;ener, 20&nbsp;as 
emuls&shy;ifiers and emuls&shy;ifier salts and 18&nbsp;as 
pH control agents. Under&shy;standing the 
role of dietary phos&shy;phate intake in 
chronic disease risk requires better 
under&shy;standing of the role of phos&shy;phate additives 
in food proces&shy;sing as phos&shy;phate 
additives can be added to foods for multiple functions, 
each contributing to 
higher phos&shy;phate content which is not 
always captured by the basic tools used by 
nutrit&shy;ional scien&shy;tists to determine total 
phos&shy;phate intake. A simple solution to 
this inaccuracy in the nutrient content 
data bases is to require phos&shy;phorus 
content on the Nutrient Facts Label (Calvo, Sherman, Uribarri, 2019).

<h3 id="23b.8">23b.8 Abnormalities in Serum phos&shy;phate</h3> 

Phos&shy;phate balance, a proxy for 
assessing phos&shy;phate nutritional status, is best 
assessed by measur&shy;ing fasting serum phos&shy;phate concent&shy;rations.
Nevertheless, single fasting serum phos&shy;phate measures do not always 
reflect the body phos&shy;phate stores 
because acute shifts of phos&shy;phate between body 
compart&shy;ments may tempor&shy;arily 
affect serum phos&shy;phate without affecting total body 
phos&shy;phorus content. Clinically, patients  
may present with either hypo&shy;phos&shy;phat&shy;emia 
(serum phos&shy;phate &lt;&nbsp;0.87mmol/L), or 
hyperphos&shy;phatemia (serum phos&shy;phate &gt;&nbsp;1.45mmol/L), 
with each one of these two 
condit&shy;ions char&shy;acter&shy;ized 
by dif&shy;ferent manifest&shy;ations and causes that cannot 
always be attributed to issues with intakes of dietary phos&shy;phate. 
The differ&shy;ences in clinical 
manifest&shy;ations and causes for hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia and 
hyper&shy;phos&shy;phatemia are summarized in 
Tables&nbsp;23b.4 and&nbsp;23b.5 (Koumakis et al. 2021).

Clinical manifestations of hypo&shy;phos&shy;phat&shy;emia 
include muscle weakness, 
cardio&shy;my&shy;opathy, respir&shy;atory insuf&shy;ficiency, 
osteo&shy;malacia, rickets, blood 
disorders, nervous system dysfunc&shy;tion, 
hyper&shy;cal&shy;ciuria and impaired insulin 
secretion. Acute hyper&shy;phos&shy;phatemia 
is associated with hypo&shy;calcemia, meta&shy;static 
cal&shy;cific&shy;ation, the gradual progres&shy;sion 
of renal failure, and secondary 
hyper&shy;para&shy;thyroid&shy;ism (Uribarri & Calvo, 2023). 
<p></p>
Trans&shy;cellular phos&shy;phate shifts such as 
those occurring with acute alkalosis can 
produce significant  hypophos&shy;phatemia by 
the intra&shy;cellular shift of phos&shy;phate, 
even though the total body phos&shy;phate content is 
unaffected. These shifts are 
usually transient in nature; however, 
when hyper&shy;phos&shy;phatemia or hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia 
are chronic, there is usually a correlation 
between serum phos&shy;phate levels and 
total body phos&shy;phate.  Moreover, 
there is a signif&shy;icant circadian variation in 
serum phos&shy;phate con&shy;cent&shy;ration, 
as well as gender and age differences in serum 
phos&shy;phate unrelated to phos&shy;phate intake 
effect on balance.  Given these problems 
with signif&shy;icant variation in serum 
concent&shy;ration, the European Food Safety 
Authority (EFSA, 2015) as well as other countries 
did not consider serum 
phos&shy;phate concent&shy;ration to be an 
appro&shy;priate biomarker for establishing dietary 
phos&shy;phate require&shy;ments or nutritional status. 
In contrast, the Institute of 
Medicine of North America adopted the measurement of 
serum inorganic phos&shy;phate 
as an acceptable and easy to monitor 
indictor for determining phos&shy;phate 
requirements for adults in the U.S. and Canada (IOM, 1997).

<h3 id="23b.9">23b.9.  Disease Risk Linked to Excess Dietary phos&shy;phate</h3>

High intakes of phos&shy;phate that exceed the dietary 
requirements or upper tolerable level, 
often in the absence of hyper&shy;phos&shy;phat&shy;emia, 
have been associated with risk of diseases such 
as cardio&shy;vas&shy;cular disease, and higher mortality in the general 
population (Uribarri & Calvo, 2013; Chang et al., 2014). 
An imbalance in the ratio of dietary calcium 
to phos&shy;phate intake arising from a low calcium intake in the presence of 
diets containing phos&shy;phate-con&shy;tain&shy;ing additives in 
ultra-proces&shy;sed foods, has been assoc&shy;iated 
with elevated concent&shy;rations of para&shy;thy&shy;roid hormone (secondary 
hyper&shy;para&shy;thyroid&shy;ism) (Kemi et al. 2009). Sustained secondary 
hyper&shy;para&shy;thyroid&shy;ism can adversely impact bone formation, 
increasing the risk of bone fragility in advanced age. High phos&shy;phate 
diets also impair kidney function over time and have been shown to increase the 
progression to end-stage renal disease (i.e., complete kidney failure) 
(Zoccali et al., 2011). More recently, risk of cancer, 
notably pros&shy;tate cancer in men, was found to be assoc&shy;iated with high 
dietary phos&shy;phate (Lv et al., 2022), 
while studies in rodent models have reported strong evidence for risk of other 
types of cancer (Arnst & Beck, 2021). 
<p></p>
A less studied disease risk of excess phos&shy;phate intakes in the general 
population that has been associated with 
hyper&shy;phos&shy;phatemia (serum phos&shy;phate &ge;&nbsp;1.0, 
42mmol/L) is anemia, as defined by 
low hemo&shy;globin con&shy;cent&shy;rations. This finding 
was first revealed in U.S&nbsp;NHANES 2005&ndash;2010 surveys, 
and later linked to 
inflam&shy;mation (Wojcicki, 2013; Czaya et al., 2022). 
Other disease or health risks 
linked to high phos&shy;phate diets include 
acceler&shy;ated aging (Kuro, 2021) and kidney 
stones (Khan et al. 2018). All these adverse health risks assoc&shy;iated with 
excessive phos&shy;phate intakes high&shy;light 
the urgent need for further research 
exploring how current dietary phos&shy;phate intakes 
may impact health and longevity. 

<h3 id="23b.10">23b.10 Inherited and Tumor-induced Disorders
of phos&shy;phate Metabolism </h3>

Genetic-related disorders of phos&shy;phate meta&shy;bolism , notably chronic 
hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia, are very rare in 
most populations, Moreover, they are 
unrelated to dietary phos&shy;phate intakes, 
unlike the disorders associated with 
excessive phos&shy;phate intakes. 
These genetic phos&shy;phate disorders include X-Linked 
Hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemic Rickets (XLH); 
Auto&shy;somal-dom&shy;inant Hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemic Rickets 
(ADHR); Auto&shy;somal Reces&shy;sive 
Hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemic Rickets (ARHR), and Hereditary 
Hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemic Rickets with Hyper&shy;calciuria (HHRH). 
They are inherited diseases 
or result from missense muta&shy;tions 
which all impact FGF&#8209;23 metabolism, by either 
increasing circu&shy;lating levels of the 
hormone or its activity, which ultimately 
lead to hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia 
arising from phos&shy;phate wasting (i.e., excessive urinary 
phos&shy;phate excretion in relation to serum phos&shy;phate level). 
Sustained hypo&shy;phos&shy;phatemia can mani&shy;fest as rickets in children 
and osteo&shy;malacia in adults 
but can be treated with oral phos&shy;phate sup&shy;plement&shy;ation, 
and more recently with 
biologics that block FGF&#8209;23 renal hormone action 
(Athonvarangkul & Insogna, 2021).
<p></p>
Tumor-induced osteo&shy;malacia (also known as oncogenic 
osteo&shy;malacia) is also a 
disorder of phos&shy;phate wasting, 
but it is not inherited, instead stemming from 
excessive levels of FGF&#8209;23 secreted by tumors.  
Such excessive levels of FGF&#8209;23 
again promote renal phos&shy;phate wasting 
resulting in under-mineral&shy;ized bone 
(osteo&shy;malacia), bone pain, fractures, and 
muscle weakness in adults (Brandi et al. 2021).
