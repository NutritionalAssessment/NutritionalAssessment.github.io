Figure 24c.7   Relationship between the estimated prevalence
of inadequate zinc intake and the prevalence of childhood stunting.
Stunting data (low height-for-age) are for children less than
five years of age in138 low- and middle-income countries.
The solid line represents the line of identity (intercept = 0,
slope = 1). The dashed line represents the best-fit regression line.
Dotted lines demarcate countries with 
a high risk of inadequate zinc intake and where 
the prevalence of stunting is > 20%
