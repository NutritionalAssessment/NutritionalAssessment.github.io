<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Multiple physiological functions are affected by zinc deficiency because 
of the involvement of zinc in numerous metabolic processes
as a catalytic, structural, and regulatory ion.  As a consequence, in zinc deficiency 
numerous nonspecific changes occur, including impairments in growth, 
immune function, appetite, taste acuity, and possibly neurobehavioural 
function.  Zinc homeostasis in the body is tightly controlled over a wide 
range of zinc intakes, primarily by adjusting losses of endogenous 
fecal zinc. Such strict homeostatic control leads to difficulties 
in the assessment of  zinc insufficiency and excess.  
The BOND Expert Zinc Panel recommended three indicators 
to identify populations at elevated risk of zinc 
deficiency &mdash; the prevalence of usual zinc intakes 
below the estimated average requirement, the percentage 
with low plasma / serum zinc concentrations, and the percentage of 
children aged &lt;&nbsp;5 years who are stunted (i.e., HAZ &lt;&nbsp;&ndash;2SD).   
Reference limits for plasma / serum zinc  (depending on age, sex, 
time of day, fasting status) are available to identify populations at 
risk of zinc deficiency, provided the correct protocols are 
followed for the collection, separation, and analysis  of plasma zinc.  
Moreover, in view of the poor specificity of impaired linear growth, 
assessment of this functional indicator should be made in combination 
with at least one of the other indicators.  Assessment of marginal zinc 
deficiency in individuals is more difficult because of the absence 
of frank clinical signs and the lack of a reliable sensitive and specific biomarker. 
The recommended approach combines a medical history, 
qualitative dietary and clinical assessment, with plasma / serum zinc 
providing supplementary data. 
The BOND Expert Zinc Panel classified other potential zinc biomarkers 
into three groups: 
(1) potentially useful (hair zinc, urinary zinc, and neurobehavioral function); 
(2) emerging biomarkers (nail zinc, zinc-dependent proteins, 
oxidative stress and DNA integrity; zinc kinetics, taste acuity), and 
(3) not useful (zinc-dependent enzymes, erythrocyte and leukocyte zinc); 
strengths and weaknesses of each are discussed.

        In an adult 70kg male there is approximately 1.5&ndash;2.5g of zinc, of
        which over 80% is found in the skeletal muscle and bone. Much smaller
        amounts are present in the liver, gastrointestinal tract, skin, kidney,
        lung, prostate, and other organs, as shown in 		    
	(<a href="#table24c1">Table&nbsp;24c.1</a>).

  style="width:480px;height:710px;"></iframe>
    <p>
        Unlike other trace elements such as iron and copper, or minerals such
        as calcium, there are no large, sequestered, readily mobilizable stores of zinc that
        can be rapidly released in response to variations in
        dietary intakes of zinc. Instead, there is a small pool of rapidly
        exchangeable zinc which is located in bone, liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen
        and plasma and accounts for about 10% of whole-body zinc

	 This pool turns over completely about five times each day to provide zinc
        for zinc-dependent metabolic functions throughout the body. It is the
        loss of a critical but small amount of zinc from this pool that leads
        to the biochemical and clinical signs of zinc deficiency

		Bone may also
        provide a passive reserve of zinc, especially during growth, so that

	 More than 300 metalloenzymes require zinc as a catalyst for function or
        regulation. During zinc deficiency, their activity is decreased,
        although their structure does not change, and with the addition
        of zinc, enzyme activity is restored. Zinc metalloenzymes are involved
        in nucleic acid metabolism and cellular proliferation, differentiation,
        and growth; examples are listed in

        Zinc also plays an essential structural role in the folding of some
        proteins and a lack of zinc results in protein misfolding and the loss of
        function. A finger-like structure, known as a zinc finger motif,
        stabilizes the structure of a variety of proteins, including those
        involved in cellular differentiation or proliferation, signal
        transduction, cellular adhesion, or transcription. Zinc fingers use
        cysteine and histidine to form a tetrahedral Zn<sup>2+</sup>
        coordination complex. The extent to which the intake of dietary zinc
        affects the function of zinc finger proteins is unclear. Zinc also
        maintains the structure of certain enzymes, notably the antioxidant
        enzyme, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase  (Cu,Zn&#8209;SOD)

        Over 3% of all identified human genes contain zinc finger proteins
        that regulate gene expression by acting as transcription factors. Gene
        expression may also regulate the effects of zinc deficiency on lipid
        peroxidation, immune function, apoptosis, and neuronal function

        Zinc is also involved in cell signaling through the
        metal response element-binding transcription factor&nbsp;1 (MTF1).
        Whether MTF1 regulates genes negatively or positively appears to depend
        on the cellular zinc status. Zinc may also have a direct regulatory
        role controlling numerous cell-signaling pathways by modulating kinase
        and phosphorylase activities.  For more details of the metabolic
        functions of zinc at the cellular level, see King and Cousins

        Zinc-dependent cellular functions are coordinated by one or more
        of twenty four zinc transporters. Two classes of zinc transporters exist:
        ZIP proteins and ZnT proteins. It is the up-  or
        down-regulation of these transporter genes in response to zinc intake
        that helps to maintain cellular zinc homeostasis. The ZnT proteins
        (n=10) generally transport zinc ions out of the cytosol, whereas ZIP
        (SLC 39) proteins (n=14) import the ions from the cellular compartments or
        the extracellular space into the cytosol. Individual ZIP and ZnT transporters 
	are located in specific cell
        types. For example, ZIP&#8209;14 appears to be involved in the uptake of zinc
        by the liver in response to acute inflammation and infection, whereas
        ZnT3 is found in the synaptic vesicles of some types of neurons, and
        ZnT8 in the secretory granules of &beta;&#8209;pancreatic cells

        <h3 id="24c.1.2">24c.1.2  Physiological functions of zinc </h3>
   
        Multiple physiological functions are affected by zinc deficiency due to
        the ubiquitous involvement of zinc in cellular metabolism. A modest
        deprivation in zinc intake over the long-term results in detectable
        changes in growth, immune function, and possibly neurobehavioural
        function. Other signs of marginal zinc deficiency  include poor
        appetite and impaired taste acuity (hypogeusia).
    <p>
        Impaired growth in zinc deficiency arises from the role of zinc in DNA
        transcription and gene expression, signal transduction pathways, and
        endocrine function (e.g., insulin-like growth factor); these effects
        are summarized in  
	<a href="#figure24c1A">Figure&nbsp;24c.1</a>.
        <iframe src="figures/fig24c-1.htm" name="figure24c1AFrame" id="figure24c1A" style="width:465px;height:390px"></iframe>
	 Of the growth indices, height&#8209; or
        length-for&#8209;age is considered the best functional bioindicator
        associated with the risk of zinc deficiency in populations.   Increased linear growth 
        is the primary response to increased zinc intake, with an associated gain in weight.

        Zinc is also required for the synthesis and functions of immune
        regulatory proteins and for the maintenance of normal immune function.
        Consequently, zinc deficiency causes immune dysfunction. Both barrier function 
	and cellular components of the innate immune responses (i.e., macrophage
	and neutrophil function) are compromised as well as the
	acquired immune system, with the largest effect being on reducing CD4 T cell
	function

        deficiency promotes systemic inflammation, characterized by

        The mechanism whereby zinc influences neurobehavioral functioning is
        not well established. In the central nervous system, zinc is
        concentrated in the presynaptic vesicles of zinc-containing neurons,
        which are found primarily in the forebrain and connect with other
        cerebral cortices and limbic structures. During synaptic events, zinc
        is released and passes into postsynaptic neurons, serving as 
        neurotransmitters.  Zinc deficiency may interfere with these processes
        and thus compromise neurobehavioral functioning, especially during 
        times of rapid growth and development, such as infancy, when demands for
        zinc are high

   <h3 id="24c.1.3">24c.1.3   Absorption and metabolism of zinc </h3>
 
        Zinc is mainly absorbed in the upper part of the small intestine by two
        mechanisms: a saturable, carrier-mediated process and, secondly, by a non-mediated, or
        passive process. Two families of zinc transporters control the
        transport of zinc on the enterocyte membrane and account for the
        saturable component. Once zinc is absorbed into the enterocyte,
        movement of zinc within the cell is influenced by metallothionein and
        the transporter ZnT7. Export of zinc from the intestinal epithelial
        cells into the portal vein is controlled by the ZnT1 transporter. About
        30%&ndash;40% of the zinc in portal blood is exchanged with the liver,  the
        main organ involved in zinc metabolism. From the liver, zinc is
        released into the systemic circulation for delivery to peripheral
         tissues bound mainly to albumin  and &alpha;2&#x2011;macroglobulin

        Zinc homeostasis in the body is tightly controlled over a wide range of
        zinc intakes. This is achieved primarily by adjusting zinc excretion
        through the gastrointestinal tract. Losses of zinc via the
        gastrointestinal tract comprise both unabsorbed dietary zinc and
        endogenous fecal zinc.  The sources of endogenous fecal zinc are
        uncertain but probably include secretions from pancreatic and
        intestinal mucosal cells.  When zinc intakes are very low, there is a
        decrease in zinc secretion into the intestinal lumen, and endogenous
        fecal zinc declines. With increasing zinc intakes, endogenous
        fecal zinc losses increase to maintain homeostasis. If the adult zinc intake
        is extremely low (e.g., &lt;&nbsp;2mg/day), then the reductions
        in losses of endogenous fecal zinc may be insufficient to re-establish
        zinc homeostasis. In these circumstances, additional metabolic
        adjustments occur to mobilize zinc from the small, exchangeable pool
        located in liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, and possibly bone, to
        maintain zinc-dependent functions

        Unlike iron, absorption of zinc does not change in response to
        alterations in whole-body zinc homeostasis or status. Instead, zinc
        absorption is influenced by current zinc intake, not the past
        or long-term zinc intakes, or status

        Absorption of zinc can be measured / defined in two ways: (1) the fraction (or
        percent) of zinc ingested that is absorbed (Fractional Zinc Absorption
        or FZA), determined by the dividing the amount absorbed by the amount
        digested, and (2) the total quantity of absorbed zinc (TAZ) over the
        whole day.  The fraction of zinc absorbed depends on the
        bioavailability of the ingested zinc, whereas the total quantity
        absorbed is dependent mainly on the amount of zinc consumed and the
        bioavailability of the zinc in the diet. Intake of dietary zinc affects
        fractional zinc absorption and the total quantity of absorbed zinc
        differently. With increasing zinc intakes, the total amount of absorbed
        zinc increases while the percent absorbed declines

        These adjustments in the efficiency of zinc absorption with

        In addition to the amount of the dietary zinc intake,
        the food sources of zinc may also affect zinc absorption.  The dietary
        factor with the greatest effect on zinc absorption is phytic acid
        (myoinositol hexakisphosphoric acid (InsP6) and its associated
        magnesium, potassium, and calcium salts &mdash; termed phytates. Phytic acid
        and its salts are found in high concentrations in unrefined cereals,
        legumes, nuts and oil seeds. Phytate binds zinc in the intestinal lumen
        and forms an insoluble complex that cannot be digested or absorbed by
        humans because of the absence of the intestinal enzyme phytase

        There is no functional reserve or body store of zinc, as noted earlier, so an adequate
        regular supply of readily absorbable zinc is required.
        Hence, individuals consuming a usual diet low in zinc and/or with poor zinc 
	 bioavailability may be nutritionally zinc deficient. Food sources of readily
        absorbable zinc include organ meats, red meat, poultry, fish, and
        shellfish; oysters are one of the richest food sources of absorbable
        zinc. In general, the amount of zinc is higher in dark red meat than in
        white meat. Starchy roots, tubers, fruits, and vegetables have a low
        zinc content. Zinc is less readily available in whole grain cereals,
        nuts and legumes: their zinc content varies, depending on the
        zinc content of the soil or fertilizer treatment, growing location, and
        processing methods (e.g., milling of cereals). Loss of zinc from most
        foods during cooking is minimal.
     <p>
        Several dietary components have been investigated as potential
        modifiers of zinc bioavailability. A systematic review, however,
        concluded that for many of these potential modifiers, data were
        insufficient to accurately determine their impact on zinc absorption

	A notable exception is phytic acid

        magnesium, potassium, and calcium salts &mdash; termed "phytates"  &mdash; 
	potent inhibitors of zinc absorption, as noted earlier. 
	In general, phytic acid and its
        salts are found in high concentrations in unrefined cereals, legumes,
        nuts and oil seeds. Concentations vary widely depending on the
        botanical variety, environmental or climatic growing conditions, the use of
        phosphate fertilizers, and the stage of maturation. The highest levels are
        reached at seed maturity.  During some food-processing, preparation and
        cooking practices, such as milling / pounding, soaking,
        germination / malting, mixtamalization, or fermentation, phytate is
        dephosphorylated to the lower myo-inositol phosphate forms (IP1 to

	Assessment of dietary zinc intakes is the best method for 
	estimating zinc exposure in individuals and populations. 
	To determine  dietary zinc intakes, a quantitative dietary method 
	such as a weighed or estimated food record or a validated 24-h 
	recall must be used.  Details of the procedures to estimate 
	dietary zinc intakes using a modified 24-hr recall specifically 
	for use in lower income countries are available in a Dietary 
	Technical Monograph (#8)

	<p>
	Information on dietary zinc intakes can be used for several purposes. 
	At the population level, data can be used to: estimate the prevalence of inadequate zinc intakes, classify subpopulations at elevated risk, 
	design and monitor zinc intervention programs, and 
	identify dietary patterns that contribute to inadequate zinc intakes. 
	At the individual level, those at risk of inadequate intakes can be 
	identified for dietary counseling. Tools have been developed to 
	facilitate the collection of dietary zinc intakes and analyze the 
	data to assess dietary adequacy

	<p>
	Inadequate intakes of dietary zinc can arise from low 
	intakes of zinc <i>per se,</i> poor bioavailability, or a combination 
	of these dietary factors, as noted earlier. In low income countries, 
	where unrefined cereals and legumes
	containing high levels of phytate	are often the 
	major source of energy and zinc, inadequate intakes of 
	bioavailable forms of zinc are the most likely cause of zinc deficiency. 
	Other diets based on starchy roots or tubers have a low 
	total zinc and phytate content. Values for the phytate content of raw 
	and processed plant-based staples are available in
	the FAO / INFOODS / IZiNCG Global Food Composition Database

	When collecting dietary intake data for zinc, intakes of dietary 
	phytate should also be determined, whenever possible.  
       <p>
	Data on both zinc and phytate intakes permit the calculation 
	of phytate-to-zinc molar ratios from which an estimate of the 
	bioavailability of zinc can be obtained, as noted in Section 24c.1.5

	The recommended dietary indicator to identify a population or

	Because information on usual zinc intakes is required, 
	food intakes must be measured on two non-consecutive days or three 
	consecutive days. It is preferable that multiple days of intake 
	data are collected for all individuals in the population. 
	However, if this is not possible, then at least two non-consecutive 
	days of dietary intake data from a sub-sample (40&ndash;50) 
	of individuals per stratum should be collected.  
	These data permit an estimate of the day-to-day variation in zinc 
	intake within one individual (i.e., within-person variation) 
	to be estimated, allowing a distribution of usual zinc intakes 
	for the population group to be generated using specialized 
	software. Finally, the  Estimated Average 

	Requirements (EARs) for zinc,  specific for age, sex, 
	physiological status, and in some cases the  
	phytate-to-zinc molar ratio of the diet, are needed to calculate 
	the prevalence of inadequate intakes. If quantitative data 
	on phytate intakes are not available, 
	then the phytate-to-zinc molar ratio can be estimated based on the diet type.

	The example also shows that in this particular 
	case, adjusting the distribution significantly reduces the 
	proportion of individuals considered to have intakes below the EAR. 
	An elevated risk of zinc deficiency in the population is said to exist 
	when 25% or more of the population have zinc intakes less than the EAR.

	methods used, as described in 	Gibson et al.

	and said to cover the average phytate intakes in European 
	populations: (300mg/d; 600mg/d; 900mg/d; 1200mg/d).
	In view of the uncertainty about whether recommendations for

	The prevalence of usual zinc intakes below the EAR is simply

	An elevated risk of zinc deficiency in the population is 
	said to exist when 25% or more of the population have 
	zinc intakes less than the EAR. However, to assist with

	Fasting serum zinc concentrations are homeostatically controlled within fairly narrow

	 Of interest is the finding that serum

        Serum or plasma zinc has been used to assess the risk of zinc
        deficiency in several national surveys. The population is considered to
        have an elevated risk of zinc deficiency of public health importance
        when a particular population has more than 20% of individuals with a
        serum zinc concentration below the age and sex-specific cutoffs. In a

        For an individual, serum zinc concentrations are not a reliable
        indicator of zinc status due to both the strong homeostatic control
        mechanisms and the many factors other than zinc intake that can
        independently influence serum zinc concentrations (see below).
         This means that serum zinc concentrations may be within the normal
        range despite the presence of mild zinc deficiency generating growth
        retardation, loss of appetite, or impaired immune function. Currently
        for individuals the recommended approach combines a thorough medical
        history of risk factors for zinc deficiency, a qualitative dietary
        assessment to identify an inadequate dietary intake, and a clinical
        assessment, with plasma or serum zinc providing only supplementary data

        <strong>Fasting status </strong>
        also markedly affects serum zinc concentrations. During a usual
        overnight fast of &ge;&nbsp;8h, serum zinc levels increase,
        generally reaching a peak just before breakfast. Fluctuations in serum
        zinc also occur throughout the day, mainly in response to the
        consumption of meals. Serum zinc levels decline progressively for
        several hours after each meal, before rising prior to the next meal

        any transfer of zinc from the cells to the serum or plasma.
        Alternatively, if centrifugation on site is not feasible, then the
        blood should be placed in a cool box or refrigerator immediately after
        collection where it can be held at 2&ndash;10&deg;C for up to 24&nbsp;hours
        prior to being centrifuged and the serum or plasma separated.  After
        separation, the serum or plasma should be transferred to a

        serum reduces the viscosity of the sample, which minimizes both the
        matrix effect on the rate of aspiration and the tendency for the flame
        atomic absorption burner-head to become blocked. 
	This may be especially a problem with
        plasma because of precipitates that form in these samples. Sometimes
        the serum or plasma samples are ashed at low temperatures prior to
        analysis by flame AAS. For very small samples, flameless AAS can be
        used.  Increasingly, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission
        spectrometry or ICP mass spectrometry are being used.. For all methods,
        in&#8209;house quality controls and standard reference materials (SRMs) such
        as bovine serum (SRM 1598) from the National Institute of Standards and
        Technology should be used. A coefficient of variation of &lt;&nbsp;5% is attainable 
	 for zinc using flame AAS. Use of a trichloroacetic
        acid deproteinization technique is not recommended.

		Serum or plasma samples for zinc analyses can be
        refrigerated (4&deg;C) for 2&ndash;3 weeks prior to analysis. For longer
        storage periods, samples should be frozen at &ndash;25&deg;C or below.
        To prevent dehydration during long-term storage, especially if

        <h3 id="24c.4.2">24c.4.2  Measurement of height or length </h3>            
		
	For infants and children &le; 85cm (i.e. &le; 2&nbsp;years of age), recumbent length
        is  the recommended measure, preferably with the use of an infantometer with a
        range of 30&ndash;110cm, equipped with a digital counter reader.  Recumbent
        length should be recorded to the nearest millimeter, or even more
        precisely (i.e., 0.1mm) when possible.  Wooden or acrylic length
        measuring boards can be used, but they are rarely fitted with digital
        counters so are less reliable.  Note that recumbent length for a child
        of about 2y is about 5mm greater than standing height for the same child
	<span data-tippy-content="Haschke, F, and M A van't Hof. (2000) “Euro-Growth references 
	for length, weight, and body circumferences.

     target="right" >Haschke and van&rsquo;t Hof, 2000</a>).</span>
        <p>
        Children &gt;&nbsp;85cm and adults should be measured in the standing
        position, preferably using a free-standing stadiometer (range 65&ndash;206cm), again equipped with a digital counter reader capable of measuring
        stature to 0.1mm.  Platform scales with movable measuring rods should
        not be used as they are less accurate.
        Clothing should be minimal when height measurements are taken so that
        posture can be clearly seen. Shoes and socks should not be worn. The
        timing of the measurement should be recorded; diurnal variations in
        height occur due to compression of the spine as the day progresses
		
	<span data-tippy-content="Buckler, JM. (1978) Variations in height throughout the day. 
	Archives of disease in childhood vol. 53,9 762 ">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/568918"
     target="right" >Buckler, 1978</a>). </span>

	 Consequently, in population studies, standing height should always be measured at the
        same time of day, preferably in the afternoon.
        <p>
        When measuring recumbent length or standing height, attempts should be
        made to minimize measurement errors. In longitudinal studies involving
        sequential measurements on the same group of individuals, one person
        should conduct all of the measurements throughout the study to
        eliminate between-examiner errors. This is especially critical when
        growth velocity is estimated; growth increments are generally small and
        are associated with two error terms, one for each measurement occasion.
        Recommendations of the minimal intervals necessary to provide reliable
        data on growth increments during infancy and early childhood are available

	In the WHO
        MGRS, the minimal interval
        recommended for reliable data on length measurements was every two
        weeks for infants from 2&ndash;6 weeks of age, monthly for ages 2&ndash;12 months,
        and bimonthly in the second year. During
        adolescence, increments measured over 6 months are the minimum interval
        recommended

        For shorter intervals, the combined errors
        may be too large in relation to the expected mean increment.
        <p>
        In large regional surveys, several well-trained anthropometrists are
        often needed to rotate among the participants to reduce the effect of
        measurement bias. Regular standardization sessions to assess both
        within&#8209; and between-examiner reliability should be conducted throughout
        the data collection period to maintain the quality of the measurements
        and to identify and correct systematic errors in the measurements;

        They emphasize, however, that the need to collect a 24&#8209;hour urine
        sample and the lack of established cutoffs limit the usefulness of
        urinary zinc as a biomarker. Moreover, because urinary zinc only
        responds to very low dietary zinc intakes, its use as a biomarker of
        dietary zinc intake among free-living populations is limited.
    
    <h3 id="24c.5.1">24c.5.1   Measurement of urinary zinc excretion</h3>

        The amounts of zinc excreted in the urine usually range from 300 to 600&micro;g/d. A 24-h urine collection is preferred because diurnal variation in
        urinary zinc excretion may be significant. Measurements of urinary zinc
        are usually performed by flame AAS.

	When the growing hair approaches the skin
        surface, the hair undergoes keratinization and the zinc accumulated
        during its formation becomes sealed into keratin protein structures
        and isolated from metabolic processes.   Hence, the zinc content of the
        hair shaft reflects the quantity of zinc available in the blood supply
        at the time of the hair growth, not at the time of sampling

        is unchanged or chronic zinc deficiency exists. Assuming a normal rate

        Hair specimens should be collected from a representative sample of the

        the year. Samples (at least 50mg) should be cut at skin level from the
        occipital region of the scalp (i.e., across the back of the head in a
        line between the top of the ears) with stainless steel scissors. Only
        the proximal (i.e., closest to the scalp) 1.0&ndash;2.0cm of the hair
        strands should be retained. These specimens will reflect the zinc

        Washing with nonionic detergents (e.g., Triton X&#8209;100) with or without
        acetone is preferred for hair as these detergents are less likely to
        leach bound zinc from the hair and yet are effective in removing
        superficial adsorbed zinc. Washing with chelating agents such as EDTA
        should be avoided because they remove some of the tightly bound zinc
        that is an integral part of the hair sample

        Several laboratory methods can be used to measure hair zinc
        concentrations in the washed specimens, depending on the instruments
        available. Washed specimens can be be prepared for analysis using
        microwave digestion when available, or wet or dry ashing, although
	the  use of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to solubilize hair at room
        temperature warrants investigation. The latter method eliminates 
	 time-consuming ashing or wet digestion. Traditional analytical methods
        include flame AAS or multi-element ICP&#8209;MS, although 
        non-destructive  instrumental neutron activation 
		analysis (INAA) can also be
        used. For INAA the washed hair specimens are placed in small, weighed
        trace-element-free polyethylene bags or tubes and oven-dried for 22&nbsp;hours 
        at 55&deg;C. After cooling in a desiccator, the packaged specimens
        are sealed and weighed, prior to irradiation in a nuclear reactor.

Expression of the metallothionein gene is induced by zinc through the binding 
of zinc to metal-binding-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF-1). 
This transcription factor is known to be sensitive to cellular zinc 
concentrations, with metallothionein synthesis increasing as cellular 
zinc increases. Reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

	Hence these findings indicate that metallothionein expression in 
	leukocytes is sensitive to changes in dietary zinc intake, 
	decreasing in zinc depletion, and increasing in response to zinc 
	supplementation in a dose-dependent manner. However, these 
	changes were not associated with consistent changes in plasma zinc, 
	which suggests that metallothionein expression in leukocytes may 
	be a more sensitive biomarker than plasma zinc for determining 
	zinc exposure. Of interest was the lack of sensitivity of

	The effect of potential 
	confounders (e.g., inflammatory agents, free radicals,

	In addition, more research is needed on whether the sensitivity to zinc 
	supplementation and depletion is affected by variations in the proportions 
	of blood cell subtypes among individuals. The abundance of metallothionein 
	transcript in monocytes is three times that of granulocytes,
	and twice that found in T lymphocytes

<h2 id="24c.11">24c.11 Oxidative stress and DNA integrity</h2>

	Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the 
	increased production of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
	(superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals) and the 
	decreased protective action of antioxidants that are responsible 
	for the neutralization and removal of ROS.  Oxidative stress arising 
	from this imbalance has the potential to damage proteins, 
	deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and lipids, and may serve as a 
	potential predictor in the development of different ROS-dependent 
	diseases (e.g.,vascular diseases). Zinc plays an important 
	role in antioxidant defence and the maintenance of cellular DNA integrity.  
	As zinc itself is redox inert, it does not function as an 
	antioxidant <i>per se,</i> instead functioning indirectly as an 
	antioxidant and as a "pro-oxidant" over 
	a limited range of zinc concentrations. Consequently, the term "pro-antioxidant" 
	is used to describe the indirect functions of zinc as an antioxidant. 
	In contrast, outside this range, zinc is a pro-oxidant. 
	Hence, an increase in cellular oxidative stress and 
	DNA damage may be an early sign of both reductions 
	in cellular zinc as well as zinc overload.

	Several human studies have investigated whether intracellular

	dietary zinc  for six weeks (i.e., 0.6mg Zn/d for one week 
	followed by 4mg Zn/d for five weeks), the number of

	<strong>Measurement of taste acuity</strong>
	<p>
	Several methods for testing 
	taste acuity are available. Usually, evaluation is based on assessment 
	of both the detection and recognition thresholds 
	for each of four taste qualities (e.g., sweet, salt, sour, bitter), 
	and sometimes umami (monosodium glutamate). The detection 
	threshold is defined as "the lowest concentration at which a taste 
	can just be detected"; the recognition threshold is "the 
	lowest concentration at which the quality of the taste 
	stimulus can be recognized". The two thresholds are each 
	determined for one taste quality before proceeding to the next. 
	Several investigators have used this technique on young 
	children

	Participants rinse a small amount (10mL) of each solution

	to identify the presented sample as salty or plain water. 
	Salt solutions of increasing or decreasing concentrations are 
	used, where appropriate, until the subjects correctly

	lower concentration. Only 2 out of 10 judgments are allowed

	although so far, this method has not been 
	applied in studies of zinc status. For all taste acuity methods, 
	it is preferable to perform the tests midmorning, at least 2 hours 
	after a meal, with the same person administering the test on each 
	occasion. Many other factors affect taste function. 
	Hence, taste acuity should be used in conjunction with 
	other biomarkers to assess zinc status.

        Although zinc serves in a catalytic role for over three hundred zinc
        metalloenzymes, no single zinc-dependent enzyme has gained widespread
        acceptance as a biomarker of zinc status in humans. Their response to
        zinc deficiency, even in experimental studies of zinc depletion &ndash; repletion, has

        The separation of leukocytes and other specific cell types is
        difficult, and some of the inconsistencies reported for leukocyte zinc
        in zinc depletion&ndash;repletion studies may result from analyzing mixtures
        of cell types (e.g., neutrophils and lymphocytes), with different
        half&ndash;lives and zinc concentrations.  Further, leukocytes and
        other specific cellular types are prone to contamination from exogenous
        sources of zinc and from platelets. Data are also difficult to
        interpret because no consensus exists for the method used to express
        zinc concentrations in leukocytes or specific cell types. Results can
        be expressed on a mg/kg dry weight basis to eliminate the effects of
        variable cell water content, but results expressed as ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells are
        generally preferred

		Additional
        factors limiting the use of leukocyte zinc or the zinc content of
        subpopulations is the relatively large volumes of blood (i.e., about 5

        criteria

        Concentrations of zinc in saliva have been investigated as a measure of
        zinc status because zinc appears to be a component of gustin, an
        essential protein involved in taste acuity, that may be impaired by
        marginal zinc deficiency

	As well, although the collection of saliva
        samples is quick and relatively noninvasive, the rate of flow and

		In view of these problems,
        and the contradictory results observed, the use of salivary zinc as a

        The efficient regulation of zinc homeostasis complicates the assessment
        of zinc deficiency and excess, and currently there is no single,

	 For each biomarker, an indicator has been developed to estimate risk of zinc
        deficiency at the population level. These are: (a) the prevalence of usual zinc intakes below the estimated average
        requirement (EAR), (b) the percentage of the population with low serum zinc
        concentrations below the appropriate reference limit, and (c) the percentage of
        children less than 5&nbsp;years of age with 
	 length- or height-for-age less
        than &ndash;2SD below the age-specific median of the reference population

	 For each indicator, a "trigger level" for the prevalence
        considered indicative of elevated risk and of public health concern is
        given, at which level an intervention to improve population zinc status
        is warranted.  Ideally, all three indicators should be included in a
        survey to strengthen the conclusion regarding the zinc status of the
        population and the need for an intervention, although in practice, this
        is not always possible.   <span data-tippy-content="de Benoist B, Darnton-Hill I, Davidsson L, Fontaine O,.

        according to the level of available resources:  (Box 24.7)

 	<div class="box">Box 24c.7.   
	
<ul><li>	<strong>	Limited resources available  </strong>   Review existing evidence:
Stunting rates (height&ndash; or length&ndash;for&ndash;age Z-score &lt; &ndash;2SD) of children under 5&nbsp;years of age;
Dietary patterns and likelihood of providing adequate bioavailable zinc in the food supply;
Results from clinical, community&ndash;based studies of functional response to zinc supplements;
Results from community&ndash;based studies on dietary zinc intakes or serum zinc concentration</li>

<li>	<strong>	Some resources available  </strong>   Augment existing information with data collected in a prospective survey. This would
normally be linked with other health/nutrition surveys with broader goals:
In at least a subsample of the survey population, or samples focused among subpopulations
that are likely beneficiaries of nutrition or health interventions.  Include
serum zinc concentration and/or dietary zinc intake adequacy as biomarkers;
where food&ndash;based interventions may be considered, at least 1&nbsp;day of 
24&#8209;hour recall
per individual in the sample should be completed</li>

<li>	<strong>	Adequate resources available  </strong>   Where resources permit:
Serum zinc concentration should be determined in a representative sample of all relevant
subpopulation groups;
24&#8209;hour dietary recalls, or other locally validated quantitative dietary assessment
methods, should be repeated on nonconsecutive days on at 
least a subsample to estimate the distribution of usual zinc intakes </li>

   <p>
        For individuals, unless zinc deficiency is severe, moderate or mild zinc deficiency can be present in the
        absence of abnormal zinc biomarkers, including serum zinc, despite
        the presence of disturbances such as growth retardation, loss of
        appetite, and impaired immune function. Hence, for assessing the zinc status of individuals, the
        recommended approach is based on a medical history, a qualitative
        assessment of the diet, and a clinical assessment, with plasma or serum
        zinc providing only supplementary data
