<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Multiple physio&shy;logical functions are affected by zinc defi&shy;ciency because
of the involve&shy;ment of zinc in numerous meta&shy;bolic processes
as a&nbsp;catalytic, structural, and regulatory ion.  As a&nbsp;consequence, in zinc defi&shy;ciency
numerous nonspecific changes occur, including impairments in growth,
immune function, appetite, taste acuity, and possibly neuro&shy;behavioural
function.  Zinc homeo&shy;stasis in the body is tightly controlled over a&nbsp;wide
range of zinc intakes, primarily by adjusting losses of endogenous
fecal zinc. Such strict homeo&shy;static control leads to difficulties
in the assessment of  zinc insufficiency and excess.
The BOND Expert Zinc Panel recommen&shy;ded three indicators
to identify popu&shy;lations at elevated risk of zinc
defi&shy;ciency &mdash; the prevalence of usual zinc intakes
below the estimated average require&shy;ment, the percentage
with low plasma / serum zinc concen&shy;trations, and the percentage of
children &lt;&nbsp;5y who are stunted 
<span class="n">(i.e., HAZ &lt;&nbsp;&ndash;2SD).</span>
Reference limits for plasma / serum zinc  (depending on age, sex,
time of day, fasting status) are available to identify popu&shy;lations at
risk of zinc defi&shy;ciency, provided the correct protocols are
followed for the collection, separation, and analysis  of plasma zinc.
Moreover, in view of the poor specificity of impaired linear growth,
assessment of this functional indicator should be made in com&shy;bination
with at least one of the other indicators.  Assessment of marginal zinc
defi&shy;ciency in individuals is more difficult because of the absence
of frank clinical signs and the lack of a&nbsp;reliable sensitive and specific biomarker.
The recom&shy;men&shy;ded approach com&shy;bines a&nbsp;medical history,
qualitative dietary and clinical assessment, with plasma / serum zinc
providing supple&shy;mentary data.
The BOND Expert Zinc Panel classified other potential zinc biomarkers
into three groups:
(1) potentially useful (hair zinc, urinary zinc, and neuro&shy;behavioral function);
(2) emerging biomarkers (nail zinc, zinc-dependent proteins,
oxidative stress and DNA integrity; zinc kinetics, taste acuity), and
(3) not useful (zinc-dependent enzymes, erythrocyte and leukocyte zinc);
strengths and weaknesses of each are discussed.

Unlike other trace elements such as iron and copper, or minerals such
as calcium, there are no large, sequestered, readily mobilizable stores of zinc that
can be rapidly released in response to variations in
dietary intakes of zinc. Instead, there is a&nbsp;small pool of rapidly
exchangeable zinc which is located in bone, liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen
and plasma and accounts for about 10&percnt; of whole-body zinc

target="right" >King et&nbsp;al., 2000</a>).</span>

This pool turns over com&shy;pletely about five times each day to provide zinc
for zinc-dependent meta&shy;bolic functions throughout the body. It is the
loss of a&nbsp;critical but small amount of zinc from this pool that leads
to the biochemical and clinical signs of zinc defi&shy;ciency

Bone may also
provide a&nbsp;passive reserve of zinc, especially during growth, so that
when dietary zinc intakes are low, less of the zinc released during
normal bone turnover, is re-deposited in the skeleton

More than 300 metallo&shy;enzymes require zinc as a&nbsp;catalyst for function or
regulation. During zinc defi&shy;ciency, their activity is decreased,
although their structure does not change, and with the addition
of zinc, enzyme activity is restored. Zinc metallo&shy;enzymes are involved
in nucleic acid meta&shy;bolism and cellular proliferation, differ&shy;entiation,
and growth; examples are listed in

Zinc also plays an essential structural role in the folding of some
proteins and a&nbsp;lack of zinc results in protein misfolding and the loss of
function. A finger-like structure, known as a&nbsp;zinc finger motif,
stabilizes the structure of a&nbsp;variety of proteins, including those
involved in cellular differ&shy;entiation or proliferation, signal
trans&shy;duction, cellular adhesion, or trans&shy;cription. Zinc fingers use
cysteine and histidine to form a&nbsp;tetrahedral Zn<sup>2&plus;</sup>
coordination com&shy;plex. The extent to which the intake of dietary zinc
affects the function of zinc finger proteins is unclear. Zinc also
maintains the structure of certain enzymes, notably the antioxidant
enzyme, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase  (Cu,Zn&#8209;SOD)

Over 3&percnt; of all identified human genes contain zinc finger proteins
that regulate gene expression by acting as trans&shy;cription factors. Gene
expression may also regulate the effects of zinc defi&shy;ciency on lipid
peroxidation, immune function, apoptosis, and neuronal function

Zinc is also involved in cell signaling through the
metal response element-binding trans&shy;cription factor&nbsp;1 (MTF1).
Whether MTF1 regulates genes negatively or positively appears to depend
on the cellular zinc status. Zinc may also have a&nbsp;direct regulatory
role controlling numerous cell-signaling pathways by modulating kinase
and phosphorylase activities.  For more details of the meta&shy;bolic
functions of zinc at the cellular level, see King and Cousins

Zinc-dependent cellular functions are coordinated by one or more
of twenty four zinc trans&shy;porters. Two classes of zinc trans&shy;porters exist:
ZIP proteins and ZnT proteins. It is the up-  or
down-regulation of these trans&shy;porter genes in response to zinc intake
that helps to maintain cellular zinc homeo&shy;stasis. The ZnT proteins
(n=10) generally trans&shy;port zinc ions out of the cytosol, whereas ZIP
(SLC 39) proteins (n=14) import the ions from the cellular com&shy;partments or
the extra&shy;cellular space into the cytosol. Individual ZIP and ZnT trans&shy;porters
are located in specific cell
types. For example, ZIP&#8209;14 appears to be involved in the uptake of zinc
by the liver in response to acute inflam&shy;mation and infection, whereas
ZnT3 is found in the synaptic vesicles of some types of neurons, and
ZnT8 in the secretory granules of &beta;&#8209;pancreatic cells

However, the role of many of the twenty four zinc trans&shy;porters and how their
expression is altered to maintain cellular zinc homeo&shy;stasis remains
uncertain

<h3 id="24c.1.2">24c.1.2  Physiological functions of zinc </h3>

Multiple physio&shy;logical functions are affected by zinc defi&shy;ciency due to
the ubiquitous involve&shy;ment of zinc in cellular meta&shy;bolism. A modest
deprivation in zinc intake over the long-term results in detectable
changes in growth, immune function, and possibly neuro&shy;behavioural
function. Other signs of marginal zinc defi&shy;ciency  include poor
appetite and impaired taste acuity (hypogeusia).
<p></p>
Impaired growth in zinc defi&shy;ciency arises from the role of zinc in DNA
trans&shy;cription and gene expression, signal trans&shy;duction pathways, and
endocrine function (e.g., insulin-like growth factor); these effects
are summarized in

Zinc is also required for the synthesis and functions of immune
regulatory proteins and for the maintenance of normal immune function.
Consequently, zinc defi&shy;ciency causes immune dysfunction. Both barrier function
and cellular com&shy;ponents of the innate immune responses (i.e., macrophage
and neutrophil function) are com&shy;promised as well as the
acquired immune system, with the largest effect being on reducing CD4 T cell
function

The decline in innate immunity with zinc
defi&shy;c&shy;iency promotes systemic inflam&shy;mation, charac&shy;terized by
elevated levels of proinflam&shy;matory cytokines. Supplementation with zinc

The mechanism whereby zinc influences neuro&shy;behavioral functioning is
not well established. In the central nervous system, zinc is
concen&shy;trated in the presynaptic vesicles of zinc-containing neurons,
which are found primarily in the forebrain and connect with other
cerebral cortices and limbic structures. During synaptic events, zinc
is released and passes into postsynaptic neurons, serving as
neuro&shy;trans&shy;mitters.  Zinc defi&shy;ciency may interfere with these processes
and thus com&shy;promise neuro&shy;behavioral functioning, especially during
times of rapid growth and development, such as infancy, when demands for
zinc are high

Meta-analysis, however, has failed to
show a&nbsp;significant overall effect  of zinc intake on biomarkers of
cognitive function in children, although the number of available
studies in this review was small (n=6)

There is some evidence that
zinc defi&shy;ciency may also be related to anxiety and depression. Possible
mechanisms that warrant investigation include the involve&shy;ment of zinc
in the uptake of the neuro&shy;trans&shy;mitter serotonin (5&#8209;HT) in the brain

<h3 id="24c.1.3">24c.1.3   Absorption and meta&shy;bolism of zinc </h3>

Zinc is mainly absorbed in the upper part of the small intestine by two
mechanisms: a&nbsp;saturable, carrier-mediated process and, secondly, by a&nbsp;non-mediated, or
passive process. Two families of zinc trans&shy;porters control the
trans&shy;port of zinc on the enterocyte membrane and account for the
saturable com&shy;ponent. Once zinc is absorbed into the enterocyte,
movement of zinc within the cell is influenced by metallo&shy;thionein and
the trans&shy;porter ZnT7. Export of zinc from the intestinal epithelial
cells into the portal vein is controlled by the ZnT1 trans&shy;porter. About
<span class="n">30&percnt;&ndash;40&percnt;</span> of the zinc in portal blood is exchanged with the liver,  the
main organ involved in zinc meta&shy;bolism. From the liver, zinc is
released into the systemic circulation for delivery to peripheral
tissues bound mainly to albumin  and &alpha;2&#x2011;macroglobulin

At such high doses (i.e., &gt;&nbsp;20mg/d Zn),
fractional absorp&shy;tion of zinc via the passive mechanism is very low,
suggesting that a&nbsp;dose of supple&shy;mental zinc above 20mg will have a
limited influence on zinc nutrition

Zinc homeo&shy;stasis in the body is tightly controlled over a&nbsp;wide range of
zinc intakes. This is achieved primarily by adjusting zinc excretion
through the gastro&shy;intestinal tract. Losses of zinc via the
gastro&shy;intestinal tract com&shy;prise both unabsorbed dietary zinc and
endogenous fecal zinc.  The sources of endogenous fecal zinc are
uncertain but probably include secretions from pancreatic and
intestinal mucosal cells.  When zinc intakes are very low, there is a
decrease in zinc secretion into the intestinal lumen, and endogenous
fecal zinc declines. With increasing zinc intakes, endogenous
fecal zinc losses increase to maintain homeo&shy;stasis. If the adult zinc intake
is extremely low (e.g., &lt;&nbsp;2mg/day), then the reductions
in losses of endogenous fecal zinc may be insufficient to re-establish
zinc homeo&shy;stasis. In these circumstances, additional meta&shy;bolic
adjustments occur to mobilize zinc from the small, exchangeable pool
located in liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, and possibly bone, to
maintain zinc-dependent functions

Unlike iron, absorp&shy;tion of zinc does not change in response to

Absorption of zinc can be measured / defi&shy;ned in two ways: (1) the fraction (or
percent) of zinc ingested that is absorbed (Fractional Zinc Absorption
or FZA), determined by the dividing the amount absorbed by the amount
digested, and (2) the total quantity of absorbed zinc (TAZ) over the
whole day.  The fraction of zinc absorbed depends on the
bioavailability of the ingested zinc, whereas the total quantity
absorbed is dependent mainly on the amount of zinc consumed and the
bioavailability of the zinc in the diet. Intake of dietary zinc affects
fractional zinc absorp&shy;tion and the total quantity of absorbed zinc
differ&shy;ently. With increasing zinc intakes, the total amount of absorbed
zinc increases while the percent absorbed declines

In addition to the amount of the dietary zinc intake,
the food sources of zinc may also affect zinc absorp&shy;tion.  The dietary
factor with the greatest effect on zinc absorp&shy;tion is phytic acid
(myoinositol hexakisphosphoric acid (InsP6) and its associated
magnesium, potassium, and calcium salts &mdash; termed phytates. Phytic acid
and its salts are found in high concen&shy;trations in unrefined cereals,
legumes, nuts and oil seeds. Phytate binds zinc in the intestinal lumen
and forms an insoluble com&shy;plex that cannot be digested or absorbed by
humans because of the absence of the intestinal enzyme phytase

This inhibitory effect on zinc absorp&shy;tion can be
sub&shy;stantial.   If the habitual diet is rich in phytate,
adults cannot adapt to increase zinc absorp&shy;tion

that alter the integrity of the mucosal cells, reduce zinc absorp&shy;tion,

<h3 id="24c.1.5">24c.1.5  Food sources and dietary intakes</h3>

There is no functional reserve or body store of zinc, as noted earlier, so an adequate
regular supply of readily absorbable zinc is required.
Hence, individuals consuming a&nbsp;usual diet low in zinc and/or with poor zinc
bioavailability may be nutritionally zinc defi&shy;cient. Food sources of readily
absorbable zinc include organ meats, red meat, poultry, fish, and
shellfish; oysters are one of the richest food sources of absorbable
zinc. In general, the amount of zinc is higher in dark red meat than in
white meat. Starchy roots, tubers, fruits, and vegetables have a&nbsp;low
zinc content. Zinc is less readily available in whole grain cereals,
nuts and legumes: their zinc content varies, depending on the
zinc content of the soil or fertilizer treatment, growing location, and
processing methods (e.g., milling of cereals). Loss of zinc from most
foods during cooking is minimal.
<p>
Several dietary com&shy;ponents have been investigated as potential
modifiers of zinc bioavailability. A systematic review, however,
concluded that for many of these potential modifiers, data were
insufficient to accurately determine their impact on zinc absorp&shy;tion

A notable exception is phytic acid
(myoinositol hexakisphosphoric acid (InsP6) and its associated
magnesium, potassium, and calcium 
salts &mdash; termed &ldquo;phytates&rdquo;  &mdash;
potent inhibitors of zinc absorp&shy;tion, as noted earlier.
In general, phytic acid and its
salts are found in high concen&shy;trations in unrefined cereals, legumes,
nuts and oil seeds. Concentations vary widely depending on the
botanical variety, environmental or climatic growing conditions, the use of
phosphate fertilizers, and the stage of maturation. The highest levels are
reached at seed maturity.  During some food-processing, preparation and
cooking practices, such as milling / pounding, soaking,
germination / malting, mixtamalization, or fermentation, phytate is
dephosphorylated to the lower myo-inositol phosphate forms (IP1 to
IP4) that don't inhibit zinc absorp&shy;tion

The inhibiting effect of phytate on zinc absorp&shy;tion follows a
dose-dependent response.  Hambidge and colleagues
have developed a&nbsp;trivariant model to predict the inhibitory effect of
differ&shy;ent levels of phytate on zinc absorp&shy;tion as a&nbsp;function of zinc
intake

Values for the phytate
content of raw and processed plant-based staples are available in the
FAO / INFOODS / IZiNCG Global Food Composition Database for Phytate.
<p>
Molar ratios of phytate-to-zinc of individual
foods or whole diets can be used to estimate the likely proportion of
zinc absorbed. Diets with a&nbsp;phytate-to-zinc molar ratio of more than about 15
have poor zinc bioavailability, whereas those with ratios between 5 and 15
are said to have medium bioavailability, and those with ratios less than 5
have good bioavailability

In the past, millimolar ratios of phytate &times; calcium : zinc were also used to
predict zinc absorp&shy;tion because dietary calcium was said to influence
the inhibitory effect of phytate on zinc bioavailability.  The use of this ratio

For each indicator, a&nbsp;&ldquo;trigger level&rdquo; is given

risk and of public health concern, at which level
an intervention to improve popu&shy;lation zinc status is warranted.

Assessment of zinc status at the individual level is particularly difficult because
serum or plasma zinc concen&shy;trations are homeo&shy;statically
controlled and do not decline with marginal zinc intakes.
Hence, serum or plasma zinc is only useful to measure
zinc status in individuals with either a&nbsp;very low or high supply of
dietary zinc. Instead, the recom&shy;men&shy;ded approach for
individuals com&shy;bines a&nbsp;medical history, dietary and

<h2 id="24c.2">24c.2  Dietary Zinc Intake  </h2>

Assessment of dietary zinc intakes is the best method for
estimating zinc exposure in individuals and popu&shy;lations.
To determine  dietary zinc intakes, a&nbsp;quantitative dietary method
such as a&nbsp;weighed or estimated food record or a&nbsp;validated 24-h
recall must be used.  Details of the procedures to estimate
dietary zinc intakes using a&nbsp;modified 24-hr recall specifically
for use in lower incom&shy;e countries are available in a&nbsp;Dietary
Technical Monograph (#8)

<p>
Information on dietary zinc intakes can be used for several purposes.
At the popu&shy;lation level, data can be used to: estimate the prevalence of inadequate zinc intakes, classify sub&shy;popu&shy;lations at elevated risk,
design and monitor zinc intervention programs, and
identify dietary patterns that contribute to inadequate zinc intakes.
At the individual level, those at risk of inadequate intakes can be
identified for dietary counseling. Tools have been developed to
facilitate the collection of dietary zinc intakes and analyze the
data to assess dietary adequacy

<p>
Inadequate intakes of dietary zinc can arise from low
intakes of zinc <i>per se,</i> poor bioavailability, or a&nbsp;com&shy;bination
of these dietary factors, as noted earlier. In low incom&shy;e countries,
where unrefined cereals and legumes
containing high levels of phytate	are often the
major source of energy and zinc, inadequate intakes of
bioavailable forms of zinc are the most likely cause of zinc defi&shy;ciency.
Other diets based on starchy roots or tubers have a&nbsp;low
total zinc and phytate content. Values for the phytate content of raw
and processed plant-based staples are available in
the FAO / INFOODS / IZiNCG Global Food Composition Database

When collecting dietary intake data for zinc, intakes of dietary
phytate should also be determined, whenever possible.
<p>
Data on both zinc and phytate intakes permit the calculation
of phytate-to-zinc molar ratios from which an estimate of the
bioavailability of zinc can be obtained, as noted in Section&nbsp;24c.1.5

The recom&shy;men&shy;ded dietary indicator to identify a&nbsp;popu&shy;lation or

Because information on usual zinc intakes is required,
food intakes must be measured on two non-consecutive days or three
consecutive days. It is preferable that multiple days of intake
data are collected for all individuals in the popu&shy;lation.
However, if this is not possible, then at least two non-consecutive
days of dietary intake data from a&nbsp;sub-sample 
<span class="n">(40&ndash;50)</span>
of individuals per stratum should be collected.

These data permit an estimate of the day-to-day variation in zinc
intake within one individual (i.e., within-person variation)
to be estimated, allowing a&nbsp;distribution of usual zinc intakes

software. Finally, the  Estimated Average
Requirements (EARs) for zinc,  specific for age, sex,

the prevalence of inadequate intakes. If quantitative data

<li>Calculate zinc and phytate intakes and dietary

an appropriate food com&shy;position database for the country.
For non-pregnant and non-lactating adults, the amount of zinc
likely to be absorbed may also be calculated.</li>
<li>Adjust the distribution of observed zinc intakes to represent usual

<li>Select the appropriate EAR and apply the EAR cutoff method
to estimate the prevalence of usual zinc intakes below the EAR.
Alternatively, in countries where local food com&shy;position values

depending on the sources of the data, the concepts and
methods used, as described in 	Gibson et al.

have generated dietary zinc require&shy;ments based on four levels of
dietary phytate intake for adults (> &nbsp;18y)
and said to cover the average phytate intakes in European
popu&shy;lations: (300mg/d; 600mg/d; 900mg/d; 1200mg/d).
In view of the uncertainty about whether recom&shy;men&shy;dations for
dietary zinc based on phytate intakes can also be made for
young children, the EFSA EARs for infants and children are
not adjusted for phytate.
<p>
The prevalence of usual zinc intakes below the EAR is simply
estimated by calculating the percentage of individuals within a&nbsp;specific
life-stage group with usual intakes below the respective EAR.
An elevated risk of zinc defi&shy;ciency in the popu&shy;lation is
said to exist when 25&percnt; or more of the popu&shy;lation have
zinc intakes less than the EAR. However, to assist with
the interpretation of the risk of zinc defi&shy;ciency,
it is recom&shy;men&shy;ded that estimates of the adequacy

Inferences can be made about the adequacy of the zinc intake of an individual by
com&shy;paring the differ&shy;ence between the estimate of the usual
zinc intake of the individual and the respective values for the EAR and
Recom&shy;mended Nutrient Intake (RNI) for zinc.  If the usual intake
of the individual is greater than the RNI, then there is a&nbsp;high level of confidence
that the usual intake is adequate, whereas if the usual intake is
between the EAR and the RNI, the usual zinc intake probably needs to be
improved, and if the usual intake is less than the EAR, then the
usual intake very likely needs to be improved. Details

Serum and plasma zinc concen&shy;trations can be used interchangeably

very small

Fasting serum zinc concen&shy;trations are homeo&shy;statically controlled within fairly narrow
limits (about 
<span class="n">80&ndash;100&micro;g/dL</span> 
<span class="n">(12&ndash;15&micro;mol/L).</span> Only 0.1&percnt; of the total
body zinc is present in the serum, whereas 3&percnt; and 63&percnt; are in the liver
and skeletal muscle, 
respectively  (<a href="#table24c.1">Table&nbsp;24c.1</a>). Of the zinc in whole
blood, from 12&percnt; to 22&percnt; is in the serum; the remainder is within the
erythrocytes.  Zinc is trans&shy;ported in the serum bound principally to
albumin (70&percnt;), so conditions that alter serum albumin levels will, in
turn, affect serum zinc concen&shy;trations. The remaining zinc in serum is
tightly bound to &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&#8209;macroglobulin (18&percnt;), and the rest is bound to other proteins such as trans&shy;ferrin and ceruloplasmin and to amino
acids, primarily histidine and cysteine

Evidence for this recom&shy;men&shy;dation is derived from investigations on the

serum zinc; (3) the association between serum zinc and clinical signs

In brief, in severe dietary zinc restriction (i.e., &lt;&nbsp;1mg/d)
in previously healthy adults, there is a&nbsp;sharp decrease in serum zinc
concen&shy;trations, with values returning to baseline levels within 
<span class="n">1&ndash;2&nbsp;weeks</span>
of zinc supple&shy;mentation

zinc responds less to additional zinc provided in food than to
additional zinc supplied as a&nbsp;supple&shy;ment administered between meals.

enteropathica. From these data, the sensitivity and specificity of a

Finally, if the initial serum zinc is very low,
a&nbsp;functional response to zinc supple&shy;mentation may occur.  Functional
responses may include increases in growth (including linear growth,
weight gain, and accrual of fat-free mass) and decreased morbidity from
diarrhea and respiratory infection. Of these responses, IZiNCG has

For an individual, serum zinc concen&shy;trations are not a&nbsp;reliable
indicator of zinc status due to both the strong homeo&shy;static control
mechanisms and the many factors other than zinc intake that can
independently influence serum zinc concen&shy;trations (see below).
This means that serum zinc concen&shy;trations may be within the normal
range despite the presence of mild zinc defi&shy;ciency generating growth
retardation, loss of appetite, or impaired immune function. Currently
for individuals the recom&shy;men&shy;ded approach com&shy;bines a&nbsp;thorough medical
history of risk factors for zinc defi&shy;ciency, a&nbsp;qualitative dietary
assessment to identify an inadequate dietary intake, and a&nbsp;clinical
assessment, with plasma or serum zinc providing only supple&shy;mentary data

<strong>Fasting status </strong>
also markedly affects serum zinc concen&shy;trations. During a&nbsp;usual
overnight fast of &ge;&nbsp;8h, serum zinc levels increase,
generally reaching a&nbsp;peak just before breakfast. Fluctuations in serum
zinc also occur throughout the day, mainly in response to the
consumption of meals. Serum zinc levels decline progressively for
several hours after each meal, before rising prior to the next meal

Hence, in addition to the time of day, fasting status


and meal status
should also be carefully controlled during the collection of
blood samples for serum / plasma zinc to avoid confounding
the results. Alternatively, the time of day and the time elapsed since the previous  meal
can be recorded and taken into account statistically during
analysis

The most frequently used method for the analysis of serum zinc is flame

Dilution of the
serum reduces the viscosity of the sample, which minimizes both the
matrix effect on the rate of aspiration and the tendency for the flame
atomic absorp&shy;tion burner-head to becom&shy;e blocked.
This may be especially a&nbsp;problem with
plasma because of precipitates that form in these samples. Sometimes
the serum or plasma samples are ashed at low temperatures prior to
analysis by flame AAS. For very small samples, flameless AAS can be
used.  Increasingly, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission
spectrom&shy;etry or ICP mass spectrom&shy;etry are being used.. For all methods,
in&#8209;house quality controls and standard reference materials (SRMs) such
as bovine serum (SRM 1598) from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology should be used. A coefficient of variation of &lt;&nbsp;5&percnt; is attainable
for zinc using flame AAS. Use of a&nbsp;trichloroacetic
acid deproteinization technique is not recom&shy;men&shy;ded.

<h2 id="24c.4">24c.4 Linear growth</h2>

The limited sensitivity and specificity of linear growth and
other similar &ldquo;bioindicators&rdquo; means linear
growth must be measured alongside other biomarkers of zinc (i.e., plasma or
serum zinc) and other growth-limiting nutrients to establish the role of zinc in
poor growth. There is no pharmacological effect of zinc on growth in
zinc-replete individuals and linear growth is considered the best functional

For infants and children &le; 85cm (i.e. &le; 2y), recumbent length
is  the recom&shy;men&shy;ded measure, preferably with the use of an infantometer with a
range of 
<span class="n">30&ndash;110cm,</span> equipped with a&nbsp;digital 
counter reader.  Recumbent
length should be recorded to the nearest millimeter, or even more
precisely (i.e., 0.1mm) when possible.  Wooden or acrylic length
measuring boards can be used, but they are rarely fitted with digital
counters so are less reliable.  Note that recumbent length for a&nbsp;child
of about 2y is about 5mm greater than standing height for the same child

<span class="n">(range 65&ndash;206cm),</span> again equipped 
with a&nbsp;digital counter reader capable of measuring
stature to 0.1mm.  Platform scales with movable measuring rods should
not be used as they are less accurate.
Clothing should be minimal when height measure&shy;ments are taken so that
posture can be clearly seen. Shoes and socks should not be worn. The
timing of the measure&shy;ment should be recorded; diurnal variations in
height occur due to com&shy;pression of the spine as the day progresses

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/568918"
target="right" >Buckler, 1978</a>). </span>

Consequently, in popu&shy;lation studies, standing height should always be measured at the
same time of day, preferably in the afternoon.
<p>
When measuring recumbent length or standing height, attempts should be
made to minimize measure&shy;ment errors. In longitudinal studies involving
sequential measure&shy;ments on the same group of individuals, one person
should conduct all of the measure&shy;ments throughout the study to
eliminate between-examiner errors. This is especially critical when
growth velocity is estimated; growth increments are generally small and
are associated with two error terms, one for each measure&shy;ment occasion.

They emphasize, however, that the need to collect a&nbsp;24&#8209;hour urine
sample and the lack of established cutoffs limit the usefulness of
urinary zinc as a&nbsp;biomarker. Moreover, because urinary zinc only
responds to very low dietary zinc intakes, its use as a&nbsp;biomarker of
dietary zinc intake among free-living popu&shy;lations is limited.

<h3 id="24c.5.1">24c.5.1   Measurement of urinary zinc excretion</h3>

The amounts of zinc excreted in the urine usually range from 300 to 600&micro;g/d. A 24-h urine collection is preferred because diurnal variation in
urinary zinc excretion may be significant. Measurements of urinary zinc
are usually performed by flame AAS.

<h2 id="24c.6">24c.6 Hair zinc concen&shy;trations </h2>

Zinc is incorporated into the hair matrix when the hair is
exposed to the blood supply during synthesis within the dermal papilla

When the growing hair approaches the skin
surface, the hair undergoes keratinization and the zinc accumulated
during its formation becom&shy;es sealed into keratin protein structures
and isolated from meta&shy;bolic processes.   Hence, the zinc content of the
hair shaft reflects the quantity of zinc available in the blood supply
at the time of the hair growth, not at the time of sampling

Consequently, positive correlations between hair and serum
zinc concen&shy;trations can only be expected in settings where zinc status
is unchanged or chronic zinc defi&shy;ciency exists. Assuming a&nbsp;normal rate
of hair growth (i.e., about 1cm hair growth/month), the zinc concen&shy;tration
in the proximal 
<span class="n">1&ndash;2cm</span> of hair (i.e., the hair

Nevertheless, several technical and biological factors

A cutoff point of 70&micro;g/g  (1.07&micro;mol/g)
has been established for hair zinc in young children
that appears to indicate risk of zinc defi&shy;ciency in both
clinical and popu&shy;lation studies. Cutoff points, unlike reference
limits, are generally based on data from individuals with either
clinical or functional manifestations of a&nbsp;nutrient defi&shy;ciency.  Zinc-related adverse health outcom&shy;es such as
impairments in linear growth, appetite, and taste acuity

An additional application for
hair zinc concen&shy;trations includes their use as a&nbsp;longer-term,
retrospective measure of zinc exposure in case-control studies. Of
note, is the existence of withon-person variability for hair zinc
which has the potential to attenuate estimates of association in
case-control or prospective cohort studies, as well as popu&shy;lation
prevalence estimates for risk of defi&shy;ciency

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26980156"

Such attenuation can be reduced by obtaining several replicate hair samples from
each individual in the group and applying the mean value to represent
true exposure.

<h3 id="24c.6.2">24c.6.2   Measurement of hair zinc </h3>

Hair specimens should be collected from a&nbsp;representative sample of the
target popu&shy;lation or sub&shy;groups of interest during the same season of
the year. Samples (at least 50mg) should be cut at skin level from the
occipital region of the scalp (i.e., across the back of the head in a
line between the top of the ears) with stainless steel scissors. Only
the proximal (i.e., closest to the scalp) 
<span class="n">1.0&ndash;2.0cm</span> of the hair
strands should be retained. These specimens will reflect the zinc
uptake by the follicles 
<span class="n">4&ndash;8 weeks</span> prior to sample collection provided
the rate of hair growth has been normal.  Hair samples should be placed
in labeled trace-element-free polyethylene bags for storage; any
remaining hair strands should be discarded. Before washing the
specimens to remove exogenous contaminants such as atmospheric
pollutants, water, and sweat, any nits and lice should be removed if
necessary using a&nbsp;microscope or magnifying glass and Teflon-coated
tweezers. For each specimen, details of the ethnicity, age, gender,
hair color, height, weight, date of collection, presence of
malnutrition (where relevant), and use of dandruff shampoos or cosmetic
treatments should always be recorded to aid in the interpretation of
the data.
<p>
Washing with nonionic detergents (e.g., Triton X&#8209;100) with or without
acetone is preferred for hair as these detergents are less likely to
leach bound zinc from the hair and yet are effective in removing
superficial adsorbed zinc. Washing with chelating agents such as EDTA
should be avoided because they remove some of the tightly bound zinc
that is an integral part of the hair sample

metal analysis. Clinical Chemistry 24: 391-392.   ">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/627086"
target="right" >Shapcott, 1978</a>).   </span>	
After washing and rinsing, the hair samples must be vacuum- or oven-dried
depending on the chosen analytical method, and stored in a&nbsp;desiccator
prior to laboratory analysis. For a&nbsp;detailed guide for
measuring hair zinc concen&shy;trations the reader is advised to consult
IZiNCG

<p>
Several laboratory methods can be used to measure hair zinc
concen&shy;trations in the washed specimens, depending on the instruments
available. Washed specimens can be be prepared for analysis using
microwave digestion when available, or wet or dry ashing, although
the  use of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to solubilize hair at room
temperature warrants investigation. The latter method eliminates
time-consuming ashing or wet digestion. Traditional analytical methods
include flame AAS or multi-element ICP&#8209;MS, although
non-destructive  instrumental neutron activation
analysis (INAA) can also be
used. For INAA the washed hair specimens are placed in small, weighed
trace-element-free polyethylene bags or tubes and oven-dried for 22&nbsp;hours
at 55&deg;C. After cooling in a&nbsp;desiccator, the packaged specimens
are sealed and weighed, prior to irradiation in a&nbsp;nuclear reactor.
<p>
Certified reference materials (CRM)s should always be used to assess
the accuracy and precision of the chosen analytical method for hair
zinc. Unsatisfactory quality control for hair trace element analysis
among laboratories is a&nbsp;widespread problem

A CRM for human hair is available (e.g., Community

Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements, Retieseweg, B&#8209;2440
Geel, Belgium. In-house controls prepared from a&nbsp;homogenous sample of
finely cut digested hair (or powdered for INAA)  should also be
prepared and spiked with several differ&shy;ent known quantities of zinc and
the recoveries measured. The in-house controls should be analyzed in
conjunction with a&nbsp;CRM periodically to monitor assay variations in the
instrument and digestion procedures.

<h2 id="24c.7">24c.7  Nail zinc</h2>

Fewer studies have examined nail zinc as a&nbsp;biomarker of zinc exposure
than hair zinc even though the validity of nail selenium as a&nbsp;biomarker
of selenium exposure in adults has been confirmed by several reports

Metallothionein is a&nbsp;small, cysteine-rich, metal-binding protein that
readily binds to zinc and heavy metals. Up to seven
zinc molecules can bind to one metallo&shy;thionein molecule,
that may serve as a&nbsp;small zinc reserve for cells.  The highest
concen&shy;trations of metallo&shy;thionein are found in the liver, kidney,

Smaller quantities of metallo&shy;thionein are also present in all tissue
cells, and concen&shy;trations in serum, erythrocytes, and monocytes have
been investigated as potential biomarkers of human zinc status. Serum
metallo&shy;thionein concen&shy;trations reflect changes in hepatic
metallo&shy;thionein, so any increase in hepatic levels in response to
stress, inflam&shy;mation etc., will result in concom&shy;itantly elevated levels
in serum, thus limiting the use of serum metallo&shy;thionein as a&nbsp;biomarker of zinc status.
<p>
In
contrast to serum, erythrocyte metallo&shy;thionein is not
responsive to stress and appears to be sensitive
to severe and moderate restrictions in dietary zinc intake, based on results of depletion-repletion studies

However, because most of
the metallo&shy;thionein in erythrocytes is concen&shy;trated in the reticulocyte
fraction, changes in erythropoiesis, as may occur with poor iron
status, influence total erythrocyte
metallo&shy;thionein levels.
With the advent of  com&shy;mercially available immunoassays
for metallo&shy;thionein, more research on the response of metallo&shy;thionein
concen&shy;trations in erythrocytes and other blood cell types to changes
in dietary zinc intake or status in com&shy;munity-based studies is now possible.
However, reference material for metallo&shy;thionein concen&shy;trations
is also needed to allow com&shy;parison of metallo&shy;thionein concen&shy;trations using

<h2 id="24c.9">24c.9 Metallothionein mRNA expression in
circulating blood cell types</h2>

Expression of the metallo&shy;thionein gene is induced by zinc through the binding
of zinc to metal-binding-regulatory trans&shy;cription factor 1 (MTF-1).
This trans&shy;cription factor is known to be sensitive to cellular zinc
concen&shy;trations, with metallo&shy;thionein synthesis increasing as cellular
zinc increases. Reverse trans&shy;criptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
assays can be used to measure the response of metallo&shy;thionein
expression in various blood cell types to changes in dietary zinc.

In all the studies, a&nbsp;depletion phase (mostly about 10 days)

supple&shy;mental zinc on metallo&shy;thionein expression in leukocytes based
on the percentage change from baseline. There
was a&nbsp;39&percnt; decrease from baseline in metallo&shy;thionein

and increases from baseline of 135&percnt; and 267&percnt;  for those
receiving 
<span class="n">15&ndash;22mg Zn/d</span> and 50mg Zn/d, respectively.

Hence these findings indicate that metallo&shy;thionein expression in
leukocytes is sensitive to changes in dietary zinc intake,
decreasing in zinc depletion, and increasing in response to zinc
supple&shy;mentation in a&nbsp;dose-dependent manner. However, these
changes were not associated with consistent changes in plasma zinc,
which suggests that metallo&shy;thionein expression in leukocytes may
be a&nbsp;more sensitive biomarker than plasma zinc for determining
zinc exposure. Of interest was the lack of sensitivity of
metallo&shy;thionein expression in erythrocytes to changes in
dietary zinc.
<p>
Clearly, further
work is needed to investigate whether metallo&shy;thionein expression
in leukocytes can be used as a&nbsp;biomarker of zinc status
among other age groups and free-living volunteers.
The effect of potential
confounders (e.g., inflam&shy;matory agents, free radicals,
glucocorticoids, and pharmacologic agents)needs to be explored.
In addition, more research is needed on whether the sensitivity to zinc
supple&shy;mentation and depletion is affected by variations in the proportions
of blood cell sub&shy;types among individuals. The abundance of metallo&shy;thionein
trans&shy;cript in monocytes is three times that of granulocytes,
and twice that found in T&nbsp;lymphocytes

<h2 id="24c.11">24c.11 Oxidative stress and DNA integrity</h2>

Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the
increased production of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS)
(superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals) and the
decreased protective action of antioxidants that are responsible
for the neutralization and removal of ROS.  Oxidative stress arising
from this imbalance has the potential to damage proteins,
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and lipids, and may serve as a
potential predictor in the development of differ&shy;ent ROS-dependent
diseases (e.g.,vascular diseases). Zinc plays an important
role in antioxidant defence and the maintenance of cellular DNA integrity.
As zinc itself is redox inert, it does not function as an
antioxidant <i>per se,</i> instead functioning indirectly as an
antioxidant and as a&nbsp;&ldquo;pro-oxidant&rdquo; over
a limited range of zinc concen&shy;trations. Consequently, the term &ldquo;
pro-antioxidant&rdquo; is used to describe the 
indirect functions of zinc as an antioxidant.
In contrast, outside this range, zinc is a&nbsp;pro-oxidant.
Hence, an increase in cellular oxidative stress and
DNA damage may be an early sign of both reductions
in cellular zinc as well as zinc overload.

Several human studies have investigated whether intracellular
DNA strand breaks, assayed using the com&shy;et assay, could serve as a&nbsp;functional biomarker of zinc status.  In an experimentally-controlled
depletion-repletion study in adult men with low intakes of
dietary zinc  for six weeks (i.e., 0.6mg Zn/d for one week
followed by 4mg Zn/d for five weeks), the number of
leukocytic DNA strand breaks increased, but declined when
dietary zinc intakes were increased to 11mg Zn/d for
four weeks

Another study of adult men
in which dietary zinc intakes containing 6mg Zn/d (with added
phytate) for two weeks were increased to 10mg Zn/d for
4&nbsp;weeks, also showed improvements in the repair of DNA strand breaks
with increased intakes of dietary zinc.
Serum protein concen&shy;trations associated with the
DNA repair process also increased, despite no change in plasma zinc

In a&nbsp;field setting in Ethiopia
a decrease
in DNA strand breaks was observed after supple&shy;menting
women with 20mg zinc as zinc sulfate
or placebo daily for 17&nbsp;days, again despite no significant changes in plasma zinc.
<p>
Taken together, these findings indicate that even modest
changes in dietary zinc appear to modulate DNA damage,
primarily by reducing cellular oxidative stress, and confirm the
sensitivity of the com&shy;et assay; see  Singh et&nbsp;al.

Of note, however, despite modest increases in dietary zinc, there were no measured changes in plasma
zinc concen&shy;trations, exchangeable zinc pool, erythrocyte or leukocyte
zinc concen&shy;trations and metallo&shy;thionein in leukocytes.
These findings indicate
that zinc attenuates oxidant stress over the range of
usual zinc intakes, and in that capacity zinc modulates
DNA damage.  Nevertheless, many other conditions alter
the redox state, so markers of oxidative stress, including
DNA strand breaks, are not specific biomarkers for zinc nutrition.
Hence, oxidative stress and DNA integrity were
classified as &ldquo;emerging&rdquo; biomarkers by the BOND

Isotopic tracer studies in conjunction with a&nbsp;model-based
com&shy;partmental analysis have identified and measured a&nbsp;relatively
small whole-body exchangeable pool of zinc (EZP).
This pool com&shy;prises the most meta&shy;bolically active forms of
zinc in the plasma, extra&shy;cellular fluid, liver, pancreas,
kidney, and intestine that make up about 10&percnt; of the whole-body
zinc. The EZP provides zinc for zinc-dependent functions
throughout the body and has a&nbsp;turnover rate of about 12.5&nbsp;days.
The size of EZP is estimated to contain 
<span class="n">150&ndash;200mg</span> zinc in adults,

the decline in EZP was

than plasma zinc concen&shy;trations.  Whether the size of EZP is
reduced by the meta&shy;bolic redistribution of zinc due to inflam&shy;mation

Isotopic tracer studies have also been used to
investigate changes in plasma zinc turnover rates as a&nbsp;biomarker
of zinc status. When the total body zinc content
is reduced, plasma zinc turnover rates are increased to
meet tissue needs. Normally, total plasma zinc turns over about 150 times per
day to provide zinc for numerous functions throughout the body.
Increases in the plasma turnover rate from about 
<span class="n">150&ndash;200</span>
times per day have been reported in healthy men as a
result of acute, severe zinc depletion (i.e., 0.23mg Zn/d)

<strong>Measurement of taste acuity</strong>
<p>
Several methods for testing
taste acuity are available. Usually, evaluation is based on assessment
of both the detection and recognition thresholds
for each of four taste qualities (e.g., sweet, salt, sour, bitter),
and sometimes umami (monosodium glutamate). The detection
threshold is defined as &ldquo;the lowest concen&shy;tration at which a&nbsp;taste
can just be detected&rdquo;; the recognition threshold is &ldquo;the
lowest concen&shy;tration at which the quality of the taste
stimulus can be recognized&rdquo;. The two thresholds are each
determined for one taste quality before proceeding to the next.
Several investigators have used this technique on young
children

target="right" >Buzina et&nbsp;al., 1980</a>).  </span>
<p>
An alternative technique that assesses only recognition thresholds
and is better suited to children who are easily distracted
and have short attention spans, has been developed

target="right" >Desor and Maller, 1975</a>).</span>		

In some of these studies on children, recognition thresholds for only one taste quality (often salt) have been determined. Salt is selected because taste perception to moderately salty solutions changed significantly during a&nbsp;zinc-depletion study of young adult men

Recognition thresholds for salt have been measured in a&nbsp;study of

Participants rinse a&nbsp;small amount (10mL) of each solution
around in their mouths, expectorate it, and are then asked
to identify the presented sample as salty or plain water.
Salt solutions of increasing or decreasing concen&shy;trations are
used, where appropriate, until the sub&shy;jects correctly
identify salt at one concen&shy;tration and fail to do so at the next
lower concen&shy;tration. Only 2 out of 10 judgments are allowed
to be incorrect before moving to the next higher or lower salt
concen&shy;tration. The midpoint between these two concen&shy;trations
is used as the recognition threshold for salt for each participant.

although so far, this method has not been
applied in studies of zinc status. For all taste acuity methods,
it is preferable to perform the tests midmorning, at least 2 hours
after a&nbsp;meal, with the same person administering the test on each
occasion. Many other factors affect taste function.
Hence, taste acuity should be used in conjunction with
other biomarkers to assess zinc status.
The BOND Zinc Expert Panel classified taste acuity as an &ldquo;emerging&rdquo; zinc biomarker.

<h2 id="24c.14">24c.14    Zinc-dependent enzymes</h2>

Although zinc serves in a&nbsp;catalytic role for over three hundred zinc
metallo&shy;enzymes, no single zinc-dependent enzyme has gained widespread
acceptance as a&nbsp;biomarker of zinc status in humans. Their response to
zinc defi&shy;ciency, even in experimental studies of zinc depletion-repletion, has
been very equivocal, and none have proved to be a
consistent biomarker of zinc status.  The physio&shy;logical
symptoms of zinc defi&shy;ciency probably reflect, a&nbsp;series of
biochemical changes

Several zinc metallo-enzymes have been investigated as possible
biomarkers of zinc status in plasma, erythrocytes, erythrocyte

&alpha;-D-manno&shy;sidase, extra&shy;cellular super&shy;oxide dismutase, nucleoside

the activity of alkaline phosphatase (EC&nbsp;3.1.3.1) in serum,
erythrocytes, or erythrocyte membranes has been most frequently
studied. In a&nbsp;systematic review of biomarkers of zinc status that

The separation of leukocytes and other specific cell types is
difficult, and some of the inconsistencies reported for leukocyte zinc
in zinc depletion-repletion studies may result from analyzing mixtures
of cell types (e.g., neutrophils and lymphocytes), with differ&shy;ent
half-lives and zinc concen&shy;trations.  Further, leukocytes and
other specific cellular types are prone to contamination from exogenous
sources of zinc and from platelets. Data are also difficult to
interpret because no consensus exists for the method used to express
zinc concen&shy;trations in leukocytes or specific cell types. Results can
be expressed on a&nbsp;mg/kg dry weight basis to eliminate the effects of
variable cell water content, but results expressed as ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells are
generally preferred

Additional
factors limiting the use of leukocyte zinc or the zinc content of
sub&shy;popu&shy;lations is the relatively large volumes of blood (i.e., 
about 5mL) required for the analysis, and the lack of established interpretive
criteria

<h2 id="24c.17">24c.17  Salivary zinc</h2>

Concentrations of zinc in saliva have been investigated as a&nbsp;measure of
zinc status because zinc appears to be a&nbsp;com&shy;ponent of gustin, an
essential protein involved in taste acuity, that may be impaired by
marginal zinc defi&shy;ciency

Zinc concen&shy;trations in mixed
saliva, parotid saliva, salivary sediment, and salivary supernatant
have all been investigated, but their use as biomarkers of zinc status
is equivocal

As well, although the collection of saliva
samples is quick and relatively noninvasive, the rate of flow and
stimulation of saliva is difficult to control, and diurnal variation in
zinc levels may occur

concen&shy;trations in human stimulated parotid saliva.

In view of these problems,
and the contradictory results observed, the use of salivary zinc as a
biomarker of zinc status has been abandoned.

<h2 id="24c.18">24c.18  Multiple biomarkers </h2>

The efficient regulation of zinc homeo&shy;stasis com&shy;plicates the assessment
of zinc defi&shy;ciency and excess, and currently there is no single,
sensitive, specific biomarker of zinc status.
At the popu&shy;lation level, three biomarkers have been
recom&shy;men&shy;ded by WHO / UNICEF / IAEA /IZiNCG

defi&shy;ciency. They are itemized in Section&nbsp;24c.1.7.   Details on the measure&shy;ment and
interpretation of these biomarkers are available from IZiNCG

and a&nbsp;table listing the relative
strengths and weaknesses of the biomarkers is summarized in
<span data-tippy-content="King JC, Brown KH, Gibson RS, Krebs NF, Lowe NM,

For each biomarker, an indicator has been developed to estimate risk of zinc
defi&shy;ciency at the popu&shy;lation level. These are: (a) the prevalence of usual zinc intakes below the estimated average
require&shy;ment (EAR), (b) the percentage of the popu&shy;lation with low serum zinc
concen&shy;trations below the appropriate reference limit, and (c) the percentage of
children less than 5y with
length- or height-for-age less
than &minus;2SD below the age-specific median of the reference popu&shy;lation

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16817681"
target="right" >WHO, 2006</a>).</span>	
For each indicator, a&nbsp;&ldquo;trigger level&rdquo; for the prevalence
considered indicative of elevated risk and of public health concern is
given, at which level an intervention to improve popu&shy;lation zinc status
is warranted.  Ideally, all three indicators should be included in a
survey to strengthen the conclusion regarding the zinc status of the
popu&shy;lation and the need for an intervention, although in practice, this
is not always possible.   <span data-tippy-content="de Benoist B, Darnton-Hill I, Davidsson L, Fontaine O,.

suggest selecting indicators
according to the level of available resources:  (Box 24.7)
<p>
<div class="box"><b>Box 24c.7.</b>

<ul><li>	<strong>	Limited resources available  </strong>   Review existing evidence:
Stunting rates (height&ndash; or length&ndash;for&ndash;age Z-score &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2SD) of children under 5y;
Dietary patterns and likelihood of providing adequate bioavailable zinc in the food supply;
Results from clinical, com&shy;munity-based studies of functional response to zinc supple&shy;ments;
Results from com&shy;munity-based studies on dietary zinc intakes or serum zinc concen&shy;tration</li>

<li>	<strong>	Some resources available  </strong>   Augment existing information with data collected in a&nbsp;prospective survey. This would
normally be linked with other health/nutrition surveys with broader goals:
In at least a&nbsp;sub&shy;sample of the survey popu&shy;lation, or samples focused among sub&shy;popu&shy;lations
that are likely beneficiaries of nutrition or health interventions.  Include
serum zinc concen&shy;tration and/or dietary zinc intake adequacy as biomarkers;
where food-based interventions may be considered, at least 1&nbsp;day of
24&#8209;hour recall
per individual in the sample should be com&shy;pleted</li>

<li>	<strong>	Adequate resources available  </strong>   Where resources permit:
Serum zinc concen&shy;tration should be determined in a&nbsp;representative sample of all relevant
sub&shy;popu&shy;lation groups;
24&#8209;hour dietary recalls, or other locally validated quantitative dietary assessment
methods, should be repeated on nonconsecutive days on at
least a&nbsp;sub&shy;sample to estimate the distribution of usual zinc intakes </li>
</ul>	
</div>	


<p>
For individuals, unless zinc defi&shy;ciency is severe, moderate or mild zinc defi&shy;ciency can be present in the
absence of abnormal zinc biomarkers, including serum zinc, despite
the presence of disturbances such as growth retardation, loss of
appetite, and impaired immune function. Hence, for assessing the zinc status of individuals, the
recom&shy;men&shy;ded approach is based on a&nbsp;medical history, a&nbsp;qualitative
assessment of the diet, and a&nbsp;clinical assessment, with plasma or serum
zinc providing only supple&shy;mentary data
