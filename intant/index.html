<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Anthropometric measurements are used to assess body size
and body composition. The measurements are simple, safe,
and non-invasive and provide information on past exposure,
but cannot detect short-term disturbances or deficiency
of a specific nutrient. There are three major sources
of error in anthropometry: (i) measurement errors,
(ii) alterations in the composition and physical
properties of certain tissues, and, (iii) use of invalid
assumptions in the derivation of body composition
from the measurements.
<p>
Anthropometric indices are
derived from two or more raw measurements and are
essential to interpret and group the anthropometric data.
Selection of indices must take into account their sensitivity,
specificity, predictive value, and any potential
modifying factors.
<!-- (e.g., birth weight,
gestational age, maturation for adolescents). -->
Examples of indices include weight-for-height,
body mass index (weight kg) / (height m)<sup>2</sup>,
and waist-hip circumference ratio.
Anthropometric indices are often evaluated
by comparison with
predetermined reference limits or cutoff points.
Calculation of the number and proportion of individuals (as %) with
anthropometric indices below or above a
designated reference limit or cutoff, generates &ldquo;anthropometric
indicators&rdquo; that can be used in clinical and public health settings
to classify individuals at risk of malnutrition.
Examples of indicators used in this way
include  mid&#8209;upper&#8209;arm
circumference (MUAC) with a cutoff &lt;&nbsp;115mm to
identify severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children 6&ndash;60mos,
and WHZ &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2,
BMIZ &gt;&nbsp;&plus;2, and HAZ &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2,
used by WHO and UNICEF to define
wasting, overweight, and stunting respectively in
children &lt;&nbsp;5y and to define
prevalence thresholds and identify priority countries.
Cutoffs, unlike statistically derived reference limits,
are based on functional impairment or clinical
signs of malnutrition, and occasionally mortality.
<p>
The reference growth data recommended by WHO for international use are the
prescriptive WHO Child Growth Standards for 0&ndash;5y, and the WHO
growth reference data for older 5&ndash;19y.
Updated childhood growth charts are also available
for U.S.&nbsp;infants age 0&ndash;36mos and children 2&ndash;20y.
<!--
Other distance growth reference data available
include a tempo-conditional growth reference,
parent-allowed-for-growth reference,
growth velocity reference data, and specialized
growth charts for children with certain genetic disorders.
Prescriptive growth standards for fetal, newborn growth,
postnatal preterm growth, and gestational
weight gain have also been compiled for international use.
-->
Local reference data are preferred for body composition,
although few are available. Instead, WHO
recommends using reference data for MUAC,
triceps, and subscapular skinfolds collected
for the WHO Child Growth Standards.

as:

Subsequently, a number of publications made recom&shy;mendations on specific body
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments for characterizing nutri&shy;tional status, standardized
mea&shy;sure&shy;ment techniques, and suitable reference data

Today, anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
are widely used for the assessment of nutri&shy;tional status and health, at both the
individual and population levels.  One of their main advantages is that
anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments may be related to past exposures, to present
processes, or to future events

<p>
For individuals in low-income countries,
anthro&shy;pometry is partic&shy;ularly useful when there is
a chronic imbalance between intakes of energy,
protein, and certain micronutrients.
Such disturbances modify the patterns of physical growth and the relative
proportions of body tissues such as fat, muscle, and total body water.
For individuals in clinical
settings, anthro&shy;pometry can be used to diagnose failure
to thrive in infants and young children,
and monitor over&shy;weight and obesity in children and adults.
<p>
At the population level, anthro&shy;pometry has an important role in targeting
inter&shy;ventions through screening, in assessing the response to
inter&shy;ventions, in identi&shy;fying the deter&shy;minants and consequences of
mal&shy;nu&shy;trition, and in conducting nutri&shy;tional surveillance.
Increasingly, anthro&shy;pometry is also being used to characterize
and compare the health and nutri&shy;tional
status of populations across countries

<h3 id="9.1">9.1  Mea&shy;sure&shy;ments, indices, and indicators</h3>

Anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments are
of two types.  One group of mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
assesses body size, the other group appraises body
composition. The most widely used mea&shy;sure&shy;ments of body size
are stature (length or height), weight, and head
circum&shy;ference; see Chapter&nbsp;10 for more details. The anthro&shy;pometric
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments of body composition are based on
the classical &ldquo;two component model&rdquo; in which
the body is divided into two major compartments,
fat mass and the fat free mass.
Skinfold thickness mea&shy;sure&shy;ments are used to
estimate of the size of the sub&shy;cu&shy;taneous fat depot, which,
in turn provides an estimate of total body fat: over
one third of  total body fat is estimated to be
sub&shy;cu&shy;taneous fat. The distri&shy;bution of body fat is
also important, with the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of waist
circum&shy;ference used increasingly as a
proxy for the amount of intra-abdominal visceral fat. Waist circum&shy;ference
is recom&shy;mended for use in  population studies

<span data-tippy-content="World Health Organization. (‎2011)‎. Waist circumference and waist-hip ratio : report of a WHO expert consultation, Geneva, 8-11 December 2008. World Health Organization.">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241501491"
target="right" >WHO, 2011</a>)</span>,

as well as in clinical practice for the evaluation and
management of patients with over&shy;weight or obesity

<span data-tippy-content="Ross, R., Neeland, I. J., Yamashita, S., Shai, I., Seidell, J., Magni, P., Santos, R. D., Arsenault, B., Cuevas, A., Hu, F. B., Griffin, B.

<p>
The fat-free mass consists of the skeletal muscle,
non-skeletal muscle, soft lean tissue, and the skeleton.
A major component of the fat-free mass is body muscle.
As this is composed of protein, assessment of muscle mass
can provide an indirect assessment of the protein reserves
of the body. Measure&shy;ments of thigh circum&shy;ference and
mid-upper-arm circum&shy;ference (MUAC) can be used to
assess skeletal muscle mass

<span data-tippy-content="M&uuml;ller, M. J., Braun, W., Pourhassan, M., Geisler, C., & Bosy-Westphal, A. (2016). Application of standards and models in body composition analysis. The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 75(2), 181–187.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26541411/"
target="right" >M&uuml;ller et&nbsp;al., 2016</a>).</span>

Measure&shy;ment of MUAC is especially useful for young
children &lt;&nbsp;5y in emergency settings such as famines
and refugee crises.  In such settings, children often have a small
amount of sub&shy;cutan&shy;eous fat, so changes in MUAC
tend to parallel changes in muscle mass; see Chapter&nbsp;11 for more details.
<p>
Anthro&shy;pometric indices are usually calculated from two or
more raw mea&shy;sure&shy;ments, and are essential for
the inter&shy;pretation and grouping of mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
collected in nutri&shy;tional assessment. For example,
the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of a child's body weight is
meaningless unless it is related to the age or
height of a child. In young children the three
most commonly used growth indices are weight-for-age,
height-for-age, and weight-for-height.  The first two
indices reflect body weight or height
relative to chronological age, whereas weight-for-height
assesses body weight relative to height.
<p>
Body mass index (BMI) is also widely used in children and adults
to assess under&shy;weight, over&shy;weight, and obesity, and is calculated as
(weight kg) / (height m)<sup>2</sup>. When height cannot be measured,
as may occur in bed-bound or frail individuals,
published equations based on a range of body mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
such as knee height, lower leg length,
arm span, and ulna length can be used to provide
an approximate estimate of height. Examples of equations
for estimating height from these body mea&shy;sure&shy;ments in adults
are given in Madden et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Madden, A. M., & Smith, S. (2016). Body composition and morphological assessment of nutritional status in adults: a review of anthropometric variables. Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association, 29(1), 7–25. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25420774/"
target="right" >2016</a>).</span>

However, their usefulness
for hospitalised patients may be questionable, if the equations
have been derived from young and healthy populations

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24527991/"
target="right" >Reidlinger et&nbsp;al., 2014</a>)</span>.
<p>
Examples of body composition indices include a
combination of triceps skinfold and mid-upper-arm
circum&shy;ference, which together can be used to estimate
mid-upper-arm fat area and mid-upper-arm muscle
circum&shy;ference or area, surrogates for total body fat
content, and muscle mass, respectively.
Other mea&shy;sure&shy;ment combinations include the waist-hip ratio
(i.e., the waist circum&shy;ference divided by the hip circum&shy;ference),
an additional index of the distri&shy;bution of body fat which
can be measured more precisely than skinfolds.
Moreover,  mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
of waist-hip ratio as a surrogate for abdominal obesity,
appear to be a stronger inde&shy;pen&shy;dent risk factor for
risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and premature
death than BMI, especially among men

<p>
In an effort to obtain more reliable estimates of per&shy;cent&shy;age
body fat and fat-fat-free mass based on anthro&shy;pometric
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments in healthy adults,
the sum of skinfold thickness mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
from multiple anatomical sites is also used in
conjunction with population-specific or generalized
regression equations to predict body density, and
in turn, the per&shy;cent&shy;age of body fat using one of
three empirical equations. Once the per&shy;cent&shy;age of body
fat is calculated, total body fat content and the
fat-free mass can be derived (see Chapter&nbsp;11
for more details). Again, many of the
prediction equations were developed on young, healthy, lean Caucasian
population groups and, hence, are less appro&shy;priate for malnourished,
obese, or elderly subjects or for other racial groups.
<p>
Anthropometric indices are often evaluated by
comparison with the distri&shy;bution of appro&shy;priate anthropometric
reference data using standard
deviation scores (Z&#8209;scores) or per&shy;cen&shy;tiles.
(see
<a href="#9.4.3">Section&nbsp;9.4.3</a>).
From this, the number and
proportion of individuals (as&nbsp;%) with anthropometric
indices below or above a predetermined
reference limit or cutoff are often calculated.
A commonly used reference limit for the three main growth
indices is a Z&#8209;score of &minus;2 (i.e., below the WHO
reference median) (<a href="#9.4.2">Section&nbsp;9.4.2</a>).
When used in this way, the index and its associated
reference limit or cutoff become an &ldquo;indicator&rdquo;; these
are discussed below.
<p>
Anthro&shy;pometric indicators are constructed from
anthro&shy;pometric indices, with the term &ldquo;indicator&rdquo; relating
to their use in nutri&shy;tional assessment, often for public health,
or socio-medical decision-making at the population level. Indicators are also
used in clinical settings to identify individuals at risk of malnutrition.
To be valid, a substantial proportion of the variability
of an anthro&shy;pometric indicator should be associated
with differences in nutri&shy;tional status. WHO

<span data-tippy-content="Physical status: the use and interpretation of anthropometry. Report of a WHO Expert Committee. (1995). World Health Organization technical report series, 854, 1–452.">

target="right" >1995</a>)</span>

provide a detailed classification of recom&shy;mended
anthro&shy;pometric indicators based on their uses for
both targeting and assessing response to inter&shy;ventions,
identi&shy;fying deter&shy;minants of mal&shy;nu&shy;trition,
or predicting mal&shy;nu&shy;trition
in populations of infants and children.
<p>
Anthro&shy;pometric indicators should be chosen carefully in relation to
both their proposed use and their attributes.
Indicators vary in their validity, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive
value; these characteristics are discussed briefly in
<a href="#9.4.3">Section&nbsp;9.4.3</a>.
For example, although the indicator
weight-for-age &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score is
still widely used in health centers in many low-income countries
for screening young children at risk of malnutrition, it is inappro&shy;priate.
Children who are stunted but of normal weight,
or alternatively, tall and thin may be
incorrectly diagnosed as &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;.
Instead, in these countries, the indicator
length/height-for-age &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score
should be used

Further, several factors will affect the magnitude of the
expected response of an anthropometric indicator. These may include
the degree of defi&shy;ciency, age, sex, and physiological
state of the target group. Some
examples of frequently used anthro&shy;pometric indicators
and their corresponding application are shown in
<a href="#table9.1">Table&nbsp;9.1</a>.

<h3 id="9.2">9.2 Advantages and limitations of anthro&shy;pometry</h3>

Anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments are of increasing importance in nutri&shy;tional assessment as
they have many advantages (Box&nbsp;9.1).  However, anthro&shy;pometric measures
are relatively insensitive and cannot detect disturbances in nutri&shy;tional
status over short periods of time.  Further&shy;more, nutri&shy;tional
anthro&shy;pometry cannot identify any specific nutrient defi&shy;ciency and,
therefore, is unable to distinguish disturbances in growth and body
composition induced by nutrient deficiencies (e.g., zinc) from those
caused by imbalances in protein and energy intake.
<p>
Certain non-nutri&shy;tional factors (such as disease, genetic influences,
diurnal variation, and reduced energy expenditure) can lower the
specificity and sensitivity of anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
(Section&nbsp;1.4),
although such effects generally can be excluded or taken into
account by appro&shy;priate sampling and experi&shy;mental design.
<p>
Nevertheless, nutri&shy;tional anthro&shy;pometry can be used to monitor changes in both growth
and body compo&shy;sition in individuals (e.g., hospital patients) and in
population groups, provided sources of mea&shy;sure&shy;ment error and the effects
of confounding factors are minimized

<h3 id="9.3">9.3 Errors in anthro&shy;pometry </h3>

Errors can occur in nutri&shy;tional anthro&shy;pometry which may
affect the precision, accuracy, and validity of the mea&shy;sure&shy;ments, and
thus indices and indicators.  Three major sources of error are significant:  mea&shy;sure&shy;ment
errors, alterations in the compo&shy;sition and physical properties of
certain tissues, and the use of invalid assumptions in the derivation of
body compo&shy;sition from anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments

<span data-tippy-content="Heymsfield, S. B., and Casper, K. (1987). Anthropometric assessment of the adult hospitalized patient. JPEN. Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition, 11(5 Suppl), 36S–41S.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3312693/"
target="right" >Heymsfield and Casper, 1987</a>)</span>.
<p>
Measure&shy;ment errors arise from examiner error resulting from
inadequate training, instru&shy;ment error, and difficulties in making the
mea&shy;sure&shy;ment (e.g., skinfold thicknesses).  The major sources of
mea&shy;sure&shy;ment error in anthro&shy;pometry are shown in Boxes 9.2 and 9.3.
Both random and sys&shy;tem&shy;atic mea&shy;sure&shy;ment errors may occur
which reduce the validity of the index and any indicator
constructed from the index; they have been extensively reviewed by

Random mea&shy;sure&shy;ment errors limit precision or the extent
to which repeated mea&shy;sure&shy;ments of the same variable give the same value.
Random mea&shy;sure&shy;ment errors can be minimized by training
personnel to use standardized techniques and precise,
correctly calibrated instru&shy;ments

Further&shy;more, the precision (and accuracy)
of each mea&shy;sure&shy;ment technique
should be firmly established prior to use.  To improve precision,
two or three mea&shy;sure&shy;ments on each individual should be conducted.
<p>

WHO Multi&shy;center Growth Reference Study (MGRS)
are available in de&nbsp;Onis et&nbsp;al.

as well as in an anthro&shy;pometric training video from WHO.  In the WHO MGRS
the equipment was calibrated regularly, using standard weights
over the full weight range for the portable electronic
weighing scales, metal rods of known length for both the
infantometer and stadiometer, and calibration blocks of
varying widths for the skinfold calipers.
<p>
Poor precision often reflects within-examiner error, but between-examiner
error may also be significant in surveys with multiple examiners.  The
precision of a mea&shy;sure&shy;ment technique can be assessed by calculating:

<ul>
<li>
Technical error of the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment (TEM)
<li>
per&shy;cent&shy;age technical error (%TEM)
<li>
Coefficient of reliability (R)
</li>
</ul>

These parameters can be
calculated for each anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ment technique from repeated
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments on each subject made within a few minutes to avoid
physiological fluctuations.  A minimum of 10 subjects is recom&shy;mended.

<b>The technical error of the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment (TEM)</b> is the square root of the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment
error variance. TEM is expressed in the same units as that of the anthro&shy;pometric
mea&shy;sure&shy;ment under study and is often age
dependent. The value is also related to the anthro&shy;pometric
characteristics of the study group.  The calculation varies according to
the number of replicate mea&shy;sure&shy;ments made.  For one examiner making two
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments,
TEM =

<b>Per&shy;cent&shy;age TEM</b> has been recom&shy;mended
 to overcome the difficulty of the TEM being dependent on
the size of the original mea&shy;sure&shy;ment

The per&shy;cent&shy;age technical error of
the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment is analogous to the coefficient of variation and is calculated as:

\[\small\mbox{%TEM = (TEM/mean) × 100% }  \]

Note that %TEM has no units and can be used to make
direct comparisons of all types of anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments.  It
cannot be used, however, when more than one examiner is involved, as
then both within- and between-examiner errors are involved.  Ulijaszek
and Kerr

describe ways to deal with this more complex case.
<p>
<b>The coefficient of reliability (R)</b>
is an alternative approach that is widely used
for comparing mea&shy;sure&shy;ment errors
among anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments.
It ranges from 0&nbsp;to&nbsp;1 and can be
calculated using the following equation:

\[\small\mbox{ R = 1 &minus;((TEM)}^{2}/ \mbox{s} ^{2}) \]

where s<sup>2</sup> is the between-subject variance.  The coefficient
indicates the proportion of between-subject variance in a measured
population which is free from
mea&shy;sure&shy;ment error.  Hence, a mea&shy;sure&shy;ment
with R&nbsp;&equals;&nbsp;0.95 indicates that 95% of the variance is due to factors other
than mea&shy;sure&shy;ment error.
<p>
Whenever possible, a coefficient of reliability
&gt;&nbsp;0.95 should be sought.  Coefficients of reliability can be used to
compare the relative reliability of different anthro&shy;pometric
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments, and the same
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments in different age groups, as well
as for calculating sample sizes in anthro&shy;pometric surveys.
<p>
More details of standardization procedures and calculation of precision using TEM,
per&shy;cent&shy;age TEM, and coefficient of reliability are given in Lohman et&nbsp;al.

In general, the precision of weight and height
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments are high.  However, for waist and hip circum&shy;ferences,
between-examiner error tends to be large and it is preferable for only
one examiner to take these mea&shy;sure&shy;ments.  Because skinfolds are
notoriously imprecise, both within- and between-examiner errors can be
large.  Therefore, rigorous training using standardized techniques and
calibrated equipment are critical when skinfold mea&shy;sure&shy;ments are taken.

<h3 id="9.3.2">9.3.2.  Sys&shy;tem&shy;atic mea&shy;sure&shy;ment errors and accuracy</h3>

Sys&shy;tem&shy;atic mea&shy;sure&shy;ment
errors affect the accuracy of anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments or how close
the mea&shy;sure&shy;ments are to the true value.  The most common form of
sys&shy;tem&shy;atic error in anthro&shy;pometry results from equipment bias.  For
example, apparent discrepancies in skinfold mea&shy;sure&shy;ments performed on
the same person but with different calipers may be due to compression
differences arising from variations in spring pressure and surface area
of the calipers

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2094930/"
target="right" >Gruber et&nbsp;al., 1990</a>)</span>.

Errors arising from bias reduce the accuracy of the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment
by altering the mean or median value, but have no effect on the variance. Hence, such
errors do not alter the  precision of the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment.
<p>
The timing of some anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
of body size and compo&shy;sition is also known to be critical, partic&shy;ularly
for short-term growth studies:  progressive decreases in the height of
an individual during the day as a consequence of compression
of the spinal column, for example, may seriously compromise the accuracy of
height velocity mea&shy;sure&shy;ments.
<p>
The deter&shy;mination of accuracy in
anthro&shy;pometry is difficult because the correct value of any
anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ment is never known with absolute certainty.  In
the absence of absolute reference standards, the accuracy of
anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments is estimated by comparing them with those
made by a criterion anthro&shy;pometrist


<span data-tippy-content="Ulijaszek, S. J., & Kerr, D. A. (1999). Anthropometric measure&shy;ment error and the assessment of nutritional status. The British journal of nutrition, 82(3), 165–177.">

four anthro&shy;pometrists were trained and standardized against a

Attempts should always be made to
minimize mea&shy;sure&shy;ment errors.  In longitudinal studies involving
sequential anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ments on the same group of individuals
(e.g., surveillance), it is preferable, whenever possible, to have one
person carrying out the same mea&shy;sure&shy;ments throughout the study to
eliminate between-examiner errors.  This is partic&shy;ularly critical when
increments in growth and body compo&shy;sition are calculated; such
increments are generally small and are associated with two error terms,
one on each mea&shy;sure&shy;ment occasion.  Recom&shy;mendations for the minimum
intervals necessary to provide reliable data on growth increments during

<p>
In large regional surveillance studies, it is
often necessary to use several well-trained anthro&shy;pometrists.  In such
circumstances, the between-examiner differences among anthro&shy;pometrists
must be monitored throughout the study to maintain the quality of the
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments and thereby to
identify and correct sys&shy;tem&shy;atic errors in
the mea&shy;sure&shy;ments.  This practice was followed during the
WHO&nbsp;MGRS

<span data-tippy-content="de&nbsp;Onis, M., Onyango, A. W., Van den Broeck, J., Chumlea, W. C., & Martorell, R. (2004).

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15069917/"
target="right" >de&nbsp;Onis et&nbsp;al., 2004</a>)</span>.
<p>
In studies involving two longitudinal mea&shy;sure&shy;ments,
the TEM can be calculated to estimate the proportion of the difference
that can be attributed to mea&shy;sure&shy;ment error.  For example, with a TEM of
0.3 for a given anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ment,
the TEM for the difference
between two mea&shy;sure&shy;ments is:
<img src="figures/equat03.jpg" class="center" width="200" alt="equat">
because both TEM values contribute to the
variance in the difference.  Only if the difference
exceeds <span class="n">2 &times; 0.42 &equals; 0.84</span>
is there a 95% probability that the difference exceeds the
mea&shy;sure&shy;ment error alone.
<p>
Once assured that such differences are not a
function of mea&shy;sure&shy;ment error, then any changes in growth and body
compo&shy;sition can be correlated with factors such as age, the onset of
disease, response to nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;vention therapy, and so on.
<p>
The collection of longitudinal anthro&shy;pometric data is more time consuming,
expensive, and laborious than from cross-sectional surveys, and, as a
result, the sample size is generally smaller.  Hence, the probability of
sys&shy;tem&shy;atic sampling bias
(Section&nbsp;1.4.2)
is generally greater than in more extensive cross-sectional surveys.
<p>
For cross-sectional studies,
the examiners should be rotated among the subjects to reduce the effect

Cross-sectional surveys are useful for comparing population groups,
provided that probability sampling techniques have been used to ensure
that the samples are represen&shy;tative of the populations from which they
are drawn (Chapter&nbsp;1). Recently WHO has provided countries with tools
to develop or strengthen their surveillance systems so they
have the capacity to monitor changes in the Global Nutri&shy;tion
Targets for 2030. They  include the following
anthro&shy;pometric indicators: stunting,
wasting, low birthweight, and childhood over&shy;weight.

<h3 id="9.3.3">9.3.3  Errors from changes in tissue compo&shy;sition and properties</h3>

Variation in the compo&shy;sition and physical
properties of certain tissues may occur in both healthy and diseased
subjects, resulting in inaccuracies in certain anthro&shy;pometric
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments.  Even among healthy individuals, body weight may be
affected by variations in tissue hydration with the menstrual cycle

For example, repeated mea&shy;sure&shy;ments of skinfolds, over
a short period (i.e., 5min), may actually decrease accuracy of
skinfolds because later mea&shy;sure&shy;ments are more compressed due to the
expulsion of water from the adipose tissue at the site of the earlier
mea&shy;sure&shy;ment

The accuracy of waist circum&shy;ference is affected by both the phase
of respiration at the point of mea&shy;sure&shy;ment and by the tension
of the abdominal wall. The phase of respiration is important
because it deter&shy;mines the extent of fullness of the lungs and
the position of the diaphragm at the time of the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment.
Increasing the tension of the abdominal wall (by sucking in)
is frequently an unconscious reaction which is also important
because it reduces the waist mea&shy;sure&shy;ment. To minimize these
errors, WHO

<h3 id="9.3.4">9.3.4 Invalid models and errors in body compo&shy;sition</h3>

Invalid assumptions may lead to erroneous estimates of body compo&shy;sition
when these are derived from anthro&shy;pometric
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments, especially in
obese or elderly patients and those with protein-energy mal&shy;nu&shy;trition or
certain disease states.  For instance, use of skinfold thickness
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments to estimate total body fat assumes that (a) the thickness
of the sub&shy;cu&shy;taneous adipose tissue reflects a constant proportion of the
total body fat and (b) the sites selected represent the average
thickness of the sub&shy;cu&shy;taneous adipose tissue.  In fact, the relationship
between sub&shy;cu&shy;taneous and internal fat is nonlinear and varies with body
weight, age, and disease state.  Very lean subjects have a smaller
proportion of body fat deposited sub&shy;cu&shy;taneously than do obese subjects,
and in malnourished persons there is probably a shift of fat storage
from sub&shy;cu&shy;taneous to deep visceral sites.  Variations in the
distri&shy;bution of sub&shy;cu&shy;taneous fat also occurs with age, sex, and ethnicity
or race

Increasingly, body compo&shy;sition is assessed by laboratory methods; these
are described in Chapter&nbsp;14.  Even laboratory methods are based on
certain assumptions that have been challenged in recent years.  For
example, until recently, densitometry, frequently using underwater
weighing, has been the gold standard reference method for the
deter&shy;mination of the per&shy;cent&shy;age of body fat.  The assumptions used in
densitometry are that the densities of the fat mass and fat-free mass
are constant at 0.90 and 1.10kg/L, respectively (Chapter&nbsp;11).
Several researchers have questioned the validity of using a constant
density of the fat-free mass for groups who vary in age, gender, levels
of body fatness, and race or ethnicity

Per&shy;cent&shy;age of body fat can also be deter&shy;mined

Fortunately, the advent of multicomponent

<h3 id="9.4">9.4 Inter&shy;pretation and
evaluation of anthro&shy;pometric data</h3>

Anthro&shy;pometric indices are derived from two or more
raw mea&shy;sure&shy;ments, as noted earlier.  Normally, it is these indices that
are interpreted and evaluated &mdash; not the raw mea&shy;sure&shy;ments.
Anthro&shy;pometric indices can be used at
both the individual and the population levels to assess
nutri&shy;tional status and to screen and assess a response during
inter&shy;ventions.  In addition, in populations, anthro&shy;pometry can be used
to identify the deter&shy;minants and
consequences of mal&shy;nu&shy;trition and for
nutri&shy;tional surveillance.  To achieve these objectives, knowledge of
factors that may modify or &ldquo;condition&rdquo;
the inter&shy;pretation of abnormal
anthro&shy;pometric indices is generally required.  These conditioning
factors are briefly discussed below,
together with anthropometric reference data and
methods to evaluate anthropometric
indices, including classification systems that identify
individuals and populations as &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; for mal&shy;nu&shy;trition.

<h3 id="9.4.1">9.4.1 Conditioning factors</h3>

 A variety of factors are known to modify or condition the inter&shy;pretation
of anthro&shy;pometric data and must be taken into account.  Some important
examples include age, birthweight, birth length, gesta&shy;tional age, sex,
parental stature, and feeding mode during infancy.  Maturation during
adolescence, prepregnancy weight, maternal
height, parity, smoking, pregnancy, and ethnicity
are major conditioning factors for adults

<span data-tippy-content="Physical status: the use and interpretation of anthropometry. Report of a WHO Expert Committee. (1995). World Health Organization technical report series, 854, 1–452.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8594834/"
target="right" >WHO, 1995</a>)</span>.
<p>
Information on some of these conditioning factors can be obtained by physical
examinations, questionnaires, or self-reports.  An accurate assessment
of age is especially critical for the derivation of many anthro&shy;pometric
indices used to identify abnormal anthro&shy;pometry, notably height-for-age
and weight-for-age. See:
<a href="https://www.infantchart.com/"
target="right" >WHO Child Growth Standards.</a>
<p>
Age is also important for categorizing the data into
the age groups recom&shy;mended by WHO for analysis and
inter&shy;pretation

see Chapter&nbsp;13 for details.
In more affluent countries, the assessment of age using birth certificates
is generally easy, but in some low-income countries, local calendars of
special events are often constructed to assist in identi&shy;fying the birth
date of a child.
<p>
Alternatively, for young children, age is sometimes
assessed by counting deciduous teeth.  This method is most appro&shy;priate
at the population level because of the wide variation among individuals
in the timing of deciduous eruption

  Assessment
of gesta&shy;tional age is especially critical for the inter&shy;pretation of
both size-for-age mea&shy;sure&shy;ments during infancy and the neuro&shy;develop&shy;mental
progress of preterm infants.  It is also essential for the management of
pregnancy and the treatment of new-born infants.
<p>
Several strategies are
available for estimating gesta&shy;tional age.  Prenatal measures of
gesta&shy;tional age include calculating the number of completed weeks since
the beginning of the last menstrual period, prenatal ultra&shy;sonography,
and clinical methods; they are all described in
Chapter&nbsp;10. In public health settings,
the definition of gesta&shy;tional age on the basis of the last
menstrual period is most frequently used, although it is
associated with several problems: errors may occur
because of irregular menses, bleeding early in pregnancy,
and incorrect recall by mothers. Prenatal ultra&shy;sonography
during the first or second trimester, although considered
the gold standard method for assessment of gesta&shy;tional
age, is not universally available, especially in low-income countries.
Further&shy;more, the quality of both the equipment used and the technical training varies.

information on maturation should also be collected in view of the marked
variation in the timing of the maturational changes during adolescence.
The best measure of maturity is bone age &mdash; often termed skeletal
maturation &mdash; because it can be obtained for both sexes over a wide age
range.  However, special equipment and expertise are required for the
assessment of bone age.  Hence, instead, surrogate measures of somatic
maturation are generally used in nutri&shy;tion surveys.  WHO

recom&shy;mends the use of two maturational events for each sex to assist in
interpreting anthro&shy;pometric data during adolescence:  one marker
signaling the beginning of the adolescent growth spurt in each sex, and
one indicating that the peak velocity for height and associated changes
have passed. In girls, the indicator that can be used to signal that the
adolescent growth spurt has begun is the start of breast development,
which precedes peak height velocity by about 1y.
The marker indicating that most of the adolescent growth
spurt has been completed is the attainment of menarche,
which begins a little more than 1y after peak height
velocity (Figure&nbsp;9.1).  In boys, the corresponding indicators
signaling the beginning and completion of the adolescent growth
spurt are adolescent changes in the penis,
characterizing G3, followed by the attainment of adult voice, respectively

<h3 id="9.4.2">9.4.2 Appro&shy;priate anthropometric reference data</h3>

In public health settings, appro&shy;priate anthro&shy;pometric reference data
facilitate international comparisons of anthro&shy;pometric
indices across populations and enable the proportion
of individuals with abnormal indices to be deter&shy;mined
relative to the reference population. Such comparisons
enable the extent and severity of mal&shy;nu&shy;trition in the study
group to be estimated. In surveillance studies, reference
data allow the evaluation of trends over time, as well as
the effectiveness of inter&shy;vention programs to be assessed.
Reference data can also be used in clinical settings
to monitor growth of individuals, detect abnormal
changes in growth, and assess response to treatment

The WHO recom&shy;mends the use of the WHO Child Growth Standards for
young children from birth to 5y for international use



<span data-tippy-content="WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group (2006). WHO Child Growth Standards based on length/height, weight and age. Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992). Supplement, 450, 76–85.">

in view of the small effect of ethnic and genetic differences on the growth of
infants and young children compared with the
environmental, nutri&shy;tional, and socio-economic effects,
some of which may persist across generations.
The WHO Child Growth Standard was developed
as a result of the technical and biological limitations
identified with the earlier NCHS/WHO growth reference

<span data-tippy-content="Garza, C., and de&nbsp;Onis M (1999). A new international growth reference for young children. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 70(1 Part 2), 169S–172S.">

target="right" >Garza and de&nbsp;Onis, 1999</a>)</span>.

A prescriptive approach
depicting physiological human growth under optimal conditions
was used for the new Child Growth Standards so they represent
how young children should grow, rather than as
a &ldquo;reference&rdquo; describing how children do grow.
To achieve this goal, a set of individual eligibility criteria
were developed: term singleton infants with non-smoking mothers,
a health status that did not constrain growth, and mothers who
were willing to follow current WHO feeding recom&shy;mendations.
The design combined a longitudinal study from birth to 24mos
with a cross-sectional study of children aged
<span class="n">18&ndash;71mos</span>
based on pooled data from 6 participating countries
(Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United
States)

Updated childhood growth charts have been prepared
by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) for U.S children for two age groups:
<span class="n">0&ndash;36mos</span> and
<span class="n">2&ndash;20y.</span>
These CDC&nbsp;2000 growth charts are based primarily on
physical measure&shy;ments taken during
five nationally represen&shy;tative surveys conducted between 1963 and 1994,
although some supplemental data were also used.
When creating these revised growth charts, two data sets were excluded:
growth data for very low birthweight infants (&lt;&nbsp;1500g)
whose growth differs from that of normal birth-weight infants,
and weight data for children &gt;&nbsp;6y who participated
in the NHANES&nbsp;III survey. The latter data were
excluded from both the revised weight and BMI growth
charts because their inclusion shifted the upper per&shy;cen&shy;tile curves.
Hence, the exclusion of these selected data resulted
in a modified growth reference that is not a purely
descriptive growth reference because it does not
contain represen&shy;tative national data for all variables

In practice, however, only a few countries
have local body compo&shy;sition reference
data.  In the absence of such local data,
WHO recom&shy;mend the use of the reference data
for mid-upper-arm circum&shy;ference (MUAC),
triceps and subscapular skinfolds based on the
data collected during the WHO MGRS on children age
<span class="n">0&ndash;5y.</span>

<p>
In clinical settings, abnormal changes in the rate of
growth of a child can be detected much earlier when
growth velocity charts, rather than distance growth charts,
are used; see Chapter&nbsp;13 for more details.
Growth velocity charts are based on longitudinal
studies during which the same child is measured serially,
and the growth rate calculated for each interval.
WHO has developed a set of growth velocity charts based
on the WHO MGRS described earlier for
international use; see de&nbsp;Onis et&nbsp;al.

Several different distance growth standards have been
compiled, depending on the specific deter&shy;minants of
growth. For example, the new international postnatal
growth standards should be used for preterm
infants

in view of the difference
in weight, length, and head circum&shy;ference between preterm
and full-term infants. More&shy;over, the time period over which these
differences extend varies with the growth mea&shy;sure&shy;ment.
Differences are significant until 18 mos for head circum&shy;ference,
until 24mos for weight-for-age, and up to 3.5y for length/height-for-age.

<h3 id="9.4.3">9.4.3 Methods of evaluating anthropometric indices</h3>

For studies of both individuals and populations, the anthro&shy;pometric
indices can be compared to the reference population using
per&shy;cen&shy;tiles or Z&#8209;scores derived from the distri&shy;bution
of the anthropometric reference data. A per&shy;cen&shy;tile refers to the position
of the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment value in relation to all the mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
for the reference population, ranked in order of magni&shy;tude.
A Z&#8209;score (or standard deviation score) measures
the deviation of the value for an individual from the median
value of the reference population, divided by the standard
deviation of the reference, as shown below:
\[\small \mbox{Z&#8209;score or SD score =  } \frac {\mbox {(observed value) &minus; (median reference value)}}{\mbox {(standard deviation of reference population)}}\]
In most industrialized countries, per&shy;cen&shy;tiles are used because
no errors are introduced if the data have a skewed distri&shy;bution.
Weight-for-age, weight-for-height, and many circumferential
and skinfold indices have skewed distri&shy;butions.
<p></p>
per&shy;cen&shy;tiles are not appro&shy;priate for use in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where
many children may fall below the lowest per&shy;cen&shy;tile.

</figcaption>
</figure>
In these settings Z&#8209;scores should be used
because they can be calculated accurately beyond the
limits of the original reference data. Hence, individuals
with indices below the extreme per&shy;cen&shy;tiles of the
reference data can then be classified accurately.
For more discussion of per&shy;cen&shy;tiles and Z&#8209;scores, see Chapter&nbsp;13.

Both per&shy;cen&shy;tiles and Z&#8209;scores based on the WHO
Child Growth Standards (0-5y) and the WHO
Growth Reference for school-aged children and
adolescents (5-19y) can be readily calculated
in population studies using the WHO software
program: WHO AnthroPlus (2009). Alternatively, for
individuals in clinical settings, the per&shy;cen&shy;tile or
Z&#8209;score range within which the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of an
individual falls can be read from sex-specific
charts or tables of the appro&shy;priate reference data, as shown in
<a href="#figure9.3">Figure&nbsp;9.3</a>.

is an example of the first method summarized
in Box&nbsp;9.4. Here the frequency distri&shy;bution of the
Z&#8209;scores for height-for-age children from the Indian
National Family Health Survey (2005-2006) are compared
with the corresponding reference distri&shy;bution of height-for-age
Z&#8209;scores for the WHO Child Growth Standards.
The figure high&shy;lights that nearly all the children surveyed
were affected by some degree of linear growth retardation
and would benefit from an inter&shy;vention; this approach is
 termed a &ldquo;population approach to targeting&rdquo;.
 <p>
Summary statistics can also be used when
anthro&shy;pometric indices are expressed as Z&#8209;scores
in population studies. In the example given in Figure&nbsp;9.4,
the calculated mean height-for-age Z&#8209;score (-1.83)
for the children was markedly lower than zero &mdash;
the expected value for the reference distri&shy;bution.
This statistic alone indicates
that the entire distri&shy;bution has shifted downward,
suggesting that most, if not all of the individuals,
are affected by linear growth retardation, as was clear
from the frequency distri&shy;bution of the height-for-age
Z&#8209;scores compared
with the corresponding reference distri&shy;bution depicted, in Figure&nbsp;9.4.
<p>
Note, summary statistics
cannot be calculated in this way for data from a population
expressed in terms of per&shy;cen&shy;tiles which are often not normally distributed.

However, even if the populations have the
same mean Z&#8209;score, their SDs may differ, with the population
with the larger SD having a greater proportion
below the reference limit or cutoff point, as shown in
(<a href="#figure9.5">Figure&nbsp;9.5</a>).
Here, the growth reference is not being used
for comparative purposes as shown in Figure&nbsp;9.4.

<p>
The third method itemized in Box&nbsp;9.4 involves
calculating the per&shy;cent&shy;age of individuals with
anthro&shy;pometric indices below or above
predeter&shy;mined reference limits or cutoff points.
When used in this way, the anthro&shy;pometric index
and its associated reference limit or cutoff point
are termed an &ldquo;indicator&rdquo; as described earlier.
This approach is used to classify individuals as &ldquo;at risk&rdquo;
to mal&shy;nu&shy;trition and is
used by governments and International Agencies (e.g., WHO and UNICEF)
to generate prevalence estimates of malnutrition
for information and comparisons across countries,
as well as for advocacy. The approach is described
in more detail below.

<h3 id="9.4.4">9.4.4 Classification systems</h3>

Classification systems are used in both clinical
settings and in public health. All use at least one
anthro&shy;pometric mea&shy;sure&shy;ment and one or more
reference limit derived from appro&shy;priate reference
data (i.e., indicator) to classify at risk individuals.
Alternatively, cut-off points are used.  In practice,
classification schemes are not perfect, some
misclassification will always occur so that some
individuals identified as &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; to
mal&shy;nu&shy;trition will not be truly malnourished (false positives),
and others classified as &ldquo;not at risk&rdquo; to
mal&shy;nu&shy;trition will in fact be malnourished (false negatives).
Misclassification arises because there is always
biological variation among individuals (and hence in
the normal levels defined by the
mea&shy;sure&shy;ment)

 see Chapter&nbsp;13 for more details.
<p>
Reference limits for anthro&shy;pometric indices are
derived from a reference distri&shy;bution and can
be expressed in terms of Z&#8209;scores or per&shy;cen&shy;tiles.
In low income countries reference limits defined by
Z&#8209;scores are frequently applied, with scores
below &minus;2&nbsp;or above &plus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;scores
of the WHO Child Growth Standard or WHO Growth Reference
used to designate individuals with either
unusually low or unusually high anthro&shy;pometric
indices

<span data-tippy-content="Physical status: the use and interpretation of anthropometry. Report of a WHO Expert Committee. (1995). World Health Organization technical report series, 854, 1–452.">

target="right" >WHO, 1995</a>)</span>.

This approach is used
because statistically 95% of the international reference
population fall within the central range assumed to
be &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;.
Therore, theoretically,
the proportion of children with a Z&#8209;score less
than &minus;2&nbsp;or  greater than&nbsp;&plus;2 in a
study population should be &asymp;&nbsp;2.3%.
Clearly, if the proportion in the study population
with such low or high Z&#8209;scores is significantly
greater than this, then the study population is
seriously affected.  The WHO uses the
below &minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;scores of the WHO
reference median for weight-for-age, length/height-for-age,
or weight-for-height to classify children as under&shy;weight,
stunted, or wasted, respectively.
<p>
In industrialized countries,
the per&shy;cen&shy;tiles commonly used for designating
individuals as &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; to mal&shy;nu&shy;trition
are either below the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> and
above the 97<sup>th</sup> or 95<sup>th</sup> per&shy;cen&shy;tiles.
The limits chosen depend on the reference data used: see Chapter&nbsp;13 for more details.
<p>
There is nothing immutable about a reference
limit at &minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;score, despite their
use by countries and agencies to generate prevalence
estimates, most notably for stunting and wasting.
As a consequence, attempts have been made to
establish  &ldquo;cutoffs&rdquo; for some
anthropometric indicators to improve the ability
to discriminate between children who are
malnourished and those who are &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;.
These cutoffs have been
established by a review of the anthro&shy;pometric
characteristics of individuals with either clinically
moderate or severe mal&shy;nu&shy;trition or who subsequently die.
However, many other characteristics of individuals such
as age, sex, life-stage, race/ethnicity, genetics, and
morbidity or nutri&shy;tional status may affect the relationship under study

Hence, in practice, defining cutoffs is difficult because
the relationship between the indices and the biological
factors cannot be generalized from one region to another

Consequently, in some studies universal cutoff points are used,
whereas in others the methods used to identify
the cutoff points applied are not always well documented.
<p>
As an example in a study of low BMI and morbidity
in Pakistan, a reported a cutoff of &lt;&nbsp;18.5 was
associated with higher morbidity, whereas in Calcutta
it was &lt;&nbsp;16.0

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are often
used to deter&shy;mine cutoff points. This is a graphical method
of comparing indices and portraying the trade-offs that
occur in the sensitivity and specificity of a mea&shy;sure&shy;ment
or index when the cutoffs are altered.
To use this approach, a spectrum of cutoffs over the
observed range of the indicator results is used, and the
sensitivity and specificity for each cutoff calculated.
Next, the sensitivity (or true-positive) rate is plotted on the
vertical axis against the true negative rate (1&minus;specificity)
on the horizontal axis for each cutoff point, as shown in
(<a href="#figure9.6">Figure&nbsp;9.6</a>).

The closer the curve follows the left-hand of the ROC space,
the more accurate is the cutoff under study in
distinguishing the health or nutri&shy;tional status condition
under investigation from optimal status. The optimal
ROC curve is the line connecting the points highest and farthest
to the left of the upper corner. The closer the curve comes
to the 45&deg; diagonal of the ROC space,
the less accurate the indicator cutoffs

<p></p>
The choice of the cutoff may vary depending on the circumstances.
When resources are scarce, a low cutoff point may be selected.
As a consequence, the sensitivity decreases, which mean that
more truly malnourished children are missed. However, at the
same time, the specificity increases, which means that
fewer well-nourished children are misdiagnosed as malnourished.
Conversely, when resources are generous, the cutoff
can be high, because it does not matter if some children receive
treatment when they do not need it.   The inverse relationship
between sensitivity and specificity and relative risk of mortality
associated with various values for MUAC in children

More details of the inter-relationships between these variables is given in Chapter&nbsp;1.
<p>
Unfortunately, because sensitivity and specificity data
for the anthro&shy;pometric indices selected are usually
not known for the population under study, the data
required to plot ROC curves are
often obtained elsewhere, even though the values
may not be appro&shy;priate for the population under
study because of the many factors known to
influence cutoff values, as noted earlier; see Chapter&nbsp;13
for more details. Ultimately the choice of an
index and an associated cutoff point (i.e., an indicator)
depends on the resources available and the purpose for which it is being used.
The latter can range from screening for disease or monitoring
to detect changes in prevalence of mal&shy;nu&shy;trition etc.
For more discussion on the selection of anthro&shy;pometric
 indicators, see Brownie et&nbsp;al.

Screening tools to identify those who are malnourished
in clinical or public health settings can be based
on single or multiple mea&shy;sure&shy;ments and associated
reference limits or cutoff points.
An example of a screening tool used in clinical settings is  the
Mal&shy;nu&shy;trition Universal Screening Tool (MUST),
widely used to identify adults who are at risk
of undernutri&shy;tion or obesity (See Chapter&nbsp;27).
MUST is based on height and weight mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
from which both a BMI score (from 3 cutoffs)
assessed via a chart and weight loss in previous
<span class="n">3&ndash;6mos,</span>
can be derived, followed by establishing acute disease
effect and score. From the sum of the three scores,
the overall risk of mal&shy;nu&shy;trition is calculated,
with management guidelines provided according to the level
of risk (low; medium; high).  More details are available:
<a href="https://www.bapen.org.uk/pdfs/must/must-full.pdf"
target="right" >Mal&shy;nu&shy;trition Universal Screening Tool </a>.
<p>
In public health emergencies, a screening tool
based on a single mea&shy;sure&shy;ment (i.e., MUAC)
and associated cutoff (i.e., &lt;&nbsp;115mm)
is often used to identify severe acute mal&shy;nu&shy;trition (SAM)
in children <span class="n">6&ndash;60mos.</span>   This MUAC cutoff was chosen
because children with a MUAC &lt;&nbsp;115mm were
observed to have a highly elevated risk of death compared to those with a
MUAC &gt;&nbsp;115mm

For defining over&shy;weight
and obesity in children and adolescents,
WHO recom&shy;mends the use of BMI-for-age
Z&#8209;scores and reference limits based on Z&#8209;scores.
For children <span class="n">(0&ndash;5y),</span> a Z&#8209;score for BMI-for-age
above&nbsp;&plus;1 is described as being &ldquo;at risk
of over&shy;weight&rdquo;, above&nbsp;&plus;2 as &ldquo;over&shy;weight&rdquo;,
and above&nbsp;&plus;3 as &ldquo;obese&rdquo;
based on the WHO Child Growth Standard. For
children <span class="n">5&ndash;19y,</span>
BMI-for-age Z&#8209;scores above&nbsp;&plus;1
and above&nbsp;&plus;2 based on the WHO 2007
growth reference data are recom&shy;mended

Increasingly, it is recognized that in low-income countries,
multiple anthropometric deficits may occur
simultaneously in children and amplify their
risk of morbidity and mortality. Consequently, a composite index of anthropometric
failure (CIAF) has been developed, and
is described in Chapter&nbsp;13.

In public health, screening tools are also used to map
countries according to levels of severity of

The number of countries in different threshold
categories for wasting, over&shy;weight, and stunting,
also shown in
(<a href="#table9.6">Table&nbsp;9.6</a>),
is based on data from 134&nbsp;countries.
Comparison of the prevalence estimates
for each anthro&shy;pometric indicator can trigger
countries to identify the most appro&shy;priate
inter&shy;vention program to
achieve &ldquo;low&rdquo; or &ldquo;very low&rdquo; prevalence thresholds.
