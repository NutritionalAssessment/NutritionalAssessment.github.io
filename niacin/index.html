<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

The term "niacin" refers to three compounds:
nico&shy;tin&shy;amide, nico&shy;tinic acid, and nico&shy;tin&shy;amide ribose.  They
are precursors of nico&shy;tin&shy;amide adenine dinucleo&shy;tide (NAD)
and nico&shy;tin&shy;amide adenine dinucleo&shy;tide phosphate (NADP),
both of which function in a variety of oxidation and
reduction reactions and are associated with both cata&shy;bolic
and anabolic processes.  Pellagra, a disease of the "4Ds"
(diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death) is the syndrome
of niacin deficiency.  Although rare, outbreaks of pellagra
still occur when diets are based on maize (without
nixtamalization), a cereal low in bioavailable niacin.
Secondary niacin deficiency may also develop in diseases
that inter&shy;fere with absorp&shy;tion of niacin or tryp&shy;to&shy;phan (a
precursor of niacin) (e.g., chronic colitis, liver cirrhosis)
or reduce the con&shy;ver&shy;sion of tryp&shy;to&shy;phan to niacin (e.g.,
chronic alcoholism, prolonged isoniazid treat&shy;ment for
tuberculosis).  Rich food sources of niacin include meat,
poultry, and fish, followed by dairy products and enriched
or fortified cereals.  Coffee is also a good source of
niacin.  Absorption of niacin from food ranges from about 23% to
70% and is lowest from cereals and highest from animal
products.  Certain food preparation and pro&shy;ces&shy;sing practices
may influence the content and bio&shy;avail&shy;ability of niacin in
food.  Intakes and requirements for niacin are expressed as
niacin equivalents (NEs) to consider the contribution of
tryp&shy;to&shy;phan to niacin (i.e., 60mg tryp&shy;to&shy;phan yields 1mg
niacin).  Dietary reference values for niacin are set as NE
per day, or alternatively expressed as mg NE/MJ or mg
NE/1000 kcal based on the relationship between the
requirements for niacin ad energy.  Niacin toxicity may
occur when large pharmacological doses of niacin are taken
to prevent or treat metabolic diseases such as dyslipidemia.
Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) are based on dermal
vasodilative flushing.
<p></p>
At present, the best biomarker of niacin status is the
measure&shy;ment of two urinary meta&shy;bolites:  N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide
and N'&#8209;methyl-2-pyridine-5-carbox&shy;amide
(2&#8209;pyridone) using HPLC.  Sampling strategies employed
include 24h urines with results expressed as  concen&shy;trations
of individual meta&shy;bolites (mg/d), or random spot urines when
the ratio (2&#8209;pyridone to N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide), or
 concen&shy;trations relative to creatinine (mg/g creatinine) are
used.  Interpretive criteria for adults are available for
urinary excretion of these niacin meta&shy;bolites expressed
relative to creatinine and as the ratio (2&#8209;pyridone / N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide).
WHO has developed
provisional criteria for the severity of public health
problem of niacin deficiency.  Concentrations of the
co-enzyme NAD in erythro&shy;cytes (but not whole blood) or the
ratio of erythro&shy;cyte NAD to NADP (called niacin index) are
said to be sensitive to short-term changes in niacin intake,
even in the absence of clinical signs of deficiency.  Hence,
they may serve as a sensitive and reliable functional
biomarker for risk of niacin deficiency.  With the
development of a rapid LC-MS/MS method for their analysis,
further investigation of erythro&shy;cyte NAD and NADP
 concen&shy;trations as biomarkers of niacin status is warranted.

<h3 id="20c.1">20c.1  Niacin - Introduction</h3>

Niacin (also known as "vitamin&nbsp;B3") is the term used to
describe a group of compounds with the biological activity
of the vitamin.  They include nico&shy;tinic acid (also known as
niacin) composed of a pyrimidine ring bound to a carboxylic
group (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), nico&shy;tin&shy;amide (also known
as niacinamide) composed of a pyrimidine ring bound to a
carbox&shy;amide group (pyridine-3-carbox&shy;amide), and
nico&shy;tin&shy;amide riboside.  The third compound, nico&shy;tin&shy;amide
riboside has been identified more recently and is a
pyridine-nucleoside form of vitamin&nbsp;B3 consisting of
nico&shy;tin&shy;amide with a beta-D-ribofuranosyl moiety at the
1&#8209;position

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32486488"
target="right" >Mehmel et al., 2020</a>). </span>

All three compounds have
similar but not identical properties and are precursors of
nico&shy;tin&shy;amide adenine dinucleo&shy;tide (NAD) and its
phos&shy;phory&shy;lated derivative, nico&shy;tin&shy;amide adenine dinucleo&shy;tide
phosphate (NADP).  The structures of nico&shy;tinic acid,
nico&shy;tin&shy;amide, and nico&shy;tin&shy;amide riboside are shown in

Most of the niacin in food is present as NAD and NADP; very
little exists as free forms of niacin

Prior to absorp&shy;tion, these two comp&shy;nents
must first be hydro&shy;lyzed to free nico&shy;tin&shy;amide by
phos&shy;phatases and NAD glyco&shy;hydro&shy;lases in the small intestine,
the major site of absorp&shy;tion.  At
low intakes, absorp&shy;tion into the intestinal cell is by
sodium-dependent, carrier-mediated diffusion, but at higher
intakes, passive diffusion predom&shy;inates

Once absorbed, free nico&shy;tin&shy;amide is trans&shy;ported to
all tissues for the synthesis of the two coen&shy;zymes NAD and
NADP within the cells.  In general, concentrations of intra&shy;cellular
of NAD are higher than NADP.  All tissues of
the body can syn&shy;the&shy;size NAD and NADP, although
concentrations are greatest in the liver where some storage
may occur.  Some niacin can be syn&shy;the&shy;sized by colonic
bacteria in the large intestine

NAD exists in two forms:  NAD+ (oxidized) and NADH (reduced),
while NADP exists as NADP+ (oxidized) and NADPH (reduced).
<p></p>
NAD+ can be syn&shy;the&shy;sized within the cell from nico&shy;tinic acid,
nico&shy;tin&shy;amide, nico&shy;tin&shy;amide riboside, and tryp&shy;to&shy;phan by three
path&shy;ways, all of which require the enzyme nico&shy;tin&shy;amide
mono&shy;nucleotide phosphoribosyl&shy;transferase (NMNAT).  The three
path&shy;ways include the con&shy;ver&shy;sion of tryp&shy;to&shy;phan to NAD via the
<i>de novo</i> NAD synthesis path&shy;way, the Preiss-Handler path&shy;way
from nico&shy;tinic acid, comprising three individual
metabolic conversions, and the salvage path&shy;way involving the
NAD+ precursors nico&shy;tin&shy;amide or nico&shy;tin&shy;amide riboside.  Of
the three, the salvage path&shy;way is the domi&shy;nant one; for more
details on these synthetic path&shy;ways see Kirkland & Meyer-Ficca

<span data-tippy-content="Kirkland, J. B., & Meyer-Ficca, M. L. (2018). 
Niacin. Advances in food and nutrition research, 83, 83–149.">

target="right" >2018</a>). </span>

<p></p>
NAD+ primarily participates in cata&shy;bolic reactions and is an
essential substrate for the activity of three classes of
NAD+ -consuming enzymes:  (i) sirtuins (SIRTs), (ii)
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), and (iii) cyclic
ADP-ribose (cADPr) synthases.  These NAD+-consuming enzymes
cleave NAD+, resulting in an ongoing loss of NAD+ during
which nico&shy;tin&shy;amide is produced as a reaction by-product.
Because loss of NAD+ cannot be compen&shy;sated by intake of NAD
from the diet, nico&shy;tin&shy;amide is recycled into NAD+ via the
salvage path&shy;way.  This path&shy;way involves the activity of
NAMPT and nico&shy;tin&shy;amide mono&shy;nucleotide adenylyl&shy;transferase (NMNAT 1&#8209;3).
Hence, activity of these enzymes has a larger effect on NAD
concen&shy;trations than nico&shy;tin&shy;amide or dietary intakes of
niacin.  For more details on the action of these enzymes see
Xiao et&nbsp;al.

NAD+ can be converted to NAD+phosphate (NADP+) by the
activity of NAD+ kinase.  NAD(H) can also be utilized as a
substrate during which NADPH is produced instead of NADP+, a
process involving yet another NAD+-consuming process.
During meta&shy;bolism both NAD+ and the phos&shy;phoryl&shy;ated form
NAD(P)+ undergo redox reactions and generate two redox
couples NAD+ / NAD(H) and NAD(P)+ / NAD(P)H.  The NAD+ / NAD(H)
redox couple participates in about 400 reactions, predominately
in cata&shy;bolic meta&shy;bolism, and regulates cellular energy
meta&shy;bolism, that is glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative
phos&shy;phoryl&shy;ation.  By contrast, the NADP+ / NAD(P)H pool
participates in about 30 reactions, mainly in anabolic
meta&shy;bolism, and supports the biosynthesis of fatty acids and
nucleic acids and is involved in maintaining redox balance.
For a review of the cata&shy;bolic processes and anabolic
processes involving NAD+ and NAD(P)+, see Hrubsa et&nbsp;al.

More research is required to
better under&shy;stand the cellular functions of NAD(H) and
NADP(H) and how loss of redox homeostasis affects energy
meta&shy;bolism.
<p></p>
In addition to its redox roles, NAD+ is also an essential
cofactor for important non-redox signaling path&shy;ways, thus
regulating biological functions, including gene expres&shy;sion,
cell cycle progres&shy;sion, DNA repair and cell death.  For more
details on the role of NAD in the central nervous system,

The major path&shy;way of catabolism of nico&shy;tinic acid and
nico&shy;tin&shy;amide is by methyl&shy;ation in the liver to
N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide (NMN) and subsequent oxidation to
N&#8209;methyl-2&#8209;pyridone-carbox&shy;amide (2&#8209;pyridone) and
N'&#8209;methyl-4&#8209;pyridone-5-carbox&shy;amide (4&#8209;pyridone).  Under normal
conditions, 20&#8209;35% and 45&#8209;60% of niacin is excreted as
N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide (NMN) and 2&#8209;pyridone respectively, although the
amount varies depending on niacin and tryp&shy;to&shy;phan intake

Physiological amounts of both nico&shy;tinic acid and
nico&shy;tin&shy;amide prevent the classical signs of niacin
deficiency (see section below).  However, certain niacin
compounds also have pharmacological properties.  At

decrease total cholesterol, LDL&nbsp;cholesterol, and
triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C)

<h3 id="20c.1.2">20c.1.2  Deficiency of niacin in humans</h3>

Pellagra is the characteristic syndrome of severe niacin
deficiency and its dietary precursor tryp&shy;to&shy;phan.  Pellagra
is known as the disease of the "4Ds" (diarrhea,
dermatitis, and dementia, culmin&shy;ating in death).  Early
symptoms include diarrhea resulting from intestinal
inflam&shy;mation. accom&shy;panied by anorexia, nausea, and abdominal
pain.  Later, dermatitis develops in sun-exposed skin such
as dorsal parts of hands, feet, cheeks, forehead, and
sun-exposed regions of the neck

These
signs arise from deficits in poly (ADP-ribose) polym&shy;erase
activity in response to UV radiation-induced DNA damage.

An L-shaped relationship between dietary niacin
intake and migraine was reported, with the risk decreasing
with increasing dietary niacin consumption in those with a
dietary niacin intake of &lt;21.0mg/d.  However, there was no
association between dietary niacin consumption and migraine
when the daily niacin intake was &gt;21.0mg/d, indicating
that the risk of migraine no longer decreases with
increasing dietary niacin intake

Pellagra is often a problem in countries where maize and
millet jowar (<i>Sorghum vulgare</i>) are dietary staples.  The
bio&shy;avail&shy;ability of niacin in maize is poor (only about 30%)
because most of the niacin is present in two forms:
niacytin and niacino&shy;genes.  Niacytin consists of nicotinic
acid esterified to poly&shy;saccharides, whereas niacino&shy;genes are
bound to poly&shy;peptides and glyco&shy;peptides; both forms are
unavailable for absorp&shy;tion by intestinal enzymes.  Maize is
also particularly low in tryp&shy;to&shy;phan, a precursor of NAD

In contrast, millet jowar contains suitable amounts
of tryp&shy;to&shy;phan, but excessive amounts of leucine which
inter&shy;fere with the con&shy;ver&shy;sion of tryp&shy;to&shy;phan to niacin.  The
mechanism is uncertain.  Excess leucine may disrupt the
availability or utilization of riboflavin and vitamin&nbsp;B6,
micronutrients required in the synthesis of niacin from
tryp&shy;to&shy;phan

Prolonged treat&shy;ment of tuberculosis with the drug isoniazid
also reduces the con&shy;ver&shy;sion of tryp&shy;to&shy;phan to niacin by

Malawi, an increased risk of pellagra has been associated
with mass scale-up of isoniazid use for the preventive

There are several known niacin-responsive genetic diseases
which disrupt NAD synthesis, causing a deficiency of NAD.
In some, the NAD disruption arises from the inability to
trans&shy;port tryp&shy;to&shy;phan into cells due to mutation in a
tryp&shy;to&shy;phan trans&shy;porter (i.e, in Hartnup disease) leading to
pellagra, and eventually death unless treated early with niacin

Most of the niacin in food is present as a component of NAD
or NADP as noted earlier; very little exists as free forms
of niacin, with the exception of liver and beans.  Rich food
sources of niacin include meat (especially liver), poultry,
and fish followed by dairy products, oilseeds, some cereals
(especially when enriched or fortified with niacin), legumes
(including peanuts) and baker's yeast

Certain food preparation and pro&shy;ces&shy;sing
methods can influence the content and bio&shy;avail&shy;ability of
niacin in food.  Milling of cereals reduces their niacin
content.  Treat&shy;ment of cereals with alkali (e.g., lime
water), baking with alkaline baking powders, and roasting
whole grain maize, all increase niacin bio&shy;avail&shy;ability by
releasing the bound forms of niacin.  The thermo-alkaline
pro&shy;ces&shy;sing of maize kernels termed "nix&shy;tamaliz&shy;ation" and
practiced in Latin America, is responsible, at least in part
for the very low preval&shy;ence of pellagra in the region

Niacin can be derived from the amino acid L-tryp&shy;to&shy;phan, a
precursor of niacin, so intakes are usually expressed in
terms of niacin equivalents (NE).  About 60mg of tryp&shy;to&shy;phan
yields 1mg niacin following digestion and absorp&shy;tion.
However, the con&shy;ver&shy;sion rate varies widely (30%) between
individuals and tends to increase with increased tryp&shy;to&shy;phan
consumption.  The most common sources of tryp&shy;to&shy;phan in U.S
diets are high protein foods such as fish, chicken, and
milk, as well as bananas, chocolate, and peanuts

<h3 id="20c.1.4">20c.1.4  Effects of high intakes of niacin</h3>

Niacin toxicity may occur when large pharmacological doses
of different forms of niacin, especially nico&shy;tinic acid, are
taken to prevent or treat some metabolic diseases, as noted
earlier.  For example, nico&shy;tinic acid is used in high doses
(>1000mg/d) to treat hyper&shy;lipidemia but is sometimes
accom&shy;panied by side effects.  Of these, facial flushing
caused by prostaglandin D2-mediated vaso&shy;di&shy;latation of small
sub&shy;cutaneous blood vessels, may occur, and has even been
reported at doses of nico&shy;tinic acid below 50mg/d

<h3 id="20c.2">20c.2  Indices of niacin status</h3>

More recent research has focused on the effects of
supra&shy;physio&shy;logical doses of niacin compounds and their
potential health benefits.  Fort&shy;ifi&shy;cation of cereals with
multiple micro&shy;nutrients, including niacin, has been
accom&shy;panied by a reduction in the preval&shy;ence of pellagra in
low- and middle income countries and may account for the
lack of research on biomarkers of status and function for
niacin.  The tests available today reflect only recent
dietary intakes of niacin and there&shy;fore may not identify all
persons at risk to deficiency.

deficiency of niacin and/or tryp&shy;to&shy;phan.  However, as
simpler, and more rapid methods for measuring NAD and NADP
in erythro&shy;cytes become available in the future,
inves&shy;tiga&shy;tions of their use as indices of niacin status may
increase.  The current tests based on niacin meta&shy;bolites in

and N'&#8209;methyl-2-pyridone-5-carbox&shy;amide (2&#8209;pyridone) being the major end products of
niacin meta&shy;bolism.  These products are derived from either

analyzed both N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide and 2&#8209;pyridone levels simultaneously
in spot urine samples collected from two healthy
subjects over consec&shy;utive days. In the early morning of each day, 
an overnight fasting urine sample was collected. In addition, on day&nbsp;4, 
non-fasting urine samples were collected at 3h intervals over 9h from each subject. 
Use of vitamin supplements by each subject was recorded.
Their preliminary findings suggest that the use of
fasting, early morning urine samples for assessing niacin
status has potential, and the advantage of reducing
the impact of recent dietary intake and thus more indicative
of longer-term niacin status.  They also noted that
expression of the meta&shy;bolites relative to creatinine in the
fasting spot urine samples yielded more stable results.
Never&shy;the&shy;less, they caution use of this expression when
applied to individuals with protein malnutrition and thus
reduced creatinine output.  In such circumstances, use of
the urinary meta&shy;bolite / creatinine ratio is inappro&shy;priate
because the resultant ratio will be suggestive of a higher
niacin status

(2&#8209;pyridone) and N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide &mdash; collected from both
healthy individuals (n=2) and from patients diagnosed with
pellagra (n=34).  In this study, results were expressed as
the concentration of the meta&shy;bolites relative to creatinine
to provide the most stable measure&shy;ment of status.  When
expressed in this way, individuals with clinical pellagra
had lower  concen&shy;trations of the two urinary meta&shy;bolites,
which rose markedly following treat&shy;ment with a nico&shy;tin&shy;amide
supplement.  These findings indicate that the use of spot
urine sample 2&#8209;pyridone and N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide
 concen&shy;trations, relative to creatinine, are a sensitive and
specific measure of severe deficiency.
<p></p>
Based on earlier research, a ratio of 2&#8209;pyridone to
N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide has been proposed as a convenient
alternative index of niacin status, independent of age and
creatinine excretion, and applicable to casual urine samples

However, the use of this
ratio, has been challenged.  Although useful for detecting
severe niacin deficiency accom&shy;panied by pellagra, the ratio
appears less useful in less severe deficiency states.  For
example, in the experimental depletion-repletion study in
adult males

the ratio of 2&#8209;pyridone /
N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide in urine was not as good a measure of
the low (6.1mg NE/d intake) as the individual meta&shy;bolite
excretions and was not sensitive to the intake of 10.1mg NE/d
(see Table 20.10).  Hence, the ratio appears insensitive to
marginal intakes of niacin.  Moreover, some investigators
suggest that excretion of both N'&#8209;methyl&shy;nico&shy;tin&shy;amide and
2&#8209;pyridone in the urine is strongly dependent on the level
of protein intake, so that the ratio may be a measure of
protein adequacy and not niacin status

In view of these uncertainties, the use of

urinary changes in 2&#8209;pyridone were more responsive to niacin

The  concen&shy;trations of niacin compounds and niacin
meta&shy;bolites in the plasma, erythro&shy;cytes, and leukocytes have
been studied as potential measures of niacin nutriture.
Results have been inconsistent.  Niacin circulates in the
plasma as nico&shy;tin&shy;amide and nico&shy;tinic acid, although
nico&shy;tin&shy;amide is the major form.  These levels in plasma are
low and reflect dietary intake rather than body stores:
they do not appear to be very useful measures of niacin
status

The co-enzymes NAD and NADP are the active anabolic products
of niacin and thus theoretically should provide a more
direct measure of functional niacin status.  However, in a
study in Angola where niacin deficiency is endemic

In contrast, experimental niacin depletion - repletion
studies have shown that erythro&shy;cyte  concen&shy;trations of NAD
(but not NADP) are sensitive to short-term changes in niacin
intake, even in the absence of clinical signs of deficiency.
In the depletion-repletion study in young men

Based on these results, erythro&shy;cyte NAD levels
may serve as a sensitive and reliable biomarker for risk of
niacin deficiency.
<p></p>
The ratio of erythro&shy;cyte NAD to NADP (called niacin index)
is sometimes used as a measure of niacin status, as NADP
content in blood remains relatively unchanged even when
low-niacin intakes cause a fall in NAD  concen&shy;trations, as
shown in Figure 20c.3.  The ratio of erythro&shy;cyte NAD to NADP
of &lt;1.0 has been set as an interpretive criterion to
identify individuals at risk of niacin deficiency

The method has a simple, optimized

as well as for skeletal muscle and cerebrospinal fluid.  The
method utilizes an Accucore HILIC column with a linear
gradient with a total run time of 14min, less than half the
run time of most other available methods.  In addition, the
sample preparation does not require drying steps or speed
