<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

Vitamin&nbsp;C (ascorbic acid) is involved in a
variety of biological processes, acting primarily as an
electron donating enzyme cofactor and reducing agent
(antioxidant).  Clinical deficiency of vitamin&nbsp;C results in
scurvy, a relatively rare disease in high-income countries.
Nevertheless, moderate vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency (hypovitaminosis&nbsp;C)
has been described in selected vulnerable groups such as the
institutionalized elderly, with gingival inflammation and
fatigue appearing to be the most sensitive clinical markers
for moderate vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency. Excess intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C may
produce osmotic diarrhea in some people, and although
oxaluria has been reported, this mea&shy;sure&shy;ment is prone to errors in the
preparative or investigative procedure.
There are currently no reliable functional
indices of vitamin&nbsp;C nutriture.  Static biochemical indices
such as plasma or leukocyte ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations are
most frequently used.  The former reflect recent dietary
intake within a limited range (30&ndash;80mg/d).  Plasma ascorbic
acid concen&shy;trations increase linearly with dietary intake
but only up to a plateau of about 70&micro;mol/L, and thus are
unsuitable for detecting excessive intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C. A
number of non-nutritional factors, including sex, body
weight, smoking, and severe infection, affect plasma
ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations. Plasma concen&shy;trations
are a more reliable marker of vitamin&nbsp;C status than dietary
intake assessments.  Urinary excretion of vitamin&nbsp;C occurs
when the renal reabsorp&shy;tion threshold has been reached and
plasma &ldquo;saturation&rdquo; occurs (between about 60 and 70&micro;mol/L).
Urinary excretion is influenced by recent dietary intake.
Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of this test is
low, and 24h urine samples are generally required.
Leukocyte ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations are considered a
relatively reliable index of tissue ascorbic acid stores in
healthy people; they are less responsive than plasma to
short-term fluctuations in vitamin&nbsp;C intakes, but their
assay is difficult and requires a larger blood sample.
Furthermore, leukocyte ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations may not
be a reliable marker of vitamin&nbsp;C status in some conditions,
such as severe infection.  The body pool size of vitamin&nbsp;C
has been estimated using isotope dilution techniques.  More
research is needed to identify useful functional tests of
vitamin&nbsp;C status.

<h2 id="19.1">19.1 Vitamin&nbsp;C</h2>

For centuries, the consumption of citrus
fruit has been associated with the prevention of the vitamin&nbsp;C
deficiency disease scurvy, but it was not until 1932 that
the active com&shy;pound was isolated
<span data-tippy-content="King, C. G., & Waugh, W. A. (1932). THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF VITAMIN C. Science (New York, N.Y.), 75(1944), 357&ndash;358.">

A year later, ascorbic
acid was charac&shy;terized and became the first vitamin to be
chemically syn&shy;thesized.  Humans are unable to synthesize
vitamin&nbsp;C <i>in vivo</i> from glucose due to random genetic
mutations, which occurred at an early stage in our
evolution, and have resulted in loss of the terminal enzyme
in the biosynthetic pathway, L&#8209;gulono&shy;lactone oxidase

The term &ldquo;vitamin&nbsp;C&rdquo; is used here to
embrace both L&#8209;ascorbic acid and its
oxidised form, L&#8209;dehydro&shy;ascorbic acid; both have
approx&shy;imately equal vitamin&nbsp;C activity as dehydro&shy;ascorbic
acid can be readily reduced back to the biologically active
ascorbic acid in the body.  Ascorbic acid is the enolic form
of an &alpha;&#8209;keto&shy;lactone
(2,3-didehydro-threo-hexano-1,4-lactone), which in
solution can be oxidized to the diketo form—
dehydro-L&#8209;ascorbic acid; their structures are shown in

Under physiological conditions, vitamin&nbsp;C is
present pre&shy;dom&shy;inantly as the mono-anion, ascor&shy;bate.

<h3 id="19.2">19.2 Functions of Vitamin&nbsp;C</h3>

Ascorbic acid acts as an electron donating cofactor for a family of
bio&shy;syn&shy;thetic and regulatory metallo&shy;enzymes that carry out
important hydroxy&shy;lation reactions

These include copper-containing mono-oxygenases and iron-containing
dioxy&shy;genases.  Of the latter, the most well-known
is hydroxy&shy;lation of proline and lysine residues during
synthesis of collagen, the major connective tissue protein
in the body.  Ascorbic acid acts in these hydroxy&shy;lation
reactions by reducing the metal catalytic sites of
pro&shy;col&shy;lagen proline&nbsp;4&#8209;dioxy&shy;genase
(EC&nbsp;1.14.11.2) and
pro&shy;col&shy;lagen lysine&nbsp;5&#8209;dioxy&shy;gen&shy;ase
(EC&nbsp;1.14.11.4).  Decreased
activity of these two enzymes can lead to the defects in
connective tissue that in turn cause the charac&shy;teristic
clinical features of scurvy.  These include joint pain,
tooth loss, bone and connective tissue disorders, and poor
wound healing.  Ascorbic acid is also involved in the
hydroxy&shy;lation of dopamine to nora&shy;dren&shy;aline, by acting as a
cofactor for the enzyme dopamine-&beta;-mono&shy;oxy&shy;genase
(EC&nbsp;1.14.17.1).  Nora&shy;dren&shy;aline
is a neuro&shy;trans&shy;mitter, and
deficient dopamine hydroxyl&shy;ation may be associ&shy;ated with the
mood changes, depression, and hypo&shy;chondria that can occur
with scurvy.  The early symptoms of scurvy &mdash; fatigue,
lethargy, and muscle weakness &mdash; are related to the role of
ascorbic acid as a cofactor for maximal activity of two
dioxy&shy;genases involved in carnitine bio&shy;synthesis
(N&#8209;tri&shy;methyl&shy;lysine dioxy&shy;genase; EC&nbsp;1.14.11.8, and
&gamma;&#8209;butyro&shy;betaine dioxy&shy;genase;
EC&nbsp;1.14.11.1).  Carnitine is
essential for the transport of activated long-chain fatty
acids into the mito&shy;chondria, where they are converted to
energy by way of &beta;&#8209;oxidation

target="right" >Englard & Seifter, 1986</a>)</span>.

<p></p>
Several other enzymes depend on ascorbic acid as a cofactor,
although their specific role in the development of scurvy is
still unclear.  These include peptidyl&shy;glycine &alpha;&#8209;amidating
mono&shy;oxy&shy;genase (EC&nbsp;1.14.17.3), an enzyme required for the
synthesis of numerous amidated peptide hormones which have
multiple functions throughout the body

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3015170/"
target="right" >Englard & Seifter, 1986</a>)</span>.

More recent discoveries have included the
hydroxylases that regulate the concen&shy;tration and activity of
the trans&shy;cription factor hypoxia-inducible factor&#8209;1&alpha;  (i.e.
hypoxia-inducible factor &mdash; proline dioxy&shy;genase; EC&nbsp;1.14.11.29,
and hypoxia-inducible factor &mdash; asparagine dioxy&shy;genase;
EC&nbsp;1.14.11.30)

<span data-tippy-content="Kuiper, C., & Vissers, M. C. (2014). Ascorbate as a co-factor for fe- and 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases: physiological activity in tumor growth and progression. Frontiers in oncology, 4, 359.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25540771/"

and the ten-eleven
trans&shy;location (TET) hydroxy&shy;lases and histone demethylases
that modify epigenetic marks on DNA and histones

<span data-tippy-content="Young, J. I., Züchner, S., & Wang, G. (2015). Regulation of the Epigenome by Vitamin C. Annual review of nutrition, 35, 545&ndash;564.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25974700/"
target="right" >Young et al., 2015</a>)</span>.

Together, these epigenetic and transcription
regulating enzymes have the potential to up- and down-regulate
thousands of genes in the body, likely contributing
to vitamin&nbsp;C's pleiotropic functions in human health and
disease.
<p></p>
Ascorbic acid also has several nonenzymatic
functions based on its role as a reducing agent and
antioxidant (i.e. electron donation).  For example, ascorbic
acid enhances the gastro&shy;intestinal absorp&shy;tion of nonheme
iron, through its ability to reduce intra&shy;luminal iron to its
more absorbable ferrous form

<span data-tippy-content="Hallberg, L., Brune, M., & Rossander-Hulthén, L. (1987). Is there a physiological role of vitamin C in iron absorption?. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 498, 324&ndash;332.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3304065/"
target="right" >Hallberg et al., 1987</a>)</span>.

Ascorbic acid is a potent anti&shy;oxidant, with the ability to
quench a wide range of reactive oxygen species, including
neutralising phagocyte-derived oxidants, thus attenuating tissue damage

<span data-tippy-content="Carr, A., & Frei, B. (1999). Does vitamin C act as a pro-oxidant under physiological conditions?. FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, 13(9), 1007&ndash;1024.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10336883/"
target="right" >Carr & Frei, 1999a</a>)</span>.

Ascorbic acid provides important anti&shy;oxidant protection to plasma lipids
and lipid mem&shy;branes through direct scavenging of reactive
oxygen species and through the regeneration of vitamin&nbsp;E
from its oxidised form (&alpha;&#8209;tocopheroxyl radical).  Ascorbic
acid can also regenerate the enzyme cofactor
tetra&shy;hydro&shy;biopterin from its oxidised form
(dihydro&shy;biopterin), thus potentially aiding synthesis of
dopamine, sero&shy;tonin and nitric oxide.  At high intakes,
vitamin&nbsp;C has been associated with protection against
cardio&shy;vascular disease, cataracts, and cancer

<span data-tippy-content="Carr, A. C., & Frei, B. (1999). Toward a new recommended dietary allowance for vitamin C based on antioxidant and health effects in humans. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 69(6), 1086&ndash;1107.">

and a variety of immune-related functions

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099763/"
target="right" >Carr & Maggini, 2017</a>)</span>.

Additional research, however, is
needed to establish causal relation&shy;ships between vitamin&nbsp;C
and these degenerative diseases and immuno&shy;competence.

<h3 id="19.3">19.3 Absorp&shy;tion and metabolism of vitamin&nbsp;C</h3>

Vitamin&nbsp;C is absorbed in the small intestine by an active sodium-dependent
vitamin&nbsp;C&nbsp;trans&shy;porter (SVCT&#8209;1)
that is dose dependent and can become saturated

<span data-tippy-content="Savini, I., Rossi, A., Pierro, C., Avigliano, L., & Catani, M. V. (2008). SVCT1 and SVCT2: key proteins for vitamin C uptake. Amino acids, 34(3), 347&ndash;355.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17541511/"
target="right" >Savini et al., 2008</a>)</span>.

About 70%&ndash;90% of vitamin&nbsp;C
is absorbed when daily intakes range from 30&nbsp;to 180mg, but
absorp&shy;tion falls to &le;&nbsp;50% at intakes above 1g/d

target="right" >Levine et al., 1996</a>)</span>.

Indeed, the osmotic diarrhea and
intestinal discomfort some&shy;times experienced by
persons ingesting large gram doses of vitamin&nbsp;C is due to
the presence of a large amount of unabsorbed vitamin&nbsp;C.
Regulation of the whole body vitamin&nbsp;C content is achieved
in part by this dose-dependent intestinal absorp&shy;tion of
vitamin&nbsp;C. Renal action to conserve vitamin&nbsp;C (via SVCT&#8209;1)
or excrete unmeta&shy;bolized vitamin&nbsp;C also plays an important
part.  Tissue uptake occurs primarily by the SVCT&#8209;2 isoform

<span data-tippy-content="Savini, I., Rossi, A., Pierro, C., Avigliano, L., & Catani, M. V. (2008). SVCT1 and SVCT2: key proteins for vitamin C uptake. Amino acids, 34(3), 347&ndash;355.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17541511/"
target="right" >Savini et al., 2008</a>)</span>.

Different tissues uptake and retain
vitamin&nbsp;C to variable extents, with neuronal and glandular
tissues containing the highest concen&shy;trations

<span data-tippy-content="Hornig D. (1975). Distribution of ascorbic acid, metabolites and analogues in man and animals. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 258, 103&ndash;118.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1106295/"
target="right" >Hornig, 1975</a>)</span>,

indicating vital roles for vitamin&nbsp;C in these
tissues.  Catabolism of ascorbic acid in humans occurs
through oxidation to dehydro&shy;ascorbic acid and, in the
absence of sufficient reducing equivalents, subsequent
hydrolysis to diketogulonic acid.  This can then be oxidised
to smaller molecules, such as oxalate, that are excreted in
urine.  However, it should be noted that dehydroascorbic
acid is readily taken up via cell membrane glucose
transporters (GLUTs) and rapidly reduced back to ascorbic
acid via various chemical and enzymatic pathways

<span data-tippy-content="Rumsey, S. C., Kwon, O., Xu, G. W., Burant, C. F., Simpson, I., & Levine, M. (1997). Glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 and GLUT3 transport dehydroascorbic acid. The Journal of biological chemistry, 272(30), 18982&ndash;18989.">

thus limiting
dehydro&shy;ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations in vivo.  With large
intakes, most of the vitamin&nbsp;C is excreted in its
unmetabolized form

<h3 id="19.4">19.4 Deficiency of vitamin&nbsp;C in humans </h3>

Clinical manifestations of scurvy, such
as weakness, petechial hemorrhages, gingival bleeding,
ecchymoses and subperiosteal hemorrhage, anemia, and defects
in bone development in children, are relatively rare in
high-income countries.  Nevertheless, vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency
has been observed in insti&shy;tution&shy;alized elderly subjects,
likely arising from inadequate intake of vitamin&nbsp;C

<span data-tippy-content="Carr, A. C., & Rowe, S. (2020). Factors Affecting Vitamin C Status and Prevalence of Deficiency: A Global Health Perspective. Nutrients, 12(7), 1963.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32630245/"
target="right" >Carr & Rowe, 2020</a>)</span>.

Alcoholic patients, those on restrictive diets
and people in refugee camps are also vulnerable to vitamin&nbsp;C
deficiency.  Infantile scurvy is rare because breast milk
provides adequate amounts of ascorbic acid and infant
formulas are fortified with sufficient ascorbic acid to
prevent the disease.
<p></p>
Subclinical vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency may
develop secon&shy;darily to some disease states such as severe
respiratory infections, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders,
cardio&shy;metabolic disorders and inflammatory diseases.  This
is likely partly due to the enhanced oxidative stress and
inflam&shy;mation associated with many of these diseases, as well
as the use of certain drugs (e.g.&nbsp;aspirin) or
chemo&shy;thera&shy;peutic agents that appear to affect the
bio&shy;avail&shy;ability or meta&shy;bolism of ascorbic acid

<h3 id="19.5">19.5 Food sources and dietary intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C</h3>

Vitamin&nbsp;C is synthesised in plants. However,
the vitamin&nbsp;C content of different foods is highly variable

<span data-tippy-content="Carr, A. C., & Rowe, S. (2020). Factors Affecting Vitamin C Status and Prevalence of Deficiency: A Global Health Perspective. Nutrients, 12(7), 1963.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32630245/"
target="right" >Carr & Rowe, 2020</a>)</span>.

Values can also depend on the
growing conditions, season of the year, stage of maturity,
location, and storage time prior to consumption.  Exposure
to high temperatures, oxidation, or cooking in large amounts
of water all reduce the vitamin&nbsp;C content of foods.
<p></p>
Major food sources of vitamin&nbsp;C in the diets of most high-income
countries are fresh fruits and fruit juices and some fresh
vegetables; they can contribute up to 90% of the vitamin&nbsp;C
intake.  Citrus and kiwifruit are par&shy;ticu&shy;larly rich sources
of vitamin&nbsp;C. Of the vegetables, potatoes can be one of the
most important sources of vitamin&nbsp;C in the diets of adults,
for example in the U.K.

<p></p>
Most staple foods, e.g. rice, wheat, maize and other grains, contain

In low-income countries, the supply of food sources of vitamin&nbsp;C
is often seasonal, so intakes may vary widely.  In The
Gambia, for example, intakes ranged from zero to 115mg/d in
one community, depending on the seasonal availability of
mangos, oranges, and grapefruit

<h3 id="19.6">19.6 Nutrient reference values for vitamin&nbsp;C </h3>

Several expert groups including the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the U.S. and the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have derived values for Average Requirements
(ARs) and Recommended Intakes (RIs) for vitamin&nbsp;C. The AR (U.S. equivalent,
Estimated Average Requirement) is set for a particular group of individuals and is
used to assess the prevalence of adequate
intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C within that group.
The RIs (U.S. equivalent, Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA);
EFSA equivalent, Population
Reference Intake) are derived from the ARs and its distribution and are used to
assess intakes and plan diets for individuals.
<p></p>
Recommendations for vitamin&nbsp;C intakes vary greatly around the world, with
recommended intakes (RIs) for individuals ranging from as low as 40mg/d in the U.K.
to 110mg/d by EFSA

<span data-tippy-content="Dietary Reference Valuesfor nutrients. Summary report. European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)Update:  4 September2019">

In the U.S., the RDAs established by the IOM in
2000 are 75mg/d and 90mg/d for women and men, respectively

The large discrepancies in the RIs have resulted in calls for harmonization

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32223303/"
target="right" >Carr & Lykkesfeldt, 2020</a>)</span>.

Higher vitamin&nbsp;C intakes are recommended by all expert groups for pregnant and
lactating women due to the needs of the developing fetus
and the transfer of vitamin&nbsp;C to breast milk. Further&shy;more,
some countries (e.g., the U.S.) recommend higher intakes
for smokers due an enhanced oxidative burden and
resultant increase in turn&shy;over of
vitamin&nbsp;C. Consequently, RIs for smokers may be increased
by &plus;20mg/d to &plus;80mg/d,
depending on the country.
<p></p>
Upper levels of intake (ULs) have also been derived for vitamin&nbsp;C by
some expert groups. The ULs represent daily intakes that if consumed
chronically over time will have a very low risk of causing adverse effects. Intakes
from all sources of vitamin&nbsp;C are considered: food and nutrient supplements.
Because vitamin&nbsp;C is water soluble,
however, any excess not required by the body is
readily excreted, therefore, there is no known upper toxic con&shy;cen&shy;tra&shy;tion.
Nevertheless, some countries have set ULs
ranging from 1&ndash;2g/d for adults based on
potential gastro&shy;intestinal disturbances at
very large (&gt;&nbsp;4g/d) doses. For more
details on the application of these nutrient reference values, see Chapter 8b.
<p></p>
In addition to diarrhea and other gastro&shy;intestinal
disturbances, possible adverse effects of excessive intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C
include an increase in the absorp&shy;tion of dietary iron
potentially leading to iron overload in people with
hemo&shy;chrom&shy;atosis, and hemo&shy;lytic anaemia in people with
glucose&#8209;6-phosphate dehydro&shy;genase deficiency due to an
inability to attenuate hydrogen peroxide gener&shy;ation.
Current evidence is insuf&shy;ficient to implicate high intakes
of vitamin&nbsp;C as a risk factor in oxalate stone formation.
Never&shy;the&shy;less, individ&shy;uals with hemo&shy;chrom&shy;atosis,
glucose&#8209;6-phos&shy;phate dehydro&shy;genase deficiency, and renal
disorders, may be susceptible to adverse effects from
excessive intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C

<h3 id="19.7">19.7 Indices of vitamin&nbsp;C status</h3>

There are no reliable functional tests of
vitamin&nbsp;C status.  Instead, static bio&shy;chem&shy;ical tests,
par&shy;ticu&shy;larly the mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of plasma or leuko&shy;cyte ascorbic
acid concen&shy;trations, are most frequently used to assess
vitamin&nbsp;C status.  These static bio&shy;chem&shy;ical tests are
discussed in detail below.

<h3 id="19.8">19.8 Plasma ascorbic acid</h3>

Ascorbic acid is transported in the plasma but is not bound
to any protein; almost all is present as the ascor&shy;bate
monoanion.  Plasma (or serum) ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations
are the most frequently used and practical index of
vitamin&nbsp;C status in studies of individuals and populations.
Concen&shy;trations are influenced by recent intake of the
vitamin, making fasting blood samples essential.

<h3 id="19.8.1">19.8.1 Ascorbic acid pharmacokinetics </h3>

Plasma ascorbic acid
concen&shy;trations exhibit a character&shy;istic sigmoidal
relation&shy;ship with intake,
as shown in <a href="#figure19.2">Figure&nbsp;19.2</a>.  In
adults, the steepest change is evident at intakes between
about 30 and 90mg/d of vitamin&nbsp;C. When intakes are below
about 20mg/d, most of the vitamin&nbsp;C enters the tissues, so there
is very little available for circulation in the blood.  For
intakes greater than 100mg/d, plasma concen&shy;trations tend to
plateau between 60 and 70&micro;mol/L, concen&shy;trations
representing the renal threshold and plasma saturation

When intakes exceed about 200mg/d, intestinal

<p></p>
As a result of this threshold effect with only limited
intestinal absorp&shy;tion at intakes &gt;&nbsp;200mg/d, and the excess
circu&shy;lating ascorbic acid being excreted in the urine,
plasma ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations cannot identify people
who are regularly con&shy;sum&shy;ing excessive amounts of vitamin&nbsp;C.
Hence, it is not surprising that in the U.S.&nbsp;National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES&nbsp;II), a
correlation between plasma ascorbic acid and vitamin&nbsp;C
intakes was only reported for people not taking vitamin&nbsp;C
supplements

However, strong correlations between dietary intakes of

been reported when habitual dietary intakes of ascorbic acid
are relatively modest (30&ndash;80mg/d)

Indeed, in such circum&shy;stances, plasma concen&shy;trations are
probably as accurate an indicator as concen&shy;trations in
leuko&shy;cytes.  However, the relation&shy;ship may be obscured in
epi&shy;demio&shy;logical studies by other factors that affect the
absorp&shy;tion or meta&shy;bolic turnover of vitamin&nbsp;C.
In NHANES&nbsp;III, for example, only 50% of adult men had serum ascorbic
acid concen&shy;trations &gt;&nbsp;38&micro;mol/L, although more than 75% had
dietary intakes higher than the estimated average
require&shy;ment (i.e., 75mg/d)

Such a discrep&shy;ancy
may be due, in part, to the high proportion of U.S.&nbsp;adult

<h3 id="19.8.2">19.8.2 Factors affecting plasma ascorbic acid</h3>

<b>Cigarette smoking</b> has a marked effect on plasma ascorbic
acid concen&shy;trations.  Many studies report lower plasma
ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations in smokers

The mechanism controlling the influence of cigarette

smokers than in non&shy;smokers

which is probably induced by increased oxidative stress from
substances in smoke.  Certainly, studies using isotopic&shy;ally
labeled ascorbic acid show an increased meta&shy;bolic turnover
of ascorbic acid in smokers (70mg/d versus 36mg/d for
non&shy;smokers), resulting in a 40% greater require&shy;ment for
vitamin&nbsp;C

<b>Sex</b> influences
plasma ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations; women have higher

explained by volumetric dilution due to differ&shy;ences in
fat-free mass

<span data-tippy-content="Jungert, A., & Neuhäuser-Berthold, M. (2015).

a premise supported by a lack of sex differ&shy;ences in plasma
ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations before adoles&shy;cence.  For
example, in NHANES&nbsp;III, higher serum ascor&shy;bate
concen&shy;trations in women than in men were only apparent in

This trend has been attributed in part to
lower dietary intakes because of problems of poor dentition
or chronic diseases that may influence absorp&shy;tion or
metabolism of the vitamin.  Never&shy;the&shy;less, at present, there is no evidence
that the elderly have higher vitamin&nbsp;C require&shy;ments than

Of note, the low (hypo&shy;vitamin&shy;osis&nbsp;C)
cut-off is when the &ldquo;sub-clinical&rdquo; signs and symptoms of
vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency start to be observed, e.g. changes in
mood and energy levels.

The prev&shy;alence of hypo&shy;vitamin&shy;osis&nbsp;C and
outright deficiency also tends to be relatively low in these
countries.  In contrast, many low-middle income popu&shy;la&shy;tions
typically have lower mean vitamin&nbsp;C status, and a higher
prev&shy;alence of hypo&shy;vitamin&shy;osis&nbsp;C and deficiency, largely
explained by lower dietary intakes.  Vitamin&nbsp;C status and
intake data from national surveys (e.g. U.S.&nbsp;NHANES and

<h3 id="19.8.4">19.8.4 Measurement of plasma ascorbic acid</h3>

Fasting blood samples are required for plasma ascorbic acid analysis.  The
samples need to be pre&shy;served immediately after collec&shy;tion to avoid
degrad&shy;ation of the ascorbic acid.  Meta&shy;phos&shy;phoric acid (or
tri&shy;chloro&shy;acetic acid) is typically used to precipitate
protein and to stabilize the ascorbic acid in the samples prior
to anal&shy;ysis.  Addition&shy;ally, a reducing agent, such as
dithio&shy;threitol (DTT), can be added to pre&shy;serve the ascorbic
acid in a reduced state.  The reducing agent TCEP
(tris(2-carboxy&shy;ethyl)phos&shy;phine) is versatile in that it can
also work in acidified solutions with longer incubation
times.  A metal chelator, such as DTPA
(diethylene&shy;tri&shy;amine&shy;penta&shy;acetic acid), can be added to
attenuate metal ion-dependent oxidation of ascorbic acid
(par&shy;ticu&shy;larly important if samples are hemol&shy;ysed).  It
should be noted that EDTA (ethylene&shy;diamine&shy;tetra&shy;acetic acid),
although a commonly used metal-chelator, is
redox-active and can catalyse the oxidation of ascorbic acid if the
samples are not handled appro&shy;priately

prepared appropriately and frozen at &minus;20&deg;C are stable for
several weeks and at &minus;70&deg;C for at least 1y

before processing

Care needs to be
taken with choice of anti-coagulants for collec&shy;tion of blood
samples as the anti-coagulant EDTA, although a
metal-chelator, remains redox active and can result in loss
of ascorbic acid if the blood or plasma samples are not kept
at 4&deg;C

Several methods are available
for measuring vitamin&nbsp;C in both the reduced form or as total
ascorbic acid.  The older colour&shy;imetric or fluoro&shy;metric
assays use pre&shy;dom&shy;inantly 2,4&#8209;dinitro&shy;phenyl&shy;hydrazine or
o&#8209;phenyl&shy;enediamine.  These methods, however, have a number
of limit&shy;ations

<span data-tippy-content="Washko, P. W., Welch, R. W., Dhariwal, K. R., Wang, Y., & Levine, M. (1992). Ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid analyses in biological samples. Analytical biochemistry, 204(1), 1&ndash;14.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1514674/"
target="right" >Washko et al., 1992</a>)</span>.

Their sensit&shy;ivity and
specif&shy;icity is low, and they are often subject to
inter&shy;ference by other biolog&shy;ical substances and yield
falsely high readings at low ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations.
In some circum&shy;stances, inadver&shy;tent oxidation of ascorbic
acid or hydrol&shy;ysis of dehydro&shy;ascorbic acid may occur.
<p></p>
The method of choice for measuring ascorbic acid in plasma
samples is high-perform&shy;ance liquid chrom&shy;atography (HPLC);
only 50&micro;L of plasma is required for the measure&shy;ment.  Of
the HPLC methods available, electro&shy;chemical detection is
preferred, with its high selec&shy;tivity and sensitivity.
However, this method does require a dedicated instru&shy;ment and
an experienced operator

<span data-tippy-content="Washko, P. W., Hartzell, W. O., & Levine, M. (1989). Ascorbic acid analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with coulometric electrochemical detection. Analytical biochemistry, 181(2), 276&ndash;282.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2817392/"
target="right" >Washko et al., 1989</a>)</span>.

Other simpler methods use HPLC coupled with an ultra&shy;violet
detector, but these methods can have a lower sensitivity and specificity

<span data-tippy-content="Washko, P. W., Welch, R. W., Dhariwal, K. R., Wang, Y., & Levine, M. (1992). Ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid analyses in biological samples. Analytical biochemistry, 204(1), 1&ndash;14.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1514674/"
target="right" >Washko et al., 1992</a>)</span>.
<p></p>
Analysis of dehydroascorbic acid by HPLC is more difficult because
direct electro&shy;chemical or UV detection of dehydro&shy;ascorbic
acid is not possible.  Instead, samples must first be
anal&shy;ysed for ascorbic acid and then reduced for mea&shy;sure&shy;ment
of ascor&shy;bate plus dehydro&shy;ascorbic acid.  Dehydro&shy;ascorbic
acid is then deter&shy;mined by subtraction.  <i>In vivo</i>
concen&shy;trations of dehydro&shy;ascorbic acid are generally very
low (e.g. &lt;&nbsp;2&micro;mol/L) due to rapid uptake (via GLUTs) and
intra&shy;cellular reduction to ascorbic acid by cells of the
vascu&shy;lature.  Therefore, reports of higher
plasma (or serum) concen&shy;trations of
dehydro&shy;ascorbic acid in different disease states are likely
due to arte&shy;factual <i>ex vivo</i> oxidation often associated with
use of the older spectro&shy;photo&shy;metric methods and/or
inap&shy;pro&shy;priate handling and pro&shy;cessing of the samples prior
to analysis

plasma, erythro&shy;cytes, or whole blood

Leuko&shy;cyte ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations are less
responsive than plasma to short-term fluctuations in recent
vitamin&nbsp;C intakes.  In the study shown in

<a href="#figure19.5">Figure&nbsp;19.5,</a>
<a id="figure19.5"></a>		

leukocyte ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations decreased about 33%,

Thus, they provide a less sensitive measure of lower intakes.

Concen&shy;trations of ascorbic acid in
leukocytes reflect changes in tissue ascorbic acid
concen&shy;trations and the ascorbic acid body pool, but not
dietary intakes.  Animal studies (i.e., monkeys and guinea

Some additional non-dietary factors that influence concen&shy;trations
of ascorbic acid in leuko&shy;cytes are smoking, sex, infection,
and certain drugs, as discussed for plasma ascorbic acid
concen&shy;trations.  In some cases, these effects are due to
alterations in cell pop&shy;ula&shy;tions (e.g., acute infection) or
to differ&shy;ences in ascorbic acid uptake

<p></p>
Finally, concen&shy;trations of vitamin&nbsp;C in phago&shy;cytic cells,
such as neutro&shy;phils, can be influenced by activation of
their oxidative burst.  This results in the gener&shy;ation of
reactive oxygen species which oxidise extra&shy;cellular ascorbic
acid to dehydro&shy;ascorbic acid that is readily transported
into the cells via membrane GLUTs, where it is then rapidly
reduced back to ascorbic acid

The specific cell type that is most useful for assessing vitamin&nbsp;C
status is presently uncertain.  As noted earlier, both
ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations in individual leuko&shy;cytes and
their response to vitamin&nbsp;C sup&shy;plement&shy;ation vary.
Mono&shy;nuclear cells (lympho&shy;cytes and mono&shy;cytes) have
concen&shy;trations that are two- to three&shy;fold higher than

measured concen&shy;trations of ascorbic acid in purified
neutro&shy;phils, mono&shy;cytes and lympho&shy;cytes.  Neutro&shy;phil ascorbic
acid concen&shy;trations increased markedly in response to
supple&shy;mental vitamin&nbsp;C intakes of between 30&nbsp;and 100mg/d
but showed little further increase at higher doses.  This
trend is similar to that observed for plasma ascorbic acid
concen&shy;trations (Figure 19.2), although the latter reach a
plateau at higher daily doses (about 200mg/d).  The
concen&shy;trations of ascorbic acid in purified mono&shy;cytes and
lympho&shy;cytes followed a similar trend, again reaching a
plateau at doses of 100mg/d.

<h3 id="19.9.3">19.9.3 Interpretive criteria for leukocytes </h3>

Confusion exists over the inter&shy;pretive
criteria used for leukocyte ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations, in
part because they can be expressed in different ways:  per
10<sup>8</sup> cells, per mL, per DNA con&shy;cen&shy;tra&shy;tion, or per unit of
protein.  This makes compar&shy;isons among laboratories
difficult.  The most common method is in terms of cell
numbers (nmol/10<sup>8</sup> cells).  The hetero&shy;geneous nature of the
leuko&shy;cytes and various technical difficulties with their
analyses, are further com&shy;plic&shy;ating factors.

expressed in terms of cell
numbers.  When expressed in this way, clinical signs of
scurvy, such as swollen or bleeding gums or petechial
hemor&shy;rhages, have been associated with leuko&shy;cyte
concen&shy;trations of about 11nmol/10<sup>8</sup> cells.  Even at
concen&shy;trations as high as 50nmol/10<sup>8</sup> cells, scorbutic

<h3 id="19.10">19.10 Ascorbic acid in erythrocytes and whole blood</h3>

Erythrocyte ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations are not
widely used as an index of ascorbic acid status.
Concen&shy;trations are roughly comparable to plasma but only
respond to changes in vitamin&nbsp;C intake over a narrow range.
Hence, they are not as sensitive as plasma ascorbic acid
concen&shy;trations

Because erythro&shy;cyte
concen&shy;trations are less responsive to recent dietary intake,
they could potentially be used to assess ascorbic acid
status in non-fasting individuals

Erythro&shy;cyte ascorbic acid is technic&shy;ally

<h3 id="19.11">19.11 Urinary excretion of ascorbic acid and metabolites</h3>

Urine is the major excretory route for absorbed ascorbic acid.  Most
ascorbic acid is excreted in its un&shy;metabol&shy;ized form

<span data-tippy-content="Levine, M., Conry-Cantilena, C., Wang, Y., Welch, R. W., Washko, P. W., Dhariwal, K. R., Park, J. B., Lazarev, A., Graumlich, J. F., King, J., & Cantilena, L. R. (1996).

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8623000/"
target="right" >Levine et al., 1996</a>)</span>.

When intakes are &gt;&nbsp;1g/d, there is some
increase in oxalate excretion

<span data-tippy-content="Olson, J. A., & Hodges, R. E. (1987). Recommended dietary intakes (RDI) of vitamin C in humans. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 45(4), 693&ndash;703.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3565296/"
target="right" >Olson & Hodges, 1987</a>)</span>.

However, reports of high oxalate excretion are likely due to
arte&shy;factual <i>ex vivo</i> oxidation of excreted ascorbic acid
prior to analysis

<span data-tippy-content="Chalmers, A. H., Cowley, D. M., & McWhinney, B. C. (1985). Stability of ascorbate in urine: relevance to analyses for ascorbate and oxalate. Clinical chemistry, 31(10), 1703&ndash;1705.">

therefore careful handling of urine samples is required.
<p></p>
Urinary excretion of
ascorbic acid reflects recent dietary intake.  Experi&shy;mental
depletion-repletion studies have demon&shy;strated that
concen&shy;trations in the urine decline progres&shy;sively with
increasing depletion of vitamin&nbsp;C until, in persons with
scurvy, concen&shy;trations are undetect&shy;able

<span data-tippy-content="Jacob, R. A., Skala, J. H., & Omaye, S. T. (1987). Biochemical indices of human vitamin C status. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 46(5), 818&ndash;826.">

Never&shy;theless, urinary excretion is not a very
sensitive index of ascorbic acid status; differ&shy;ences between
persons with adequate or deficient intakes of ascorbic acid
are small.  For example, in the depletion-repletion study of
11&nbsp;young men shown in

acid, however, is also low.  The drugs amino&shy;pyrine, aspirin,
barbit&shy;urates, hydantoins, and para&shy;ldehyde can all increase
urinary ascorbic acid excretion

An additional disadvantage of this test as a measure of
ascorbic acid status in humans is the requirement for
24h&nbsp;urine speci&shy;mens.  The latter, although useful in clin&shy;ical or research settings, are less practical in field studies.

<h3 id="19.11.1">19.11.1.  Measurement of urinary ascorbic acid </h3>
	
Ascorbic acid is unstable in urine and samples should ideally be kept at 4&deg;C and
stabil&shy;ized with a metal chelator (e.g.  DTPA) and
acid&shy;ific&shy;ation (e.g. with meta&shy;phos&shy;phoric acid) as soon as
possible after collec&shy;tion.  HPLC with electro&shy;chemical
detection is the preferred method of analysis.  Values can
be presented as amount excreted per hour or day, or relative
to urine creat&shy;inine concen&shy;trations for spot collections, to
account for urine concen&shy;tration.

<h3 id="19.12">19.12 Ascorbic acid in other cells and fluids </h3>

Ascorbic acid has been detected in a
number of other body fluids.  The concen&shy;trations in saliva
and alveolar lining fluid are generally relatively low and
do not appear to correlate with concen&shy;trations of ascorbic
acid in plasma, leuko&shy;cytes, or dietary intakes

Buccal cell ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations have
been invest&shy;igated as a potential bio&shy;marker of vitamin&nbsp;C
status.  In a vitamin&nbsp;C depletion-repletion study in healthy
men, buccal cell ascorbic acid concen&shy;trations were
signif&shy;icantly lower in subjects receiving low ascorbic acid
intakes (5,&nbsp;10, 20mg/d) compared with repletion intakes
(60&nbsp;or 250mg/d)

Neverthe&shy;less, the
invest&shy;igators concluded that buccal cells are probably not
suitable as a marker of ascorbic acid status over a broad
range of popu&shy;lation intakes.  In contrast, muscle tissue
obtained by needle biopsy has been shown to correlate
relatively well with plasma concen&shy;trations and dietary
intake

<h3 id="19.13">19.13 Body pool size</h3>
	
Isotope dilution techniques can be used to determine the size of the
body pool of vitamin&nbsp;C. The method involves admin&shy;istration
of an oral dose of <sup>14</sup>C&#8209;labeled

followed by the measure&shy;ment of the specific activity of

<h3 id="19.14">19.14 Functional tests of vitamin&nbsp;C status</h3>

There are currently no specific functional tests for vitamin&nbsp;C status.
Bleeding into the skin to form petechia, purpura and
ecchy&shy;moses are a sign of the vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency disease
scurvy.  Capillary fragility has been used in the
past as a functional test of vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency
<span data-tippy-content="Vilter RW. (1967). Effects of ascorbic acid deficiency in man. In: Sebrell WH Jr, Harris RS (eds.) The Vitamins: Chemistry, Physiology, Pathology, Methods. Volume I. Academic Press, New York, pp. 457&ndash;485.*** NOT ON MEDLINE ***">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//"
target="right" >Vilter, 1967</a>)</span>.

However, this test can produce inconsistent results
in individ&shy;uals with vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency and is not specific
to vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency states as other diseases may also
increase capil&shy;lary fragility
<span data-tippy-content="Vilter RW. (1967). Effects of ascorbic acid deficiency in man. In: Sebrell WH Jr, Harris RS (eds.) The Vitamins: Chemistry, Physiology, Pathology, Methods. Volume I. Academic Press, New York, pp. 457&ndash;485.*** NOT ON MEDLINE ***">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//"
target="right" >Vilter, 1967</a>)</span>.

Erythro&shy;cyte fragility could be an alternative functional test of deficiency
<span data-tippy-content="Tu, H., Li, H., Wang, Y., Niyyati, M., Wang, Y., Leshin, J., & Levine, M. (2015). Low Red Blood Cell Vitamin C Concentrations Induce Red Blood Cell Fragility: A Link to Diabetes Via Glucose, Glucose Transporters, and Dehydroascorbic Acid. EBioMedicine, 2(11), 1735&ndash;1750.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26870799/"
target="right" >Tu et al., 2015</a>)</span>,

however, once again,
this is not specific for vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency.
Consequently, altern&shy;ative functional tests of ascorbic acid
status need to be developed.
<p></p>
Specific markers of ascorbic
acid’s enzyme cofactor functions have been proposed.  An
example relates to collagen cross&shy;linking

<span data-tippy-content="Munday, K., Fulford, A., & Bates, C. J. (2005). Vitamin C status and collagen cross-link ratios in Gambian children. The British journal of nutrition, 93(4), 501&ndash;507.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15946412/"
target="right" >Munday et al., 2005</a>)</span>.

In this study, urinary excretion of specific
cross&shy;link ratios were higher in British children versus
Gambian children, and in Gambian children during the dry
season (character&shy;ised by high vitamin&nbsp;C intake and status)
versus the rainy season.  A supplement&shy;ation study (100mg/d
of vitamin&nbsp;C) in Gambian children during the rainy season
did not, however, alter the crosslink ratio.  This may have
been due to the supplementation period (7wks) being
insufficient, as collagen can have a long turnover in some
tissues.
<p></p>
Another possibility is assess&shy;ment of vitamin&nbsp;C-dependent
epi&shy;genetic marks

<span data-tippy-content="Young, J. I., Züchner, S., & Wang, G. (2015). Regulation of the Epigenome by Vitamin C. Annual review of nutrition, 35, 545&ndash;564.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25974700/"
target="right" >Young et al., 2015</a>)</span>,

for example in leuko&shy;cytes.  One prelim&shy;inary study has
demon&shy;strated positive correl&shy;ations between vitamin&nbsp;C status
and hydroxy&shy;methyl&shy;cytosine and hydroxy&shy;methyl&shy;uracil marks in
leuko&shy;cyte DNA

(2018).

Participants with
vitamin&nbsp;C concen&shy;trations &gt;&nbsp;40&micro;mol/L
exhibited signif&shy;icantly
higher concen&shy;trations of these epi&shy;genetic marks than those
with plasma concen&shy;trations &lt;&nbsp;20&micro;mol/L.  As such, more
research in this area appears warranted.
