Dietary iron is present as heme and non&shy;heme iron,
each absorbed by dif&shy;fer&shy;ent mech&shy;anisms.  Once absorbed,
the iron released can be stored or bound to plasma trans&shy;ferrin
for distribution to other tissues.  Quantitatively,
most iron is used by immature red blood cells
in the bone marrow for hemo&shy;globin (Hb) produc&shy;tion.
Senescent erythrocytes are degraded by
macrophages, and the iron released from
catabolized Hb re-enters the circu&shy;lation.  Absorption
of iron is modulated in response to the level of body
iron stores and by the amount of iron needed for erythro&shy;poiesis.
Hepatic hepcidin is the master regulator of iron homeo&shy;stasis.
Hepcidin levels are suppressed by iron depletion
or increased iron demand (i.e., enhanced erythro&shy;poiesis),
thereby increasing absorp&shy;tion and
mobilization of iron from body stores into plasma.  In contrast, when iron stores
are replete (and during inflam&shy;mation),
hepcidin levels are increased, so iron cannot efflux
into the circu&shy;lation, thus preventing iron overload.
<p></p>
Anemia is the most common sign of iron deficiency
in low- and middle-income countries, with
with infants, young children, and women of child-bearing age
at greatest risk.  Features of iron defi&shy;ciency anemia (IDA)
include impairments in work capacity and cognition,
and possibly risk during preg&shy;nancy of low birth&shy;weight and
prem&shy;aturity.
Despite low specificity and sensitivity,
a low Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;tration is the most widely used
test for IDA.
Devel&shy;opment of IDA
occurs in three stages, the first being a decrease in iron stores,
reflected by a low serum ferritin, followed by iron-deficient erythro&shy;poiesis.
At this stage, iron stores are exhausted
(i.e., serum ferritin &lt;&nbsp;12&micro;g/L), iron
supply to the erythro&shy;poietic cells is progressively
reduced, and decreases in trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration
occur.  At the same time, serum soluble trans&shy;ferrin
receptor (sTfR) and erythrocyte proto&shy;porphyrin
increase. Only in the third stage is there a decline in Hb,
decreases in hematocrit and red-cell indices, and
frank microcytic, hypo&shy;chromic anemia,
confirmed by examination of a stained blood film.
<p></p>
This chapter describes how to assess the
adequacy of dietary iron intakes, followed by details of the
hematological parameters used to diagnose anemia,
the serum bio&shy;markers to identify iron depletion (serum ferritin),
and iron deficient erythro&shy;poiesis (serum ferritin;
serum iron; trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration; sTfR;
and erythrocyte protoporphyrin).
Advantages and limitations are discussed together with
details of the measure&shy;ment and interpretive criteria for
each bio&shy;marker.  Use of a regression modeling approach
to adjust for the effect of inflam&shy;mation on
serum ferritin and sTfR is highlighted, in view of the
challenge of distin&shy;guishing between IDA and
anemia of chronic disease.  The final section
emphasizes the simul&shy;tane&shy;ous use of multiple
iron bio&shy;markers to provide a more valid
assessment of iron status and minimize
misclassification that may occur when using a single measure.
The advantages of using the &ldquo;Total Body Iron Model&rdquo;
based on serum ferritin and sTfR expressed as body iron (mg/kg),
with a cutoff of &lt;&nbsp;0mg/kg to define iron defi&shy;ciency, is described.
Finally, details of emerging iron indicators,
notably hepcidin, non-trans&shy;ferrin-bound iron,
and some reticulocyte indices, are presented.

The assessment of the iron status of the popu&shy;lation is
critical: iron defi&shy;ciency is a widely recognized
micro&shy;nutrient defi&shy;ciency, and a public health problem worldwide.
<p></p>
The iron content of the human body is carefully regulated,
normally con&shy;taining about 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;4g of iron. Of
this, about 65% is present in hemoglobin (Hb), the
oxygen-carrying pigment of the red blood cells, that plays a critical
role in trans&shy;ferring oxygen from lung to tissues.
Hemo&shy;globin is made up of four heme subunits, each with a
poly&shy;peptide chain of globin attached. Each mole&shy;cule of
heme consists of a proto&shy;porphyrin IX mole&shy;cule with one
iron atom. In addition, about 3.5% of body iron is present
in myoglobin, the oxygen-binding storage protein found in
muscle. The structure of myo&shy;globin is similar to
Hb, except that it con&shy;tains only one heme unit
and one globin chain.

<h3 id="17.1.1">17.1.1 Distribution of body iron in men and women</h3>

<a href="#table17.1">Table&nbsp;17.1</a>
shows the amount of iron and its distribution
in the body in males and females.
Trace amounts of iron are also associated with electron
trans&shy;port and several enzymes. Examples include the
heme-con&shy;taining cyto&shy;chromes that serve as electron
carriers within the cell, iron-sulfur proteins (flavo&shy;proteins,
heme-flavo&shy;proteins) that are required for the first reaction
in the electron trans&shy;port chain, and hydrogen peroxidases
(e.g., catalase and peroxidase).

The cyto&shy;chrome-P450
family of enzymes also con&shy;tain heme and are located in
micro&shy;somal membranes of liver cells and intestinal
mucosal cells. Key functions of cyto&shy;chrome-P450 involve
detox&shy;ific&shy;ation of foreign substances in the liver, and
synthesis of prosta&shy;glandins, steroid hormones, and bile
acids

In addition to these functional forms, as much as 30% of
total body iron is present as storage iron, found primarily
in the liver. Smaller amounts occur in the
reticulo-endothelial cells of the bone marrow and spleen; and in
the muscle tissues. Of the storage iron, approx&shy;imately
two-thirds consists of ferritin, the soluble fraction of the
non&shy;heme iron stores. The remainder of storage iron is
insoluble hemo&shy;siderin. Small quantities of ferritin can be
synthesized in all cells of the body, even those with no
special iron storage function. Ferritin also appears in small
concen&shy;trations in the serum but is not involved in iron
trans&shy;port. In healthy
individuals with no evidence of inflam&shy;mation,
serum ferritin concen&shy;tration is closely
corre&shy;lated with the size of the iron store

Stored iron serves as a reservoir to supply cellular needs,
mainly Hb produc&shy;tion, and is especially impor&shy;tant
in the third trimester of preg&shy;nancy. The size of the storage
compo&shy;nent is most strongly influenced by age, sex, body
size, and either the magnitude of iron losses or the
presence of diseases of iron overload

Iron trans&shy;port is carried out by the trans&shy;port protein
trans&shy;ferrin, which comprises only about 0.1% of total
body iron (<a href="#table17.1">Table&nbsp;17.1</a>).
Trans&shy;ferrin delivers iron to the
tissues by means of cell membrane receptors specific for
trans&shy;ferrin (i.e., sTfR1 and sTfR2). About
<span class="n">20&#8209;30mg</span> of iron
cycles through the trans&shy;port compo&shy;nent each day.

<h3 id="17.1.2">17.1.2 Absorption and metabolism of iron</h3>

Four main factors in the body operate to maintain iron
balance and prevent iron defi&shy;ciency and iron overload.
These are: (a) intake, (b) absorp&shy;tion (c) storage, and (d) loss of iron. The
inter&shy;relation&shy;ship of these factors has now been described
mathematically, so that the amount of storage iron can be
predicted as long as iron losses and bioavail&shy;ability of iron
are known

<span data-tippy-content="Hallberg, L., Hulthén, L., and Garby, L. (1998). Iron stores in man in relation to diet and iron requirements. European journal of clinical nutrition, 52(9), 623&#8209;631.">

<p></p>
In an iron-sufficient adult male, absorp&shy;tion of iron from
the diet only con&shy;tributes about 1mg/d, while for
menstruating women, about 1.5mg/d is absorbed to
compensate for menstrual blood loss. There are two
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent forms of iron in the diet, heme and non&shy;heme,
each absorbed primarily in the duodenum. Heme iron is derived mainly from Hb
and myoglobin in red meat, poultry, and fish and is
absorbed readily as the intact iron porphyrin. Absorption
of heme iron ranges from <span class="n">15&#8209;35%</span> and is little
affected by dietary factors; absorp&shy;tion is regulated primarily in response
to total body iron. As demand for body iron increases
there is a corresponding up&shy;reg&shy;ulation in the uptake of
heme iron and also in the rate of transfer to the duodenal
entero&shy;cytes. Details of the exact mech&shy;anism controlling
heme iron absorp&shy;tion are poorly under&shy;stood

<span data-tippy-content="Anderson, G. J., and Frazer, D. M. (2017). Current understanding of iron homeo&shy;stasis. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 106(Suppl 6), 1559S&#8209;1566S.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29070551/"
target="right" >Anderson and Frazer, 2017</a>)</span>.

How&shy;ever, once absorbed, iron (Fe2<sup>+</sup>) is
released from heme iron by heme oxygenase, after which
the iron follows the same pathway as non&shy;heme iron, as described below

<p></p>
Non&shy;heme iron (i.e., inorganic iron) is found primarily in
plant-based foods, but also in meat, eggs, and some dairy foods. Liver,
iron-fortified foods, and the seeds of legumes, such as beans, con&shy;tain
non&shy;heme ion in the form of ferritin, although the
mech&shy;anism whereby ferritin iron is absorbed is poorly under&shy;stood

Plant ferritin is readily released during cooking and digestion

The absorp&shy;tion of non&shy;heme iron is less efficient than heme
iron and can range from <span class="n">2&#8209;20%,</span> depending on the iron
status of the individual and the simul&shy;tane&shy;ous ingestion of
other dietary compo&shy;nents; some inhibit and others
enhance non&shy;heme iron absorp&shy;tion. Most of the food
compo&shy;nents classed as inhibitors generally act by binding
iron in the gastro&shy;intestinal tract, preventing its absorp&shy;tion.
In contrast, the enhancers act by forming com&shy;plexes that
can be taken up by the intestinal iron trans&shy;port proteins,
thus preventing the iron from binding to the inhibitors.
Alternatively, they act by reducing the reactive ferric
(Fe3<sup>+</sup>) iron to its less reactive
and more soluble ferrous (Fe2<sup>+</sup>) state.
<p></p>
Inhibitors of non&shy;heme iron absorp&shy;tion include phytic acid,
poly&shy;phenols, calcium, and peptides from partially digested
proteins (e.g., soybean protein). Of these, phytic acid
(myoinositol hexa-phosphate, IP6) is the main inhibitor of
non&shy;heme iron absorp&shy;tion from plant-based diets.
How&shy;ever, traditional food processing methods such as
soaking, ger&shy;mina&shy;tion, and fer&shy;menta&shy;tion can lower the
phytic acid content, either by reducing the water-soluble phytate content,
or by phytase hydrolysis converting the phytic acid to lower myo-inositol phosphate
forms that no longer inhibit non&shy;heme iron absorp&shy;tion (i.e., IP2; IP1)

Poly&shy;phenol compounds from beverages such as tea, coffee, cocoa, and red wine,
veg&shy;etables (spinach, aubergine), legumes (colored beans),
and cereals such as red sorghum, also inhibit non&shy;heme iron
absorp&shy;tion. Their inhibitory effect is dose-dependent, the
strength depending on the structure of the phenolic
compounds, with the gallate-con&shy;taining tea poly&shy;phenols
having the largest inhibitory effect

Calcium inhibits both non&shy;heme and heme iron absorp&shy;tion,
although the inhibitory effect is weak and short-term, with
a mixed effect on iron status and no reduction in Hb

Of these, ascorbic acid is the most potent enhancer
of non&shy;heme iron absorp&shy;tion
through its ability to convert ferric (Fe3<sup>+</sup>) iron to ferrous
(Fe2<sup>+</sup>) iron at low pH as well as its chelating prop&shy;erties

The enhancing effect of ascorbic acid is dose-dependent and most marked when
consumed with meals con&shy;taining high levels of inhibitors,
including phytate and poly&shy;phenols. Ascorbic acid can also
enhance absorp&shy;tion of many iron fortif&shy;ication compounds

The mech&shy;anism whereby muscle tissue enhances
non&shy;heme iron absorp&shy;tion is not clear. It may be linked to
cysteine-con&shy;taining peptides released during digestion,
which have the potential to reduce ferric (Fe3<sup>+</sup>) iron to
ferrous (Fe2<sup>+</sup>) iron and chelate iron as described for ascorbic acid

Briefly, the non&shy;heme iron in foods that exists
predominantly as ferric (Fe3<sup>+</sup>) iron is sol&shy;ubil&shy;ized in the
gastro&shy;intestinal lumen, where first it is reduced by
duodenal cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;b reductase (DCYTB) to ferrous iron
(Fe2<sup>+</sup>) before being trans&shy;ported by the iron-import protein
divalent metal-ion trans&shy;porter&nbsp;1 (DMT1) into the
entero&shy;cytes of the small intestine.
When demand for iron is low, the iron can be
stored within the cell as the iron storage protein ferritin.
When the demand for body iron is high, iron is either
taken up by mito&shy;chondria for the synthesis of heme, or
exported into the circu&shy;lation by the iron export protein
ferroportin&nbsp;1 (FPN1). To leave the cell and bind to plasma
trans&shy;ferrin, how&shy;ever, Fe2<sup>+</sup> must
be oxidized back to Fe3<sup>+</sup>.
This oxidation is catalyzed by a membrane-bound
ferrox&shy;idase hephaestin. Trans&shy;ferrin-bound iron is then
distributed via the circu&shy;lation throughout the body to sites of utilization

Most of the iron is used by immature red blood cells in the bone marrow for
Hb produc&shy;tion.
<p></p>
Cells can take up iron in a variety of forms. All nucleated
cells are capable of using trans&shy;ferrin-bound iron, although
some cell types can take up iron in other forms, including
non-trans&shy;ferrin-bound iron, or iron present within ferritin,
heme, or Hb. Uptake and storage of iron in cells is
tightly controlled by iron regulatory proteins. These
ensure the iron supply to the cell is maximized when the
cell has an iron deficit. Alternatively, when the cell is iron
replete, the supply of iron to the cell is restricted and
storage pro&shy;moted. For more details of the regulation of
iron homeo&shy;stasis at the cellular level, see Anderson and Fraser

<span data-tippy-content="Anderson, G. J., and Frazer, D. M. (2017). Current understanding of iron homeo&shy;stasis. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 106(Suppl 6), 1559S&#8209;1566S.">

<p></p>
Whole-body iron levels are also strictly regulated. This
regulation is mediated by the liver-derived peptide
hepcidin which is responsible in part for the control of
dietary iron absorp&shy;tion as well as the export of iron from
body stores. When iron stores are low or iron utilization
such as erythro&shy;poiesis is increased, and when plasma
trans&shy;ferrin concen&shy;tration is reduced, hepcidin produc&shy;tion
is suppressed, stimu&shy;lating absorp&shy;tion and delivery of iron
to the plasma from storage sites. As a conse&shy;quence, more
iron enters the circu&shy;lation. In contrast, when hepatic
storage iron and circu&shy;lating trans&shy;ferrin concen&shy;trations are
high, the produc&shy;tion of hepcidin is increased, thereby
reducing intestinal iron absorp&shy;tion and inhibiting the
release of iron from body stores

<span data-tippy-content="Anderson, G. J., and Frazer, D. M. (2017). Current understanding of iron homeo&shy;stasis. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 106(Suppl 6), 1559S&#8209;1566S.">

Hepcidin produc&shy;tion is also stimulated by
cytokines such as inter&shy;leukins&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;6 induced by
inflam&shy;mation (see &ldquo;Acute and chronic inflam­mation&rdquo; in
<a href="#17.7.1">Section&nbsp;17.7.1</a> for more details).
<p></p>
The primary storage sites for iron are the cells of the liver,
spleen, and bone marrow. Iron is stored
in the form of the soluble protein complex ferritin, or
insoluble hemo&shy;siderin, as noted earlier. Iron from both forms of storage
iron can be mobilized efficiently when required else&shy;where in the body

<span data-tippy-content="Anderson, G. J., and Frazer, D. M. (2017). Current understanding of iron homeo&shy;stasis. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 106(Suppl 6), 1559S&#8209;1566S.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29070551/"
target="right" >Anderson and Frazer, 2017</a>)</span>.

The amount of iron in the stores varies widely, depending on iron status
and sex. When the iron supply exceeds the cell’s functional
needs, ferritin produc&shy;tion in the liver is increased, whereas
when the supply is insufficient, iron bound to ferritin will
be mobilized from the liver store.
<p></p>
Unlike many other micro&shy;nutrients, there are no active
pathways for excreting iron. Instead, mech&shy;anisms exist to
maintain both cellular and whole-body iron levels within
the optimal physiologic range, as noted above. Total daily
iron losses are small and occur mainly in the feces
(0.6mg/d), although very small amounts are also lost in
desquamated skin cells and sweat <span class="n">(0.2&#8209;0.3mg/d),</span> and in
urine (&lt;&nbsp;1mg/d). Most of the iron excreted in the feces is
from unabsorbed dietary iron, although a small amount is
systemic iron derived primarily from biliary secretions.
Total daily iron losses are larger (&asymp;&nbsp;1.3mg/d) in
pre&shy;menopausal women, because of the additional loss of
iron in menstrual blood. On average, menstrual blood loss
is <span class="n">30&#8209;40mL</span> per
cycle or <span class="n">0.4&#8209;0.5mg</span> iron per day,
although in some women it is much greater

<p></p>
Most of the heme iron in erythro&shy;cytes is recycled for
Hb synthesis at the end of the erythro&shy;cyte's functional
lifetime (on average 120d). At this time, the
erythro&shy;cytes are phagocytosed by specialized
macrophages in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. The
heme iron is released from catabolized Hb and is
either returned to the plasma via ferroportin where it is
bound to trans&shy;ferrin, or it is incor&shy;porated into ferritin for
temporary storage, depending on the iron status of the
individual. Smaller quantities of iron are exported by other
cells, particularly hepatocytes. This process is termed &ldquo;iron
turnover&rdquo;; each day 25mg systemic iron is recycled,
representing 0.66% of the total iron content of the body.

<h3 id="17.1.3">17.1.3 Micro&shy;nutrient interactions with the potential to affect
iron absorp&shy;tion and/or metabolism</h3>

Deficiencies of iron, vitamin&nbsp;A, iodine, and zinc are major
public health problems in low-income countries. They
often occur concurrently, especially among infants, young
children, and women
of reproductive age living in impoverished settings.
These high-risk groups all have high micro&shy;nutrient
requirements, but frequently low intakes of poorly
bioavailable micro&shy;nutrients. Interactions have been
described between these micro&shy;nutrients, although the
mech&shy;anisms are not always fully under&shy;stood.
<p></p>
<b>Iron-vitamin&nbsp;A interactions.</b> Vitamin&nbsp;A may affect several
stages of iron metabolism, including erythro&shy;poiesis,
incor&shy;poration of iron into Hb, and the
mobil&shy;ization of iron from ferritin stores

<h3 id="17.1.4">17.1.4 Defi&shy;ciency of iron in humans</h3>

Iron defi&shy;ciency may arise from inadequate intakes of
dietary iron, poor absorp&shy;tion, excessive iron losses, or a
combination of these factors. Individuals at greatest risk
for iron defi&shy;ciency include those with high iron
requirements for growth (i.e., infants, children and
pregnant women), and women of child bearing age with
high menstrual losses. Several risk factors have been
identified. In industrial&shy;ized countries, prem&shy;aturity
or low-birth&shy;weight, the use of a non-iron-fortified formula, the
introduction in young children to cow's milk in the first year of life, and
exclusive breast&shy;feeding after 6mos without the regular feeding of iron
fortified complementary foods, are all frequently
observed causal factors. Among pregnant
women, diets low in iron-rich foods, a short
interpreg&shy;nancy interval, and increasingly, obesity, are implicated

In some impoverished settings, additional factors causing iron
defi&shy;ciency may include: bleeding arising
from exposure to parasitic helminths (e.g., hookworm) or
schistosomiasis, impaired absorp&shy;tion from
infection / inflam&shy;mation or possibly chronic <i>Helicobacter
pylori</i> gastritis. In rare cases, genetic distur&shy;bances in iron
homeo&shy;stasis arising from genetic mutations, such as in the

Numerous human studies have also investigated the
associ&shy;ation between iron defi&shy;ciency and cognitive
function. Inter&shy;pretation of these data are difficult because
neither iron defi&shy;ciency nor the assessment of cognitive

Nevertheless, iron is known to be essential for the normal
devel&shy;opment and function of the brain. Animal research
indicates that changes in neuro&shy;transmitter homeo&shy;stasis
and decreases in basal ganglia are all caused by iron
defi&shy;ciency. Hence, early identifi&shy;cation and treatment of
iron defi&shy;ciency-induced brain dysfunction appears to be
critical to recover neural function and thus prevent any
long-term effects on brain devel&shy;opment. How&shy;ever,
such effects will depend on timing and the degree of iron
defi&shy;ciency. Long-term effects are most likely if the
defi&shy;ciency occurs during a time period when the need for
iron for neuro&shy;develop&shy;ment is high

Numerous studies have investigated associ&shy;ations between
maternal iron defi&shy;ciency anemia or iron defi&shy;ciency
(without anemia) and risk of functional adverse preg&shy;nancy
outcomes such as prem&shy;aturity and low birth&shy;weight, and
maternal and neonatal mortality. Most have been based
on comparisons between the effects of daily oral

no iron or placebo during preg&shy;nancy. Despite reducing the
risk of maternal anemia and iron defi&shy;ciency, the effects of
iron supple&shy;mentation during preg&shy;nancy on functional
maternal and infant outcomes have been inconsistent.
Some studies have shown signif&shy;icant reductions, for
example, in risk of low birth weight

Concern has been raised that some of these
inconsistencies across studies may be linked to the
defin&shy;ition of anemia applied, the timing of exposure, the
pattern of changes in iron bio&shy;markers during preg&shy;nancy,
and the definitions of normal or &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; reference
ranges for Hb applied for comparison.
In an effort to address at
least some of these concerns, Young et&nbsp;al.

maternal Hb has an impor&shy;tant role in relation to several
maternal and child health outcomes; for more specific

Note that the summary estimates for the associ&shy;ation of
low birth-weight with iron defi&shy;ciency anemia and non&#8209;iron
defi&shy;ciency anemia were both positive, although not
statistically signif&shy;icant, whereas for preterm birth the
pooled estimate with non&#8209;iron deficient popu&shy;lations was
non-signif&shy;icant, and data insufficient to derive a pooled
estimate for iron defi&shy;ciency anemia.
The odds of small for gesta&shy;tional age with
iron defi&shy;ciency were decreased (2&nbsp;studies)
although there was no signif&shy;icant associ&shy;ation between
small for gesta&shy;tional age and non&#8209;iron defi&shy;ciency
anemia (4&nbsp;studies).
Given the complexity of the changes in iron homeo&shy;stasis and
associated iron bio&shy;markers during preg&shy;nancy together with the diverse
factors associated with etiology of anemia, research that
includes some of the newer bio&shy;markers such as serum
hepcidin may help to resolve some of the reasons for the
inconsistencies in the results observed.

<h3 id="17.1.5">17.1.5 Food sources and dietary intakes</h3>

High-iron foods include liver, kidney, mussels, and red
meat. Foods with a medium iron content include chicken,
processed meat, fish, and legumes (non-heme iron only).
Milk and milk products and many fruits and veg&shy;etables are
poor sources of dietary iron

The bioavail&shy;ability of iron from mixed Western-style
diets (for individuals with no iron stores) is estimated to
range from <span class="n">14&#8209;18%,</span> provided the diets con&shy;tain ample
quantities of flesh foods and ascorbic acid. In low-income
countries, how&shy;ever, dietary iron absorp&shy;tion is often probably
only about <span class="n">5&#8209;12%</span> for individuals with no iron stores
because in these plant-based diets the proportion of heme iron is low, while
the content of absorp&shy;tion inhibitors is often signif&shy;icant

The rise in the variety of food products fortified with iron
has prompted research on the prop&shy;erties of iron
fortificants. Factors affecting their choice include
absorbability (i.e., the highest relative bioavail&shy;ability (RBV)
compared with ferrous sulfate), absence of unacceptable
changes to the sensory prop&shy;erties (i.e., taste, color,
texture) of the food vehicle, and the cost of the fortificant. The
iron compounds used for fortif&shy;ication or for enrichment
can be divided into three categories &mdash; water soluble;
poorly water soluble but soluble in dilute acid; water
insoluble and poorly soluble in dilute acid. Almost all enter
the common non&shy;heme iron pool in the gastro&shy;intestinal
tract and are absorbed like native non&shy;heme iron
compounds. The third category, how&shy;ever, &mdash; water
insoluble and poorly soluble in dilute acid &mdash; do not fully
enter the common non&shy;heme iron pool, and their
absorp&shy;tion is poor.
<p></p>
The compounds currently used as iron fortificants in order
of frequency of use are : (1)&nbsp;ferrous sulfate; (2)&nbsp;ferrous fumarate;
(3)&nbsp;encapsulated ferrous sulfate or encapsulated ferrous
fumarate; (4)&nbsp;electrolytic iron (a pure form of
iron powder with a small particle
size) or ferric pyrophosphate;
(5)&nbsp;sodium-iron-ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic-acid (NaFeEDTA);
and (6)&nbsp;iron amino acid chelates, particularly iron-glycinate chelates

Certain genetic mutations can cause iron overload. One of
the most well-known examples is hereditary
hemo&shy;chromatosis arising from a mutation in HFE gene
that results in a reduced or negligible expres&shy;sion of
hepcidin. This results in an inability to limit absorp&shy;tion of
dietary iron, so iron accumulates in many organs.
Hemo&shy;chromatosis is relatively common in Northern
European popu&shy;lations

hetero&shy;zygotes for the mutation associated with hemo&shy;chromatosis,
how&shy;ever, do not appear to be at an increased risk of iron overload.
<p></p>
Iron overload has also
been associated with other genetic defects such as
atrans&shy;ferrinemia, acerulo&shy;plasmin&shy;emia, and Friedreich
ataxia. African iron overload, previously termed &ldquo;Bantu
cirrhosis&rdquo;, is also thought to have a genetic compo&shy;nent in
addition to the excessive intakes of iron from food and
beer prepared in iron utensils

(<a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/4254"
target="right" >EFSA, 2015</a>)</span>.

Iron overload may also result from the multiple blood transfusions used to
treat certain inherited disorders such as iron-loading
anemia (e.g., &beta;&#8209;thalassemia). In most iron overload
syndromes, iron is sequestered in ferritin and hemo&shy;siderin
in all tissues throughout the body.
<p></p>
Concern has been raised that supple&shy;mentation of iron
given in non-physio&shy;logical amounts can increase the risk of
bacterial and protozoal infections (see &ldquo;malaria&rdquo; in
<a href="#17.11.1">Section&nbsp;17.11.1</a>
for more details). As approx&shy;imately 40% of the
popu&shy;lation in the world is exposed to malaria and it is
endemic in over&nbsp;100 countries, resolving this concern is
essential. Neuberger et&nbsp;al.

 reviewed the available
evidence based on a meta-analysis of 35&nbsp;randomized
controlled trials (31,955 children). They concluded that oral
iron supple&shy;mentation does not increase the risk of clinical
malaria provided regular malaria prevention or
management services are provided. There&shy;fore, in
resource-poor settings, routine iron supple&shy;mentation can be given to

<h3 id="17.1.7">17.1.7 Bio&shy;markers of exposure </h3>

To estimate exposure to the intake of dietary iron,
conventional dietary assessment methods must be used.
The method selected depends on several factors, including
the study objective, the setting, and available resources;
for more details, see Chapter&nbsp;3. Estimates of habitual usual
iron intakes are needed in view of the length of time
required by iron status bio&shy;markers to reach a steady state
in response to changes in dietary intakes. Usual iron
intakes are also essential to estimate the preva&shy;lence of
inadequate intakes for popu&shy;lation groups and for the
investigation of associ&shy;ations between dietary intakes and
health outcomes. Details of the statistical adjust&shy;ments for
converting observed iron intakes to usual iron intakes can also be
found in Chapter&nbsp;3. Alternatively, for large-scale
popu&shy;lation studies, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)
that is designed to assess intakes of iron-rich foods and
iron-absorp&shy;tion modifiers over a longer time period may be used,
provided the FFQ has been validated for the study setting
(see Chapter&nbsp;3, Section&nbsp;3.1.6).
<p></p>
As noted earlier, inadequate intakes of poorly available
dietary iron are a major concern in the plant-based diets of
many low-income countries. Bioavailability is defined as
the extent to which the iron is absorbed from the diet and
used for normal bodily functions

<span data-tippy-content="Lynch, S., Pfeiffer, C. M., Georgieff, M. K., Brittenham, G., Fairweather-Tait, S., Hurrell, R. F., McArdle, H. J., and Raiten, D. J. (2018). Bio&shy;markers of Nutrition for Devel&shy;opment (BOND)-Iron Review. The Journal of nutrition, 148(suppl_1), 1001S&#8209;1067S.">

Several algorithms have been developed to predict the
bioavail&shy;ability of iron based on dietary data that include
the form of the iron (i.e., heme or non&shy;heme) and the
content of known absorp&shy;tion modifiers in a meal. Of the
algorithms available, the model of Hallberg and Hulth&eacute;n

<span data-tippy-content="Hallberg, L., and Hulth&eacute;n , L. (2000). Prediction of dietary iron absorp&shy;tion: an algorithm for calculating absorp&shy;tion and bioavail&shy;ability of dietary iron. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 71(5), 1147&#8209;1160.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10799377/"
target="right" >2000</a>)</span>

is the most detailed, taking into account the effects
of all known modifiers of non&shy;heme iron absorp&shy;tion as well
as interactions, with adjust&shy;ments for the iron status of the
individual. How&shy;ever, as with all the other algorithms
developed, the model of Hallberg and Hulth&eacute;n only
predicts non&shy;heme iron absorp&shy;tion so assumptions about
the intake and absorp&shy;tion of heme iron must be made.
Further&shy;more, the model is difficult to apply, in part
because of incomplete food compo&shy;sition data for the
absorp&shy;tion modifiers. Indeed, all algorithms have
limitations and often under&shy;estimate bioavail&shy;ability, with a
3-fold variation in estimates when using dif&shy;fer&shy;ent
algorithms

In view of the limitations of the algorithms to estimate
iron bioavail&shy;ability, FAO/WHO

<span data-tippy-content="FAO/WHO (Food and Agriculture Organization / World Health Organization). (2002). Human vitamin and mineral requirements. Food and Nutrition Division, FAO, Rome.">

 have developed a
qualitative approach to estimate iron absorp&shy;tion based on
data on iron absorp&shy;tion from typical meals in Asia, India,
Latin America, and Western countries. Applying the
FAO/WHO approach, diets can be categorized as having a
low, intermediate, or high bioavail&shy;ability based on the
major food sources of iron, as shown in <a href="#box17.1">Box&nbsp;17.1</a>. The
estimates of absorp&shy;tion given
in <a href="#box17.1">Box&nbsp;17.1</a> refer to
non&shy;anemic persons with normal iron trans&shy;port (i.e., with
normal Hb) with no iron stores. When individuals
have iron defi&shy;ciency anemia,
absorp&shy;tion may be increased by 50% (i.e., increasing to
percen&shy;tages of 7.5, 15, and 22.5, respectively,
for the low-, intermediate-, and
high-bioavail&shy;ability diets). Note that for Western-type diets, FAO
and WHO now propose two categories of bioavail&shy;ability &mdash; 12% and
15% &mdash; depending on the meat content of
the diet; see Gibson and Ferguson

Recently a new approach to calculate dietary iron
bioavail&shy;ability has been developed using a probability
model. The approach is based on calculated iron
requirements, data on daily total iron intake, and the
distribution of serum ferritin values in the popu&shy;lation
sample; total iron absorp&shy;tion at any level of
iron status can be estimated

<span data-tippy-content="Dainty, J. R., Berry, R., Lynch, S. R., Harvey, L. J., and Fairweather-Tait, S. J. (2014). Estimation of dietary iron bioavail&shy;ability from food iron intake and iron status. PloS one, 9(10), e111824.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25356629/"
target="right" >Dainty et&nbsp;al., 2014</a>)</span>.

Unlike
the earlier algorithms, this new approach does not require
data on iron absorp&shy;tion modifiers or the heme content of
the diets.
<p></p>
Using the approach described above, data from a
representative group of adults from the U.K.
National Diet and Nutrition Survey were used to estimate
total iron absorp&shy;tion from a mixed Western style diet,
using a target serum ferritin concen&shy;tration of 30&micro;g/L for
iron storage status. At this level, estimates for the
predicted iron absorp&shy;tion for men and pre&shy;menopausal
women were 16% and 18%, respectively

that could be adapted for use in popu&shy;lations
con&shy;sum&shy;ing habitual plant-based diets with low-iron
bioavail&shy;ability, provided the appro&shy;priate correction for the
impact of inflam&shy;mation on serum ferritin concen&shy;trations is
performed, when necessary (see &ldquo;Acute and
chronic inflam­mation&rdquo; in
<a href="#17.7.1">Section&nbsp;17.7.1</a> for more details).
Never&shy;the&shy;less, because both the iron requirements and
dietary iron must be in a steady state for at least a year
when applying this approach, it is not suitable for certain
groups such as children, pregnant women, or immediately
after the onset of menopause.

<h3 id="17.1.8">17.1.8 Inter&shy;pretation of iron intakes </h3>

The final stage of the assessment of exposure to the
intake of iron is to evaluate the usual intakes of the popu&shy;lation or
an individual in relation to the nutrient reference values
(NRVs); see Chapter&nbsp;8a for details of the derivation of the
NRVs. To estimate the physio&shy;logical requirements for iron,
the factorial approach, based on estimates of the quantity
of absorbed iron needed to replace iron losses, is used by
most expert groups, including WHO/FAO

<span data-tippy-content="World Health Organization (2005) Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition, 2nd ed. World Health Organization.">

Next, adjust&shy;ments are made to
the estimates of physio&shy;logical requirements to yield a
dietary iron requirement (i.e., Average
Require&shy;ment; AR) by taking into account the
bioavail&shy;ability of iron in the habitual diet. The chosen
bioavail&shy;ability factors
(see Chapter&nbsp;8a, Section&nbsp;8a.8 for more details)
are partly responsible for differences in the dietary iron
requirements (i.e., ARs) across countries. There&shy;fore, care must
be taken to ensure that the dietary iron requirements
chosen for the evaluation of iron intakes are appro&shy;priate
for the habitual diet of the popu&shy;lation under study.
<p></p>
Some expert groups (e.g.,

takes into account the major food sources of
iron and the presence of potential absorp&shy;tion modifiers
can be used. Alternatively, bioavail&shy;ability can be calculated
from an appro&shy;priate iron algorithm. Inferences can then
be made about the adequacy of the iron intake of the
individual by comparing the difference between the estimate of the
usual iron intake and the corres&shy;ponding selected values for the AR

<h3 id="17.1.9">17.1.9 Introduction:
bio&shy;chem&shy;ical bio&shy;markers of iron status</h3>

In the past, iron defi&shy;ciency has been assumed to cause 50%
of all cases of anemia worldwide. The proportion is now thought to be
much lower. In a system&shy;atic review, Petry et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Petry, N., Olofin, I., Hurrell, R. F., Boy, E., Wirth, J. P., Moursi, M., Donahue Angel, M., and Rohner, F. (2016).

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27827838/"
target="right" >2016</a>)</span>

estimated that only 25% of the anemia in pre-school children,
and 39% in non-pregnant women of repro&shy;ductive age, is
attributable to iron defi&shy;ciency.
In their review, unlike in many earlier studies,
the probable exposure of a country to infection and chronic
inflam&shy;matory con&shy;ditions was taken into account.
Their findings highlighted the challenge of distin&shy;guishing between anemia
due to iron defi&shy;ciency and that due to inflam&shy;mation (i.e.,
anemia of chronic disease). This is a concern in
low-income countries and in the
elderly who are also at high risk for inflam&shy;mation
(see &ldquo;Acute and chronic inflam­mation&rdquo; in
<a href="#17.7.1">Section&nbsp;17.7.1</a>
for more details).
<p></p>
The gold standard test for the diagnosis of iron defi&shy;ciency
anemia is a stained bone marrow aspirate or biopsy. This
provides a semi-quantitative estimate of the size of the
body iron store. How&shy;ever, this test is invasive and costly,
and requires an experienced person to evaluate the stained
specimen, and so is not commonly used

<span data-tippy-content="Lynch, S., Pfeiffer, C. M., Georgieff, M. K., Brittenham, G., Fairweather-Tait, S., Hurrell, R. F., McArdle, H. J., and Raiten, D. J. (2018). Bio&shy;markers of Nutrition for Devel&shy;opment (BOND)-Iron Review. The Journal of nutrition, 148(suppl_1), 1001S&#8209;1067S.">

Instead, several hematological
parameters are used to diagnose anemia, along with
serum-based iron bio&shy;markers
and bio&shy;markers of inflam&shy;mation
to identify iron defi&shy;ciency or
iron defi&shy;ciency anemia; these are discussed in detail in the
following sections. For a summary table of each of these measures, and

Three stages in the devel&shy;opment of iron defi&shy;ciency anemia
can be recognized and are best charac&shy;ter&shy;ized by the use of
multiple bio&shy;markers
(<a href="#17.10">Section&nbsp;17.10</a>).
The three stages are the following:
<p></p>
<b>Iron depletion</b>, the first stage, is charac&shy;ter&shy;ized by
a progressive reduction in the amount of storage iron in
the liver. At this stage, the supply of iron to the functional
compartment is not compro&shy;mised so levels of trans&shy;port
iron and hemo&shy;globin are normal. How&shy;ever, the
progressive depletion of iron stores will be reflected by a
fall in serum ferritin concen&shy;trations.
<p></p>
<b>Iron-deficient erythro&shy;poiesis</b>, the second stage, is
charac&shy;ter&shy;ized by the exhaustion of iron stores and is also
referred to as “iron defi&shy;ciency without anemia”. At this
stage the iron supply to the erythropoietic cells is
progressively reduced and decreases in trans&shy;ferrin
satu&shy;ration occur
(<a href="#17.6">Section&nbsp;17.6</a>).
At the same time, there
are increases in serum trans&shy;ferrin receptor
(<a href="#17.9">Section&nbsp;17.9</a>)
and erythro&shy;cyte proto&shy;porphyrin concen&shy;trations
(<a href="#17.8">Section&nbsp;17.8</a>).
Hemo&shy;globin levels may decline slightly at
this stage, although they usually remain within the normal
range.
<p></p>
<b>Iron-defi&shy;ciency anemia</b>, the third and final stage
of iron defi&shy;ciency, is charac&shy;ter&shy;ized by the exhaustion of
iron stores, declining levels of circu&shy;lating iron, and
presence of frank micro&shy;cytic, hypo&shy;chromic anemia (i.e.,
red blood cells are small and con&shy;tain less Hb than normal).
The main feature of this stage is a reduction in Hb
(<a href="#17.2">Section&nbsp;17.2</a>),
arising from the restriction of iron supply to the bone marrow. Decreases in
the hemato&shy;crit
(<a href="#17.3">Section&nbsp;17.3</a>) and red-cell indices also occur
(<a href="#17.4">Section&nbsp;17.4</a>).
Examination of a stained blood
film allows confirm&shy;ation of the presence of hypo&shy;chromia
(a lower Hb than normal)
and micro&shy;cytosis (abnormally small red-blood cells).

<h2 id="17.2">17.2 Hemo&shy;globin</h2>

Iron is an essential compo&shy;nent of the Hb mole&shy;cule, the
oxygen-carrying pigment of red blood cells. Each Hb
mole&shy;cule is a conjugate of a protein (globin) and four
mole&shy;cules of heme, as noted earlier. Anemia develops when circu&shy;lating red
blood cells are insufficient to meet physio&shy;logical
oxygen-carrying needs, and is identified by a Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;tration
below a defined cutoff-value. Measure&shy;ment of the Hb
concen&shy;tration in whole blood is probably the most

only a subset of anemic individuals in a popu&shy;lation will

Hence, the specificity
of Hb for iron defi&shy;ciency anemia is poor. Hemo&shy;globin is
also an insen&shy;sitive measure of iron defi&shy;ciency because it
only falls during the third stage of iron defi&shy;ciency, when
iron stores are exhausted and the supply of iron to the
tissues is compro&shy;mised. In addition, considerable overlap
exists in the Hb values of normal non&shy;anemic and
iron-deficient individuals, further reducing its sensitivity for
screening for iron defi&shy;ciency.

Conse&shy;quently, Hb should not
be used as the only measure of iron defi&shy;ciency anemia in
individuals, except in very specific circumstances
(<a href="#17.2.4">Section&nbsp;17.2.4</a>).
Limi&shy;tations of using Hb as a measure of
iron defi&shy;ciency are discussed below.

Hemo­globin values tend to be lower in the evening than in the
morning, by amounts of up to 10g/L. Within-subject
day-to-day variation is low (CV&asymp;3%)
(<a href="#table17.4">Table&nbsp;17.4</a>).

than any other time in life, reflecting fetal adaption to the oxygen-
deficient environment of the uterus. After birth, Hb
concen&shy;trations fall, reaching their lowest point at about 2mos
This fall is probably due to the
sudden decrease in erythro&shy;poiesis arising from the
increase in oxygen delivery to the tissues

Around the fifth decade of life, Hb
levels decline. Several factors have been implicated in this
decline, including the devel&shy;opment of anemia of chronic
disease with aging.
<p></p>
<b>Sex </b> differences in Hb are apparent at 6mos, with boys
having slightly lower Hb
concen&shy;trations than girls. Such discrepancies appear to be
greater in infants with a
birth weight &lt;&nbsp;3500g

By the second decade of life, how&shy;ever,
females have values that change very little after 12y

(<a href="#table17.5">Table&nbsp;17.5</a>).
<a id="table17.5"></a>
In young adults, the Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;tration for men is on
average about 20g/L higher than for women, due to
testosterone which results in both a larger body size and
larger erythro&shy;cyte mass.





For women, the trend for lower
Hb values is due to chronic menstrual blood loss. These
sex-related differences, although diminishing gradually
with increasing age, remain
(<a href="#table17.5">Table&nbsp;17.5</a>).

<b>Cigarette smoking</b> is associated with higher
concen&shy;trations of Hb <span class="n">(0.3&#8209;0.7g/L)</span> in adults. This is attributed
to a reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood
arising from the carbon monoxide-induced increase in
carboxy&shy;hemo&shy;globin levels, which has no oxygen-carrying
capacity. An adjust&shy;ment to define anemia for smokers has
been defined by the U.S.&nbsp;CDC based on U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;II data
(see
<a href="#table17.6">Table&nbsp;17.6</a>).

<a id="table17.6"></a>

The adjust&shy;ments should be subtracted from the measured values.
These adjust&shy;ments are additive so
that if smokers are living at higher altitudes (see below),
two adjust&shy;ments would be needed.

<b>Higher altitudes</b> generate an adaptive response

<b>Iron-defi&shy;ciency anemia</b> develops during the third
stage of iron defi&shy;ciency. At this stage, iron stores are
exhausted, the supply of iron to support the produc&shy;tion of
red blood cells is compro&shy;mised, and as a conse&shy;quence Hb
concen&shy;tration decreases. Iron-defi&shy;ciency anemia is
charac&shy;ter&shy;ized by micro&shy;cytic, hypo&shy;chromic anemia.
Considerable overlap exists in the Hb
values of normal non&shy;anemic and iron-deficient individuals,
noted earlier, which further decreases the sensitivity of Hb
measure&shy;ments

<b>Preg&shy;nancy</b> results in an expansion of both plasma
volume and the red-cell volume. Near the end of the
second trimester of preg&shy;nancy, the increase in plasma
volume is not matched by a propor&shy;tionate increase in red
cells, so Hb becomes even more diluted.
In women who are not taking iron supple&shy;ments, the

leading to a fall in Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations and the devel&shy;opment of iron
defi&shy;ciency anemia in some individuals. This is not
surprising as 1mL of blood con&shy;tains 0.5mg of iron, so a
single donation of 450mL blood will con&shy;tain nearly 250mg
of iron. There&shy;fore, if blood is donated thrice yearly,
nearly 1g iron annually will be lost. Currently,
iron supple&shy;mentation for blood donors is often not a standard

regular blood donors in India, for example, body iron
stores were inversely proportional to the lifetime number
of donations, is not unex&shy;pected

<b>Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)</b> is a
normo&shy;chromic, normo&shy;cytic anemia
(i.e., the average size and Hb content of
red cells are within normal limits) with
character&shy;istically mild (90g/L) to moderate (80g/L)
Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations.
It can result from a variety of dif&shy;fer&shy;ent conditions. Acute
and chronic infections such as malaria, tuberculosis,
bacterial infection and HIV/AIDS as well as inflam&shy;matory
con&shy;ditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or malignancy can
all lead to the anemia of chronic disease. All these con&shy;ditions
induce the acute-phase response whereby
pro-inflam&shy;matory cytokines (e.g., IL&#8209;6 and leptin)
stimulate the release of hepatic
hepcidin into the circu&shy;lation. Hepcidin in turn,
blocks the release of iron into the
circu&shy;lation from storage sites (e.g., reticulo-endothelial
cells) independent of iron status, resulting in an increase in serum
ferritin. At the same time, hepcidin inhibits iron
absorp&shy;tion. As a conse&shy;quence,
serum iron levels fall, the iron available for erythro&shy;poiesis
is reduced, and Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations decline

<b>Malaria</b> parasites cause low Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations
and thus anemia by: (a) increased hemolysis with erythrocyte
destruction of both infected and non-infected red
cells; (b) suppression of red blood cell formation
(i.e., suppressed erythro&shy;poiesis) by the action of hemozoin,
a product of Hb catab&shy;olized by the parasites; and
(c) induction of the acute phase response
and the subsequent up&shy;reg&shy;ulation of hepcidin.

<b>Intestinal parasitic infections</b> such as Helminths
(e.g., hookworms: <i>Necator americanus</i> and <i>Ancylostoma

anemia due to chronic gastro&shy;intestinal blood loss.
Hookworms become attached to the mucosa of the upper
small intestine and feed on blood which is
subsequently expelled through the intestinal tract of the
hook worm. Secondary blood loss may also occur from
bleeding of the damaged intestinal mucosa

 <b>Genetic hemo&shy;globin disorders </b> can cause low Hb
concen&shy;trations and anemia. They are classified as
thalassemias when there is impaired synthesis of
Hb&nbsp;chains. Alternatively, in structural Hb&nbsp;variants
(i.e. hemo&shy;globin&shy;opathies), defective Hb&nbsp;chains
result from genetic alterations in the physical structure of Hb.
The clinical features of genetic&nbsp;Hb
disorders vary with the severity of the genetic defect and
their effect on the structure and function of Hb. Some
present as mild-to-severe anemia, whereas others are
associated with multiple clinical complications that may
sometimes be severe enough to cause death <i>in&nbsp;utero</i>

Genetic disorders of red-cell enzymes are also associated
with the risk of anemia, the most frequent being
glucose-6-phos&shy;phate dehydro&shy;genase defi&shy;ciency (G6PD). This
disorder renders red-blood cells susceptible to chronic, or
acute intermit&shy;tent, hemolytic anemia under some

<h3 id="17.2.2">17.2.2 Interpretive criteria &mdash; use of the
distribution of hemoglobin reference values </h3>

At the popu&shy;lation level, Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations can be
evaluated by comparison with a distribution of Hb reference values using percentiles.
The reference values are obtained from a
cross-sectional analysis of a reference sample group, which in most cases consists of
an apparently &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; popu&shy;lation
sampled during a nationally representative survey
and assumed to be disease-free. Conse&shy;quently,
some of the participants in the sample will have
Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations lower than normal because
they are affected by some of the factors, discussed above, known
to influence Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations.
Nevertheless, such reference distributions are often
used as a standard for comparison with the
Hb&nbsp;distribution measured in a study popu&shy;lation.

Individuals in a popu&shy;lation can be classified
as &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; by comparing Hb
concen&shy;trations with either statistically pre&shy;deter&shy;mined
reference limits drawn from the reference distribution,
or clinically or functionally defined &ldquo;cutoff values&rdquo;.

For Hb, where a single reference limit has been defined,
in most cases this has been set at the 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;percentile
of a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;
reference distribution or one in which the
population sampled are assumed to be
disease free, as noted in
<a href="#17.2.2">Section&nbsp;17.2.2.</a>
Technically, a statistically defined
reference limit is not a &ldquo;cutoff value&rdquo;
because it has not been linked with physio&shy;logical
or health outcomes, so these two terms should not
be used interchangeably. Nevertheless, invariably,
the term &ldquo;cutoff values&rdquo; is applied
irrespective of the method used to define them.

of nutritional bio&shy;markers.

The inter&shy;survey variance around the
Hb 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;percentile was low (3.5% for women and 3.6% for children)
supporting the approp&shy;riateness of pooling multi&shy;national
Hb data to derive a single-population group
specific 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;percentile cutoff.
The pooled 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;percentile estimates for
apparently &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; individuals were: 96.5g/L (95% CI,
92.6&#8209;100.4g/L) for children aged 6&#8209;59mos,
and 108.1g/L (95% CI, 103.5&#8209;112.7g/L) for nonpregnant women aged
15&#8209;49y, both lower than the

estimates for these age groups shown in
<a href="#table17.7">Table&nbsp;17.7</a>.
Moreover, when the Hb fell below
96.1g/L for the children and below 110.1g/L
for the women there was a compen&shy;satory increase in erythro&shy;poiesis, as
indicated by a plot of Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations against
sTfR (a bio&shy;marker of tissue iron defi&shy;ciency and a physio&shy;logical
indicator of erythropoiesis) (<a href="#17.9">Section&nbsp;17.9</a>).
Nevertheless, the invest&shy;igators highlight the need for more studies
based on clinical outcomes to further confirm the validity of these revised Hb
cutoffs for anemia for these two age groups; see Addo et&nbsp;al.

 This simplified approach is designed to assess the
preva&shy;lence and etiology of anemia, based solely on
Hb, and is especially useful when it is not feasible
to use multiple bio&shy;chem&shy;ical tests for iron status because of
cost or operational constraints. It is also useful in
developing countries where factors other than inadequate
intakes of dietary iron, such as parasitic infections and
genetic Hb disorders, often affect red cell produc&shy;tion and
thus interfere with the inter&shy;pretation of iron status
measures.

reference samples. These distributions can be used as a
standard for comparison with the Hb
distributions from other surveys.
<p></p>
If anemia is prevalent in the target popu&shy;lation then the
Hb distribution will be shifted to the left relative to the reference.
The distribution approach can also indicate when inadequate dietary intake
of iron is the main factor causing iron defi&shy;ciency in a
popu&shy;lation. If this is the case, then the Hb
distributions for children and women are both
affected. Both subgroups will have
signif&shy;icantly lower median Hb values when
compared with their respective reference distributions,
whereas the median of the distribution for adult men in the target popu&shy;lation is
virtually unaffected. For example, comparison of the
Hb distributions for school-aged children

U.S.&nbsp;reference sample for African Americans shows a
marked shift of Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations
(<a href="#figure17.6">Figure&nbsp;17.6</a>).
In Zanzibar, the decreased Hb levels were related to
gastro&shy;intestinal blood loss as a result of hookworm

The method involves converting all of the usually encountered
forms of Hb (oxyhemo&shy;globin, methemo&shy;globin,
and carboxy&shy;hemo&shy;globin) to cyanmet-hemo&shy;globin. The
analysis is then normally performed with a

Alternatively, Hb is best measured using a Coulter Counter
using EDTA-anti&shy;coagulated blood. Most automated cell
counter analyzers use the cyanmet&shy;hemo&shy;globin method.
A portable hemo&shy;globin photometer can be used for
popu&shy;lation assessment in remote field settings. The
&ldquo;HemoCue&rdquo; is battery operated and uses a dry reagent
(sodium azide) in a microcuvette for direct blood collection

As described for Hb, hematocrit concen&shy;trations decline steadily during
preg&shy;nancy as a result of a greater increase in plasma
volume relative to the increase in red blood cell mass,
reaching a nadir at about <span class="n">28&#8209;36wks</span> in women not taking
iron supple&shy;ments. How&shy;ever, the hematocrit is
only useful if Hb&nbsp;values are not available.
<p></p>
In iron defi&shy;ciency, the hematocrit falls after Hb
formation has become impaired. As a result, in early cases
of moderate iron defi&shy;ciency, a marginally low Hb
value may be associated with a nearly normal hematocrit

<div class="box">
<b>Box&nbsp;17.2: Limitations of the hematocrit determination</b>
<ul class="no-padding" style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>
Poor sensitivity as hematocrit falls only in the
third stage of iron defi&shy;ciency
<li>
Poor specificity, as hematocrit is affected by the same
factors that influence Hb
<li>
Poor precision, particularly when capillary blood
samples are used

</ul>
</div>
Hematocrit, like Hb, is usually determined on
EDTA&#8209;anti&shy;coagulated blood from a venipuncture or
capillary blood. The measure&shy;ment is relatively easy, rapid,
and often used in screening for iron-defi&shy;ciency anemia,
although the technical errors for the measure&shy;ment of
hematocrit are greater than for Hb.
Measure&shy;ment errors may result from:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>
Poorly packed iron-deficient cells, resulting in
spuriously elevated values
<li>
Improper mixing of blood caused by intermittent
blood flow from the puncture site
<li>
Excessive anticoagulant in the collection tube (e.g., if
collection tube is not filled with blood)
<li>
Dilution of blood by an alcohol solution because the
finger was not dried before it was punctured
<li>
Elevated white blood cell counts, leading to a poorly
defined boundary between erythro&shy;cytes and plasma
in the hematocrit tube.

<h3 id="17.3.2">17.3.2 Measure&shy;ment of hematocrit</h3>

Hematocrit can be measured manually by centrifuging a
small amount of blood in a heparin&shy;ized capillary tube
until the red cells have been reduced to a constant packed
cell volume. The hematocrit is calculated by comparing the
height of the column of packed red cells with the height of
the entire column of red cells and plasma, and expressed
as the volume percen&shy;tage or volume fraction of packed red blood cells.
How&shy;ever, values measured in this way frequently have
poor reproducibility, especially when the power supply is
unstable and the equipment not well standardized

Alternatively, hematocrit can be derived using automated
electronic cell counters. These measure mean cell volume
(MCV) and the number of red blood cells from which
hematocrit is calculated as MCV&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;RBC concen&shy;tration.
Hematocrit values generated in this way tend to be about
1% higher than those generated manually

<h2 id="17.4">17.4 Red-cell indices</h2>

Red-cell indices are derived from measure&shy;ments of
Hb, hematocrit, and red-blood cell count. They
can indicate cell size and the concen&shy;tration of
Hb within the cell allowing dif&shy;fer&shy;ent types of
anemia to be diagnosed. Fresh samples of whole
anti&shy;coagulated blood are required. The accuracy,
precision, and use of red-cell indices have increased with
the growing availability of automated electronic
cell-counting instruments.
<p></p>
Red-cell indices lack specificity. If subnormal values are
noted in the absence of thalassemia trait, anemia of
chronic disease, and other known causal con&shy;ditions,
additional measures of iron status are recom&shy;mended to
confirm the diagnosis of iron defi&shy;ciency. The confirmatory
tests commonly used are serum iron and total iron-binding
capacity, serum ferritin, erythro&shy;cyte proto&shy;porphyrin, and
more recently, soluble trans&shy;ferrin receptor (sTfR). These tests are
discussed in

indices during iron-defi&shy;ciency anemia, macrocytic anemia
resulting from vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> or
folic acid defi&shy;ciency, and
the anemia of chronic disease. The latter arises from
inflam&shy;mation due to infectious diseases (as noted earlier in
&ldquo;Acute and chronic inflam­mation&rdquo; in
<a href="#17.2.1">Section&nbsp;17.2.1</a>),
when pro-inflam&shy;matory
cytokines stimulate the produc&shy;tion of hepcidin. This in
turn reduces both the absorp&shy;tion of dietary iron and the
release of iron from body stores and from macrophages
(which recycle iron from senescent erythro&shy;cytes). If the
inflam&shy;matory con&shy;dition persists, the supply of iron
available for erythro&shy;poiesis is reduced, and anemia may
develop

Changes in red-cell indices during vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> and folic acid
defi&shy;ciency are described in more detail in Chapter&nbsp;22. In
iron-defi&shy;ciency anemia, the fall in Hb is followed
by a fall in mean cell volume (MCV), then mean cell
Hb (MCH), and finally mean cell Hb
concen&shy;tration (MCHC). With the widespread use of
automated hematology analyzers, MCV has become a
key red&nbsp;cell parameter used to classify anemia
(<a href="#table17.12">Table&nbsp;17.12</a>),
although seldom used in the diagnosis of iron defi&shy;ciency
today.
<p></p>
Reference ranges derived from U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III stratified by
nine age groups, sex and racial categories are available,
based on MCV, MCH, MCHC, and red-cell distribution
width (RDW). These are based on Coulter Counter data in which rigorous criteria
were applied to exclude individuals with evidence of acute
or chronic disease. Representative plots for each red-cell

<h3 id="17.4.1">17.4.1 Mean cell volume</h3>

Mean cell volume or mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a
measure of the average size of the red blood cells
expressed in femtoliters (fL). Cells may be abnormally
large (macro&shy;cytosis), as in vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> or folic acid
defi&shy;ciency, or abnormally small (micro&shy;cytosis), as in iron
and vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub> defi&shy;ciency. Mean cell volume is best
determined directly with a Coulter Counter as results
obtained in this way are highly reproducible. Reported
within-subject biological variation for MCV is low, varying
between 0.6 and 1.3%

<span data-tippy-content="Buttarello M. (2016). Laboratory diagnosis of anemia: are the old and new red-cell parameters useful in classification and treatment, how?. International journal of laboratory hematology, 38 Suppl 1, 123&#8209;132.">

If a Coulter Counter is not available, MCV can be calculated from the
hematocrit and the red blood cell count determined manually

\[\small \mbox{MCV (fL) = }\frac{\mbox{hematocrit (volume fraction})}{ \mbox{ red blood cell count }(10^{12}/\mbox{L})}\]

Mean cell volume is less affected by sampling errors in skin
puncture capillary blood samples than Hb,
because red-cell size is unaffected if the sample is diluted
by the interstitial fluid.
<p></p>
A low MCV value only occurs when iron defi&shy;ciency is
severe. It is a relatively specific index for iron-defi&shy;ciency
anemia, provided that the anemia of chronic disease,
certain genetic Hb disorders (&alpha;&#8209;&nbsp;and &beta;&#8209;thalassemias including hetero&shy;zygotes), and lead poisoning
are excluded. In macrocytic anemias associated with
 vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> or folate defi&shy;ciency, MCV values are high
(<a href="#table17.12">Table&nbsp;17.12</a>).
In preg&shy;nancy, MCV decreases slightly
between 26 and 38wks gestation, likely attributed to the transfer
of placental iron being most intense at this time, thus
decreasing the iron availability for maternal erythro&shy;poiesis

Spuriously high values for MCV may be apparent as a

level of sodium in the blood).

The MCV increases progressively from 6mos to early adulthood

than in males. Individuals of African descent have lower

Mean cell hemo&shy;globin (MCH) is the mean Hb
content of individual red blood cells, and provides
information that is comparable to that of MCV. It is derived
from the ratio of Hb to the red blood cell count:<br>

\[\small \mbox{MCH (pg) &equals; }\frac{\mbox{hemo&shy;globin (g/L})}{ \mbox{ red blood cell count }(10^{12}/\mbox{L})}\]

popu&shy;lation based on the U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III survey from
which composite reference intervals for MCH according to
age and race, classified by sex were obtained; race-related
trends in MCH were apparent.
The MCH changed progressively from infancy to
adulthood, when values ranged from <span class="n">27&#8209;32pg.</span> The MCH
changes in iron-defi&shy;ciency anemia are similar to those for
MCV; MCH is low in iron-defi&shy;ciency anemia but high in the

defi&shy;ciency
(<a href="#table17.12">Table&nbsp;17.12</a>).
In the latter, the red blood cells are

<h3 id="17.4.3">17.4.3 Mean cell hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;tration</h3>

If both the Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;tration and the hematocrit
are known, the concen&shy;tration of Hb in the red
blood cells can be determined. This is known as the mean
cell hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;tration (MCHC) and is calculated
as:

\[\small \mbox {MCHC (g/L)} &equals; \frac {\mbox {hemo&shy;globin (g/L)} }{\mbox {hematocrit (vol. fraction) }}\]

The MCHC is normally determined with a Coulter
Counter, although manual determinations are possible.
After the first few months of life, MCHC is less affected by
age than any other red-cell index

<h2 id="17.5">17.5 Red-cell distribution width</h2>

RDW is a measure of the
variation in red-cell size (i.e., aniso&shy;cytosis). It is normally
expressed as the percen&shy;tage coefficient of variation of the
mean cell volume:

 \[\small \mbox {RDW (%)} = \frac{\mbox {SD of MCV (fL) &times; 100%}}{\mbox {MCV(fL)}}\]

The RDW can be determined routinely as part of a
complete blood count on many Coulter Counters. Some counters output only the standard
deviation as the measure of RDW.

RDW increases in iron-defi&shy;ciency
anemia and was included as a marker of iron status in the

classified anemic

high MCV and two categories of RDW &mdash; normal (&lt;&nbsp;15.1%)

numerous reported exceptions to this classification,
together with differences in the reference intervals for the

Clearly, a high RDW is not specific for iron defi&shy;ciency. High
values also occur in folate or vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> defi&shy;ciency and
when iron and folate, or iron and vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> deficiencies
coexist. Also, in some genetic Hb disorders (e.g. in
S&nbsp;&beta;&#8209;thalassemia, sickle cell disease (SS), and sickle cell trait
(SC), RDW is elevated, whereas in the anemia of chronic
disease, RDW is normal. The inter&shy;pretation of
RDW is further complicated by the wide distribution of RDW
values within a specific disease, and the discrepancy in
cutoffs using Coulter Counters from dif&shy;fer&shy;ent manufacturers

<a id="table17.14"></a>
<p></p>
<b>Serum iron</b> represents the fraction of iron that
circulates bound to the iron trans&shy;port protein, trans&shy;ferrin.
The iron in the serum is derived mostly from iron recycled
from catabolized red blood cells in the reticulo-endothelial
system, with a concen&shy;tration that normally ranges from
<span class="n">8.9&#8209;21.5&micro;mol/L</span>
<span class="n">(50&#8209;120&micro;g/dL).</span>
Almost all the iron in the serum is bound to
trans&shy;ferrin; non-trans&shy;ferrin
bound iron (NTBI) usually comprises &lt;&nbsp;1% of the total iron
pool in the serum (see
<a href="#17.11.3">Section&nbsp;17.11.3</a> for details of NTBI).
<p></p>
In the fasting state, serum iron levels reflect the fraction of
iron that circulates bound principally to trans&shy;ferrin and
which is in transit from the reticulo-endo&shy;thelial system
to the bone marrow. After a meal, concen&shy;trations of
serum iron rise due to the release of iron absorbed by
entero&shy;cytes into the plasma pool. Hence, at this time, the
measure&shy;ment of serum iron will be repre&shy;sentative of iron
absorp&shy;tion. Serum iron is reduced by infection and
inflam&shy;mation.
<p></p>
 <b>Serum trans&shy;ferrin</b> is the trans&shy;port protein for serum
iron. Theoretically each mole&shy;cule of
trans&shy;ferrin <span class="n">(MW &asymp;&nbsp;80kDa)</span> is capable of binding to two
moles of iron <span class="n">(MW &asymp;&nbsp;55.8kDa).</span>
When iron stores are exhausted, and serum iron concen&shy;trations
are <span class="n">&lt;&nbsp;40&#8209;60&micro;g/dL,</span> serum
trans&shy;ferrin increases in response to an
increase in iron absorp&shy;tion. Hence, serum trans&shy;ferrin does not identify iron
defi&shy;ciency during the first stage of iron defi&shy;ciency
(i.e., iron depletion); for more details see Elsayed et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Elsayed, M. E., Sharif, M. U., and Stack, A. G. (2016). Trans&shy;ferrin Saturation: A Body Iron Bio&shy;marker. Advances in clinical chemistry, 75, 71&#8209;97.">

target="right" >2016</a>)</span>.


<p></p>
<b>Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)</b> measures the
total number of binding sites for iron atoms on trans&shy;ferrin.
Hence, serum TIBC is closely related to, and often used as
a proxy measure of, trans&shy;ferrin, rising once the iron stores
are exhausted due to an increase in trans&shy;ferrin synthesis in
response to increased iron absorp&shy;tion.
Unlike serum iron, TIBC is not subject to rapid changes
in concen&shy;tration either within individuals or from
day-to-day (i.e., circadian variation).
<p></p>
<b>Trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration (as percent)</b> is an estimate
of the percen&shy;tage of the two iron binding sites on all
trans&shy;ferrin mole&shy;cules that are occupied with iron.
Trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration measures the iron supply to the
erythroid bone marrow: as the iron supply decreases, the
serum iron concen&shy;tration falls and the satu&shy;ration of
trans&shy;ferrin decreases. Serum iron and TIBC are usually
determined at the same time, so trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration is
calculated as the ratio of serum iron to total iron binding
capacity as shown below:

\[\small \mbox {Trans&shy;ferrin Sat. (%)} = \frac {\mbox {Serum iron (&micro;mol/L)}}{\mbox {TIBC (&micro;mol/L)}}\mbox { &times; 100%}\]

Trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration can also be determined if
unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UBIC) and serum iron are measured. In
this case, TIBC is determined from the sum of serum iron
and UIBC.

\[\small \mbox {TIBC (&micro;mol/L) = UIBC (&micro;mol/L) &plus;
	Serum iron (&micro;mol/L)}\]

Then

\[\small \mbox {Trans&shy;ferrin Sat. (%)} = \frac {\mbox {Serum iron
	(&micro;mol/L)}}{\mbox {TIBC (&micro;mol/L)}}\mbox { &times; 100%}\]

Alternatively, trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration can be calculated from
the ratio of serum iron to serum trans&shy;ferrin

Trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration was one of the multiple iron
bio&shy;markers in the &ldquo;ferritin model&rdquo; employed in
the U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;II and U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III
surveys (see <a href="#17.10">Section&nbsp;17.10</a>).
In healthy individuals, trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration (as percen&shy;tage)
usually ranges from <span class="n">20&#8209;45%.</span>
Levels &lt;&nbsp;15%&nbsp;satu&shy;ration indicate
that the rate of delivery of iron to the
developing erythro&shy;cytes is insufficient to maintain normal
Hb&nbsp;synthesis, and hence are an early indicator of
suboptimal iron supply. A prolonged period of time with
trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration below 15%, results in iron deficient
erythro&shy;poiesis which leads to changes in the number and
shape of newly released reticulo&shy;cytes and erythro&shy;cytes

Never&shy;the&shy;less, low trans&shy;ferrin
satu&shy;ration levels are not specific for iron defi&shy;ciency, as
discussed below.

<h3 id="17.6.1">17.6.1 Factors affecting serum iron, TIBC, serum
trans&shy;ferrin, and trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration</h3>

<b>Biological variation</b> for serum iron may be quite
large, resulting in large daily variation in trans&shy;ferrin
satu&shy;ration: coefficients of variation among individuals for serum or plasma
iron may exceed 30% &mdash; mainly as a result of variation in
the release of iron from the reticulo&shy;endothelial system to
the plasma. As a result, more than one
sample is needed for a clinical evaluation.
<a href="#table17.4">Table&nbsp;17.4</a>
compares the overall variability of serum iron with Hb and
serum ferritin as indicated by within-subject, day-to-day
coefficient of variation (as&nbsp;%) for healthy subjects.
In contrast, serum trans&shy;ferrin concen&shy;trations are steadier.
 <p></p>
In general, values for serum iron and thus trans&shy;ferrin
satu&shy;ration tend to be elevated in the morning (about 35%,
ranging from <span class="n">20&#8209;55%)</span> but decrease in the afternoon and evening.
As a result, measure&shy;ments should be determined on
fasting morning blood samples. In this way, the effects of
both recent dietary intake and diurnal variation are
minimized. Note that among night-shift workers, the
pattern of diurnal variation may be reversed

TIBC is less subject to biological variation than is serum
iron as noted earlier, but it is more susceptible to
analytical errors. Day-to-day variation is about <span class="n">8&#8209;12%</span>

The large biological variation for serum iron
has obvious implications for its use at both the popu&shy;lation and
individual levels. Further&shy;more, these limitations highlight
the importance of using multiple indices of iron status to
provide a more valid assessment of iron status than any
single measure&shy;ment (<a href="#17.10">Section&nbsp;17.10</a>).
<p></p>
In U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III, the large diurnal variation for serum iron is
reflected in the results for trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration shown in
<a href="#figure17.9">Figure&nbsp;17.9</a>.
This measure was included in U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;II and&nbsp;III in
the earlier MCV and ferritin models used to assess iron
status, but has now been abandoned.

<b>Age-related changes</b> in serum iron and serum trans&shy;ferrin
are marked. Serum iron and trans&shy;ferrin levels
rise during childhood until about the second decade of life

<b>Iron defi&shy;ciency</b> uncom&shy;plicated by the
inflam&shy;matory response, leads first to a gradual reduction
in iron stores, that once exhausted, results in a fall in
serum iron levels. The low serum iron (and serum ferritin)
levels down-regulate hepcidin synthesis, thus promoting iron
absorp&shy;tion and greater iron release from storage sites into
the circu&shy;lation. As a conse&shy;quence, serum trans&shy;ferrin
increases to enhance the delivery of iron to the bone
marrow to maintain effective erythro&shy;poiesis, so TIBC rises,
resulting in a low trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration


<span data-tippy-content="Elsayed, M. E., Sharif, M. U., and Stack, A. G. (2016). Trans&shy;ferrin Saturation: A Body Iron Bio&shy;marker. Advances in clinical chemistry, 75, 71&#8209;97.">

<a href="#table17.14">Table&nbsp;17.14</a>).
<p></p>
Because these changes appear during the second stage of
iron defi&shy;ciency &mdash; termed iron deficient erythro&shy;poiesis &mdash; when
iron stores are exhausted, trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration is a
more sensitive index of iron status than the red-cell indices
discussed earlier in <a href="#17.4">Section&nbsp;17.4</a>,
but less sensitive than
serum ferritin
(<a href="#17.7">Section&nbsp;17.7</a>).
Trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration is
more consistently useful for diagnosing iron defi&shy;ciency
than either serum iron or total TIBC alone: a low
trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration in associ&shy;ation with an elevated TIBC
is specific for iron defi&shy;ciency. Never&shy;the&shy;less, because of the
diurnal variation in levels, and the confounding effect of
inflam&shy;mation (see below), percen&shy;tage trans&shy;ferrin
satu&shy;ration is not a suitable bio&shy;marker for popu&shy;lation
surveys.
<p></p>
<b>Oral contraceptive agents and estrogen replacement
therapy </b>(i.e., con&shy;ditions of estrogen excess) may lead
to an increase in trans&shy;ferrin synthesis that is independent
of body iron status. Levels of TIBC are also elevated,
similar to those observed in iron defi&shy;ciency

<p></p>
<b>Preg&shy;nancy</b> leads to a steady decline in serum iron
as the plasma volume expands, whereas serum trans&shy;ferrin
concen&shy;tration increases, resulting in a decrease in
trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration.
Because of these rapid changes during preg&shy;nancy, serum iron and
trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration are rarely used for
diagnosing iron defi&shy;ciency in preg&shy;nancy

<span data-tippy-content="Fisher, A. L., and Nemeth, E. (2017). Iron homeo&shy;stasis during preg&shy;nancy. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 106(Suppl 6), 1567S&#8209;1574S.">

The magnitude of these changes is
less in women sup&shy;ple&shy;mented with iron during preg&shy;nancy.
<p></p>
<b>Iron overload</b> results in an elevated body iron
store and, thus, a high serum iron (and ferritin) level
because of excessive absorp&shy;tion of iron and
because there is no regulatory mech&shy;anism for controlling
iron excretion. As a conse&shy;quence, serum trans&shy;ferrin is
reduced, TIBC falls, and trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration level is
elevated
(<a href="#table17.14">Table&nbsp;17.14</a>,

<span data-tippy-content="Pfeiffer, C. M., and Looker, A. C. (2017). Laboratory methodologies for indicators of iron status: strengths, limitations, and analytical challenges. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 106(Suppl 6), 1606S&#8209;1614S.">

In earlier U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III surveys, a trans&shy;ferrin
satu&shy;ration level &gt;&nbsp;70% was the criterion for
detecting iron overload in adults. How&shy;ever, to detect iron overload today,
WHO advises the inclusion of trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration
and serum ferritin, plus details on known genetic and
clinical risk factors

The most common genetic risk factor for iron overload is
hereditary hemo&shy;chrom&shy;atosis, with a worldwide preva&shy;lence in Caucasian
popu&shy;lations of <span class="n">3.5&#8209;4.5</span> per&nbsp;1000 popu&shy;lation.
It is more common in males. Clinical risk factors for
othertypes of iron overload include hemolytic anemia, chronic liver
disease, long-term transfusion therapy for
genetic Hb disorders, and African iron overload

<p></p>
<b>Anemia of chronic disease</b> is associated with
infectious diseases (see <a href="#17.2.1">Section&nbsp;17.2.1</a>)
that induce the acute-phase response, the local reaction
of which is inflam&shy;mation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines promote the
release of hepatic hepcidin which in turn blocks the release of
iron from the body stores into the circu&shy;lation
(independent of iron status) and inhibits absorp&shy;tion of dietary iron.
There&shy;fore, iron is no longer available for trans&shy;port to the
bone marrow for erythro&shy;poiesis. Conse&shy;quently,
concen&shy;trations of both serum iron and serum
trans&shy;ferrin fall, so levels of TIBC are low. Hence,
percen&shy;tage trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration is decreased, a response
primarily reflecting the decreased serum iron levels.
There&shy;fore, serum trans&shy;ferrin acts as a negative acute phase
protein, decreasing in the anemia of chronic disease,
whereas in iron defi&shy;ciency anemia, serum trans&shy;ferrin
concen&shy;trations are increased
(<a href="#table17.14">Table&nbsp;17.14</a>).
<p></p>
The rate at which serum iron concen&shy;trations return to
normal after the acute phase response varies among
individuals, sometimes normalizing with <span class="n">24&#8209;48hrs</span> of an
acute infection. In contrast, during chronic inflam&shy;matory
states such as arthritis, serum iron levels may remain low
for a prolonged period of time, thus decreasing the
availability of iron to cells leading to the anemia of chronic
disease. Such variability in the response causes
uncertainty in the inter&shy;pretation of serum iron in inflam&shy;mation

 confirm both a higher plasma volume and the presence of
adiposity-related inflam&shy;mation in the overweight / obese (OW/OB)
women (BMI <span class="n">25&#8209;39.9kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> compared
to their normal-weight peers (BMI <span class="n">18.5&#8209;24.9kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</span>
Note the elevated serum concen&shy;trations and total mass of IL-6 levels
in the OW/OB women. These higher levels stimulate an increase in circu&shy;lating hepcidin
which, in turn, is likely to impair iron absorp&shy;tion, and
induce the hypoferremia (i.e., low serum iron levels)
observed in the OW/OB women compared to their normal weight peers

There is also an increase in Hb
mass (i.e., total Hb in g) in OW/OB women, thus
increasing their iron requirements for erythro&shy;poiesis and
contributing to the increased risk for iron defi&shy;ciency in
OW/OB women.
<p></p>
<b>Decreased erythro&shy;poiesis</b> reduces the demand
for iron for Hb synthesis, so levels of serum iron
remain at normal or slightly above normal levels, and TIBC
is normal or low. Conse&shy;quently, trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration may
be high. This con&shy;dition occurs with chronic renal failure,
and aplastic anemia as well as with
the action of certain drugs and toxins.
<p></p>
<b>Increased erythro&shy;poiesis</b> occurs in con&shy;ditions in
which there is an increased demand for iron for
Hb synthesis. Conse&shy;quently, serum iron concen&shy;trations fall
below normal limits, whereas TIBC is often high-normal or
even high, and levels of circu&shy;lating serum trans&shy;ferrin
increase. These same trends occur in iron defi&shy;ciency, so
additional measures of iron status (e.g., serum ferritin)
should be used to distin&shy;guish between increased
erythro&shy;poiesis and iron defi&shy;ciency.
Increased erythro&shy;poiesis occurs during the stages of the
life cycle when needs for iron are increased, such as growth and
preg&shy;nancy, after recovery from bone marrow depression,
in response to vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> and folate therapy, hypoxia,
and sometimes in polycy&shy;themia.
<p></p>
<b>Hemolysis</b> leads to falsely elevated serum iron
concen&shy;trations because the concen&shy;tration of iron in red
blood cells is higher than that of serum. There&shy;fore,
hemolyzed serum samples should not be used for the
measure&shy;ment of serum iron.

An indirect method can also be used to calculate TIBC. In this method, serum is
incubated at near neutral pH with a pre&shy;deter&shy;mined
amount of Fe<sup>3+</sup> that saturates all the available free sites
on serum trans&shy;ferrin. A chromogen is then added to
complex with the free unbound iron, and as the total
amount of iron added is known, UIBC can be measured.
TIBC is then calculated based on the sum of UIBC and
serum iron as shown in <a href="#17.6">Section&nbsp;17.6</a>.

<h2 id="17.7">17.7 Serum ferritin</h2>

Ferritin was first identified in human serum by Addison et
al.

 where it represents only a small fraction of the
body's ferritin pool. Its function in the serum is unknown.
Ferritin appears to enter the serum by secretions from
hepatocytes or specialized macrophages

 The ferritin mole&shy;cule consists of an intracellular hollow
protein shell composed of 24&nbsp;subunits that surrounds an
iron core con&shy;taining <span class="n">4000&#8209;4500 iron</span> atoms

<span data-tippy-content="WHO (2020) Serum ferritin concentrations for the assessment of iron status in

<p></p>
In most healthy individuals with no
evidence of concurrent infection or inflam&shy;mation, the
concen&shy;tration of serum or plasma ferritin parallels the
total amount of storage iron


<span data-tippy-content="Cook, J. D., Lipschitz, D. A., Miles, L. E., and Finch, C. A. (1974). Serum ferritin as a measure of iron stores in normal subjects. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 27(7), 681&#8209;687.">

 Once
iron stores become exhausted, how&shy;ever, serum ferritin
concen&shy;trations no longer reflect the severity of the
iron-defi&shy;ciency state. Serum ferritin is the only measure of iron
status that can reflect a deficient, excess, or normal iron
status. Evidence for the quantitative relationship between
serum ferritin and storage iron is shown in
<a href="#box17.4">Box&nbsp;17.4</a>.
<a id="box17.4"></a>
<div class="box">
<b>Box&nbsp;17.4: Evidence for the quantitative relationship
between serum ferritin and storage iron</b>
<ul class="no-padding" style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>
Stainable bone marrow stores corre&shy;late positively
with serum ferritin levels.
<li>
Iron removal by phlebotomy produces a fall in serum
ferritin levels, the decline paralleling changes in liver
iron stores as measured by liver biopsy.
<li>
Iron therapy and repeated blood transfusions
generate a positive response in serum ferritin levels.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
Translation of serum ferritin values into the size of the iron
stores should be made cautiously, in view of the limited
knowledge of this relationship and the confounding factors
that influence serum ferritin concen&shy;trations. There is also
considerable between-subject variation in the relationship between serum ferritin
and tissue iron. In otherwise healthy individuals, a serum
ferritin concen&shy;tration of 1&micro;g/L is said to be equivalent to
approx&shy;imately <span class="n">8&#8209;10mg</span> of storage iron in an adult

During iron overload, how&shy;ever, the proportion of
iron stored as insoluble hemo&shy;siderin increases.
Besides providing a body store of iron, the uptake of iron
into ferritin limits the capacity of iron to generate free radicals and
prevents oxidative damage to tissues

healthy subjects over a period of weeks is about 15%

<b>Age-related changes</b> in serum ferritin
concen&shy;trations are relatively marked and differ according
to sex. At birth, concen&shy;trations are high, as iron stores in
the liver are abundant. During the first 2mo, serum ferritin
levels rise further, as iron is released from the fetal red
cells and the rate of erythro&shy;poiesis is slow. Serum ferritin
concen&shy;trations then fall throughout later infancy

As a result, there may be a need to develop
sex-specific cutoffs for serum ferritin in infancy. During
adolescence, females have lower values than males, a
trend that persists into late adulthood, reflecting their
lower iron stores due to menstruation and childbirth.
Levels in males reach a maximum between 30 and 39y,
after which levels remain constant until about 70y. In
females, serum ferritin levels remain relatively low until
menopause, after which they rise steeply

<b>Iron defi&shy;ciency</b> leads to lower iron stores: serum
ferritin values fall progressively as the stores decline, and
before the characteristic changes in serum iron and TIBC.
The decline in serum ferritin arises because hepcidin levels
are suppressed in iron defi&shy;ciency, thus facilitating the
greater mobilization of iron from body stores. How&shy;ever,
once body iron stores are depleted (i.e., serum ferritin
concentrations &lt;&nbsp;15&micro;g/L), serum ferritin concentrations are not
indicative of the severity of iron defi&shy;ciency

<b>Acute and chronic inflam&shy;mation</b>
increase levels of pro-inflam&shy;matory cytokines
in the systemic circu&shy;lation, which in turn elevate
serum ferritin, an acute phase protein.
At the same time, hepatic synthesis of hepcidin,
also an acute phase protein, is increased, thereby
inhibiting both the release of iron from body stores
and the absorp&shy;tion of dietary iron from the gastrointestinal tract.
Reductions in food intake, and hence iron intake
during inflam&shy;mation, may also impair iron status.

of serum C&#8209;reactive protein (CRP) and &alpha;&#8209;1&#8209;acid-glycoprotein
(AGP), each providing a measure of the severity
and duration of acute and chronic inflam&shy;mation, respectively.
The assay of CRP and AGP clearly
aids the inter&shy;pretation of serum ferritin

inflam&shy;mation are widespread; see <a href="#17.7.3">Section&nbsp;17.7.3</a>

<b>Preg&shy;nancy</b> results in a gradual decrease
in serum ferritin concen&shy;trations, reaching the
lowest concen&shy;tration in the third trimester, a
decline partly attributed to hemo&shy;dilution together with
progressive depletion of iron stores in
unsup&shy;ple&shy;mented women. At this stage, if iron
stores are exhausted, serum ferritin will no
longer reflect the severity of the iron deficient state.
In women sup&shy;ple&shy;mented with iron, how&shy;ever, the
decline in serum ferritin in the third trimester
is reduced

In addition, because preg&shy;nancy is an inflam&shy;matory state,
the potential effect of inflam&shy;mation on serum ferritin
concen&shy;trations must be taken into account in
their inter&shy;pretation. As a conse&shy;quence,
including concurrent measure&shy;ment of inflam&shy;matory
markers such as CRP and AGP with serum ferritin during preg&shy;nancy is essential.
<p></p>
In view of these uncertainties, the use of low serum ferritin
concen&shy;trations alone to define iron defi&shy;ciency
during preg&shy;nancy is not recom&shy;mended.

Over time, the excess iron accumulates in these conditions,
mainly as ferritin with a small amount as
insoluble hemosiderin, most notably in the liver,
eventually resulting in hepatic or cardiac
complications unless treated. How&shy;ever,
in view of the high variability in the mean
serum ferritin concen&shy;trations noted in the
cases with and without iron overload
in <a href="#table17.19">Table&nbsp;17.19</a>,
serum ferritin should not be used alone to detect
iron overload. Instead, serum ferritin should be used
alongside other iron bio&shy;markers (e.g., trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration)
and known genetic and clinical risk factors

<b>Obesity</b> may be associated with normal to

result of adiposity-related chronic inflam&shy;mation.
The cytokines, notably inter-leukin&#8209;6 (IL&#8209;6)
and leptin, released from the enlarged adipocites,
stimulate an increase in circu&shy;lating hepcidin levels
that block the release of iron from body stores into the

and down regulate intestinal iron absorp&shy;tion

Clearly, the increased levels of serum ferritin
in the obese children could have con&shy;tributed
to an under&shy;estimation of iron defi&shy;ciency
among this cohort, if the additional iron
bio&shy;markers had not been measured.
<p></p>
<b>Decreased erythro&shy;poiesis</b> is associated
with a decreased utilization of iron for
Hb synthesis, so serum ferritin levels
may be normal or slightly above normal.
Decreased erythro&shy;poiesis may be associated
with disease conditions such as chronic renal
diseases and aplastic anemia.
<p></p>
<b>Increased erythro&shy;poiesis</b> leads to a decline
in storage iron, reflected by a fall in serum ferritin levels
owing to the increased demand for iron for Hb synthesis.
Conditions in which increased erythro&shy;poiesis occurs
include the stages of the life cycle when iron
needs are increased, such as during growth and preg&shy;nancy,
after recovery from bone-marrow depression, hypoxia, and in response
to vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> and folate therapy.
<p></p>
<b>Genetic Hb disorders</b> such as thalassemia traits
and Hb EE may elevate serum ferritin (and sTfR)
concen&shy;trations because of ineffective erythro&shy;poiesis
and the short life span of red blood cells.
As a conse&shy;quence of these distur&shy;bances,
levels of hepcidin are inappro&shy;priately low resulting
in an excessive absorp&shy;tion of iron that leads
to iron overload, and thus elevated serum ferritin
levels

Clearly, the assessment of the preva&shy;lence
of iron defi&shy;ciency based on a low serum ferritin
concen&shy;tration is challenging in settings where
infection or inflam&shy;mation are widespread.
Many approaches have been proposed for adjusting for the effect of inflam&shy;mation on
ferritin and other iron bio&shy;markers

<span data-tippy-content="Thurnham D. I. (2014). Interactions between nutrition and immune function: using inflam&shy;mation bio&shy;markers to interpret micro&shy;nutrient status. The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 73(1), 1&#8209;8.">

Recently, a new regression modeling approach
has been developed by the BRINDA group
(Bio&shy;markers Reflecting Inflam&shy;mation and
Nutritional Determinants of Anemia).
In this approach, the inflam&shy;matory bio&shy;markers
(CRP and AGP) are treated as continuous
variables because no clear cutoff was found
for CRP or AGP at which there was a change
in the relationship between inflam&shy;mation and ferritin.
By using this new approach, the full range
and severity of inflam&shy;mation can be accounted for,
with greater corrections applied when the
inflam&shy;matory bio&shy;markers indicate severe
inflam&shy;mation; for more details see Raiten et&nbsp;al.

WHO (2020) have also compiled cutoff values
to define risk of iron overload in non-healthy individuals.
For school-age children (5&#8209;12y),
adolescents (13&#8209;19y), and adults of all ages, the suggested serum ferritin
cutoff is &gt;&nbsp;500&micro;g/L. How&shy;ever, WHO caution that a serum ferritin
concentration &gt;&nbsp;500&micro;g/L may indicate risk of iron overload or other
diseases, and highlight the need for further clinical and laboratory evaluation
to establish the diagnosis and underlying causes of the elevated ferritin levels.
<p></p>
<b>Cutoffs for serum ferritin indicative of
iron defi&shy;ciency for individuals with infection or inflammation</b>
have been compiled by WHO

<span data-tippy-content="WHO Guidelines: Use of ferritin

For infants 0&#8209;23mos, preschool children (24&#8209;59mos),
the WHO cutoff recom&shy;mended is a serum ferritin &lt;&nbsp;30&micro;g/L.
For school-age children (5&#8209;12y), adolescents (13&#8209;19y),
adults (20&#8209;59y), and older persons (&ge;&nbsp;60y), a
serum ferritin &lt;&nbsp;70&micro;g/L is recom&shy;mended.
How&shy;ever, many factors influence the effect of
inflammation on serum ferritin, including the
degree and duration of inflammation and immunity, so
it is not unexpected that iron defi&shy;ciency
may exist in cases of inflammation even when
serum ferritin concentrations are below these cutoffs

As an example, in the national survey in the Cameroon,
applying a serum ferritin cutoff of &lt;&nbsp;30&micro;g/L
under&shy;estimated the prevalence of iron defi&shy;ciency
when compared to that based on inflammation-adjusted
body iron stores &lt;&nbsp;0mg/kg

<h3 id="17.7.4">17.7.4 Measure&shy;ment of serum ferritin</h3>

Venipuncture or capillary blood samples, fasted or nonfasted, can be used for
serum or plasma ferritin, although within- and
between-sample variation tends to be larger
with capillary than venous specimens. Blood must be refrigerated immediately
after collection, and processed within a
few days. For ferritin assays, serum is stable
for &gt;&nbsp;1wk at 4&deg;C, and
for &gt;&nbsp;1y at &lt;&nbsp;&minus;20&deg;C, and
can be subjected to 3&nbsp;freeze-thawing cycles
without any negative affect on the concen&shy;trations.
For optimal long-term storage, serum must
be stored at &lt;&nbsp;&minus;40&deg;C, and when stored at
&minus;70&deg;C, serum ferritin is stable
for &gt;&nbsp;10y

Before analysis, the DSS must be digested
for 6h with cellulase from <i>Trichoderma reesei.</i>
<p></p>
In the past, serum ferritin was often determined
with a single-incubation 2&#8209;site
immuno&shy;radio&shy;metric assay (IRMA), a procedure
used in the earlier U.S.&nbsp;NHANES and
the U.K.&nbsp;Diet and Nutrition Surveys.
In later U.S.&nbsp;NHANES <span class="n">(2004&#8209;2006),</span>
the Roche Tina-quant ferritin
immuno&shy;turbi&shy;metric assay has been
used on a clinical analyzer. This method,
although automated, requires a large
sample (&gt;&nbsp;150&micro;L) which is a
disadvantage for capillary or pediatric specimens.
Today, commercial kits based on enzyme-linked immuno assays (ELISA)
are also available which compare relatively
well across manufacturers, with CVs ranging from 10&mdash;15%

A ferritin certified reference material is
available from WHO through the U.K. National Institute for Biological
Standards and Controls (NIBSC, RM 94/572).
This was used in NHANES&nbsp;III, and the use
of this reference material as a calibration check is strongly encouraged.

<h2 id="17.8">17.8 Erythrocyte protoporphyrin</h2>

When the supply of iron is adequate, heme is synthesized by
the incorporation of iron into proto&shy;porphyrin&nbsp;IX
by the enzyme ferro&shy;chetalase. How&shy;ever, when there
is insufficient iron to allow this reaction,
zinc is substituted for iron, forming zinc&nbsp;proto&shy;porphyrin (ZPP).
The ZPP then accumulates within the
iron-deprived circu&shy;lating erythrocytes, and can be measured
directly in samples of whole blood using a portable
hemato&shy;fluoro&shy;meter. An alternative
chemical method can also be used whereby the
porphyrins are extracted in a solvent, after which the porphyrins are measured
fluoro&shy;metrically. With this method, ZPP is converted to free erythrocyte
proto&shy;porphyrin (FEP)

<span data-tippy-content="WHO. (2007). Annex 3. Assessing the iron status of popu&shy;lations : including literature reviews : report of a
Joint World Health Organization/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Technical
Consultation on the Assessment of Iron Status at the popu&shy;lation Level, Geneva, Switzerland,

(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241596107"
target="right" >WHO, 2007</a>).</span>

This extraction method now yields
measure&shy;ments almost identical to
the direct measure&shy;ments of ZPP performed using a portable
hemato&shy;fluoro&shy;meter, provided the instrument used is properly
calibrated and maintained, and a standardized procedure followed.
<p></p>
The zinc-for-iron substitution occurs
predominantly within the bone marrow
so a rise in the concen&shy;tration of ZPP is
one of the first indicators of insufficient
iron in the bone marrow. Zinc protoporphyrin persists
in the iron-deprived circu&shy;lating erythrocytes
for the duration of their lifespan (i.e., &asymp;&nbsp;120d).
There&shy;fore, an increased ZPP concen&shy;tration
in the blood indicates that the majority of the
erythrocytes matured at a time when the
iron supply was suboptimal (i.e., during the
preceding <span class="n">3&#8209;4mos),</span> and thus provides
a measure of uncom&shy;plicated iron-defi&shy;ciency.
The more pronounced the iron defi&shy;ciency,
the higher the ZPP values, with the highest
values seen in severe iron defi&shy;ciency anemia.
<p></p>
As ZPP and FEP are now interchangeable, the term erythrocyte
protoporphyrin (EP) is now recom&shy;mended, irrespective
of the measurement method used, and is the term applied herein.
A normal healthy person will
have an EP concen&shy;tration of less
than <span class="n">40&#8209;50&micro;g&nbsp;EP/dL</span> of red
blood cells (RBCs), but when iron
stores are exhausted (i.e., iron deficient erythro&shy;poiesis),
the concen&shy;tration may increase to more
than <span class="n">70&#8209;100&micro;g/dL&nbsp;RBCs,</span>
reaching as high as 200&micro;g/dL in iron
defi&shy;ciency anemia

<p></p>
When a hematofluorometer is used to measure
EP, Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations are also measured,
allowing the EP to be expressed directly as a ratio of EP/Hb.
Use of the ratio minimizes the effect of
dilution that results from the expansion in
plasma volume that occurs in preg&shy;nancy: EP, RBCs, Hb, and heme are
diluted equally. In this way, a misinter&shy;pretation
of laboratory results is avoided
that may arise, for example, from plasma-volume changes in preg&shy;nancy.
How&shy;ever, EP is expressed in several other ways in the literature,
and may include EP relative to either
whole blood (i.e., &micro;g&nbsp;EP&nbsp;/&nbsp;
dL whole blood) or RBCs (i.e., &micro;g EP&nbsp;/&nbsp;dL&nbsp;RBCs).
When the hematocrit is known, then the
conversion of &micro;g&nbsp;EP&nbsp;per&nbsp;dL
whole blood to &micro;g&nbsp;per&nbsp;dL RBCs is as follows:

\[\small \mbox {&micro;g EP per dL red blood cells} = \frac{\mbox {&micro;g EP per dL whole blood}}{\mbox{Hematocrit (%)}} \]

From &micro;g&nbsp;EP&nbsp;per&nbsp;dL RBCs to &micro;g&nbsp;EP&nbsp;per&nbsp;g Hb:
multiply by 0.037.
From &micro;g&nbsp;EP&nbsp;per&nbsp;dL RBCs
to &micro;mol&nbsp;EP&nbsp;per&nbsp;mol heme: multiply by 0.87.

These factors are based on the assumption that the MCHC is normal, although when MCHC
is measured in individual samples, then an appro&shy;priate factor can be calculated.

<b>Iron deficient erythro&shy;poiesis,</b>
charac&shy;ter&shy;ized by the exhaustion of iron stores,
leads to a slow but progressive increase in
EP in the peripheral blood which is apparent
before any decline in Hb and MCV.
The increase in EP concen&shy;tration occurs slowly
because only the newly produced erythrocytes
con&shy;taining ZPP appear in the
peripheral blood to replace those erythrocytes
at the end of their life span
(i.e., &asymp;&nbsp;120 days)

<p></p>
<b>Infection / Inflam&shy;mation</b> is associated with
elevated levels of EP. This is due to the
increase in pro-inflam&shy;matory cytokines in the
systemic circu&shy;lation which stimulate an
increase in hepcidin concen&shy;trations.
Elevated level of circu&shy;lating hepcidin
reduce both iron absorp&shy;tion and the
release of iron from body stores so that
iron is no longer available for trans&shy;port
to the bone marrow for erythro&shy;poiesis.
When the iron is no longer available,
divalent zinc is inserted into protoporphyrin,
so concen&shy;trations of EP are elevated,
irrespective of the EP assay method used.
As a result, during inflam&shy;mation, assay
of EP alone cannot be used to distin&shy;guish
between the anemia of iron defi&shy;ciency
and the anemia of chronic disease.
<p></p>
<b>Preg&shy;nancy</b> is believed not to result
in a decline in EP when expressed
as a molar ratio to Hb, as the ratio is
theoretically independent of hemo&shy;dilution.
Conse&shy;quently, EP expressed as a molar ratio to Hb
has been proposed as a preferred marker
of iron status in preg&shy;nancy

How&shy;ever, in pregnant women in Kenya without
evidence of inflam&shy;mation or infection
with <i>Plasmodium</i> or HIV, EP reportedly had a
limited ability to discriminate between women
with and without iron defi&shy;ciency even
when combined with Hb, and irrespective of
whether EP was measured in washed
erythrocytes or whole blood using a
hemato&shy;fluor&shy;ometer or by solvent
extraction. Moreover, the preva&shy;lence of iron defi&shy;ciency
was grossly over-estimated when applying the
conventional EP cutoff for whole
blood (&gt;&nbsp;70&micro;mol/mol Hb) in
comparison with that based on plasma
ferritin concen&shy;trations &lt;&nbsp;15&micro;g/L,
especially when the preva&shy;lence of iron defi&shy;ciency
was low (e.g., 10%)

Based on these results, the usefulness of EP:Hb
molar ratio to assess iron status during preg&shy;nancy, particularly in disadvantaged settings, remains uncertain.

<b>Lead toxicity</b> can result in elevated concen&shy;trations of EP due to
distur&shy;bances in the heme synthesis pathway;
lead inhibits porphobilinogen synthase which
results in an increased excretion of
amino&shy;lae&shy;vulinic acid (ALA) in the urine. Lead may also
have a direct effect on the enzyme ferrochetalase

Several issues may affect the direct measure&shy;ment
of EP using a hemato&shy;fluor&shy;ometer.
These include the requirement to oxygenate
the blood sample if the time between the blood
sampling and EP measure&shy;ment is &gt;&nbsp;30min,
and the need to wash the red blood cells with saline.
Incomplete oxygenation produces falsely low values
because of a shift in Hb absorp&shy;tion.
To ensure complete oxygenation and
dissolution of red-cell aggregates, the
whole blood must be stirred gently using a
disposable plastic pipet tip. Wooden applicator
sticks should not be used for mixing as
they may con&shy;tain fluorescent by-products.
Successive observations should be within 10%.
Use of red blood cells that are washed with saline
rather than whole blood are recom&shy;mended to
remove interference by non-porphyrin
fluorescent compounds such as bilirubin,
certain drugs, and high ribo&shy;flavin concen&shy;trations
that may be present in the plasma

<h2 id="17.9">17.9 Serum soluble trans&shy;ferrin receptor</h2>

Trans&shy;ferrin receptor (TfR) is an iron-related
protein that regulates the uptake of trans&shy;ferrin,
carrying iron into body cells. The surfaces of all
cells express TfR in proportion to their
requirement for iron, although the largest number
are in the erythron, placenta, and liver

A soluble form of sTfR circulates in human plasma
bound to trans&shy;ferrin and is usually called
soluble trans&shy;ferrin receptor (sTfR).
The predominant source of sTfR in the plasma pool
are the cells of the developing red-cell mass &mdash;
the erythroblasts and reticulocytes.
Hence, the concen&shy;tration of sTfR
reflects erythropoietic activity in the bone marrow

In the first stage of the devel&shy;opment of uncom&shy;plicated
iron defi&shy;ciency anemia, termed &ldquo;iron
depletion&rdquo;
(<a href="#17.1.9">Section&nbsp;17.1.9</a>), the supply of
iron to the functional compartment is not compro&shy;mised,
so concen&shy;trations of sTfR in serum or plasma are
unaffected. How&shy;ever, in the second stage,
termed &ldquo;iron-deficient erythro&shy;poiesis&rdquo;
when body iron stores are exhausted and the
availability of iron to tissues is
compro&shy;mised, trans&shy;ferrin produc&shy;tion is
upregulated to increase iron trans&shy;port,
and cell surface TfR1 expres&shy;sion increases.
This allows the cells to compete more effectively
for trans&shy;ferrin-bound iron, and results in an increase
in sTfR concen&shy;trations in plasma or serum.
In contrast, when there is sufficient body iron,
TfR1 is down regulated so concen&shy;trations
of sTfR in the plasma or serum fall. As a result,
sTfR levels in plasma or serum reflect the functional iron deficit

One of the main advantages of using serum sTfR is
that concen&shy;trations are less strongly affected
by inflam&shy;mation than
serum ferritin. Nevertheless, because any change in the rate of erythro&shy;poiesis
will in turn affect serum sTfR concen&shy;trations, sTfR can only be used as an indicator of iron
status when iron stores are exhausted and there are no other causes of
abnormal erythro&shy;poiesis

Changes in these iron biomarkers were marked.
Note that the Hb declined from 14wk through
30wk gestation, hepcidin declined from enrolment through 20wk gestation,
whereas the changes for serum ferritin, serum transferrin receptor,
and thus total body iron were only significant here between 20wk
and 30wk gestation.
Extensive investigations of associations between the variables revealed that
hepcidin was superior to sTfR (and Hb) as an indicator of iron deficiency; see

<b>Malaria</b> has the potential for
influencing serum sTfR concen&shy;trations
in two opposing ways. A decrease in
serum sTfR concen&shy;trations may result
from a reduction in erythro&shy;poiesis
associated with the marked inflam&shy;matory
response during the acute phase of malarial infections.
Erythro&shy;poiesis may also be suppressed in part by a
direct inhibitory effect of hemozoin, a parasite
by-product of Hb

Alternatively, serum sTfR concen&shy;trations can be elevated in malaria after the
initial acute infection. This trend is thought to be due to an increase in erythropoietic
activity to compensate for the increased red-cell destruction. Hence,
in areas where both iron defi&shy;ciency and malaria occur, the reliability of serum
TfR as an indicator of iron status is uncertain. Rohner et&nbsp;al.

Clearly, it is difficult to use serum sTfR to detect
tissue iron defi&shy;ciency in popu&shy;lations
where the preva&shy;lence of these disorders is high.
<p></p>
<b>Increased or ineffective erythro&shy;poiesis</b> in
disease conditions itemized in
<a href="#table17.28">Table&nbsp;17.28</a>,
are associated with elevated serum sTfR
concen&shy;trations, as reported earlier.
Note that both folic acid and
vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> defi&shy;ciency are included
because they are both associated with defective
but elevated erythro&shy;poiesis. In such cases,
use of serum sTfR measure&shy;ments alone would
yield a false-positive diagnosis for iron defi&shy;ciency.
<p></p>

Fortunately, these conditions can usually be
identified by measuring serum ferritin,
which is normal in hematologic disorders with
decreased erythro&shy;poiesis
(<a href="#17.7.1">Section&nbsp;17.7.1</a>).

<b>High altitudes</b> may result in higher
serum sTfR concen&shy;trations, as a conse&shy;quence
of the increase in the total body erythroid mass in
response to systemic hypoxia.
Hypoxia increases the expres&shy;sion of erythro&shy;poietin,
and the erythro&shy;poietin drives the
produc&shy;tion of new erythro&shy;cytes

<b>Obesity</b> has been linked to elevated serum sTfR concen&shy;trations.
This trend has been related to elevated levels of hepcidin in response
to obesity-related inflam&shy;mation and an
increase in Hb mass (i.e., total Hb&nbsp;in&nbsp;g)

Defining reference values for sTfR in healthy
individuals is difficult because serum sTfR
concen&shy;trations and the units of expres&shy;sion
vary with the assay; even dif&shy;fer&shy;ent kits
based on the ELISA technique are

require a relatively large sample volume

and utilize reagents that are relatively costly,
with poor comparability across assays. In low income countries, manual

The use of several concurrent bio&shy;markers of iron status
provides a more valid assessment of iron
status than measure&shy;ment of any single bio&shy;marker. Such an
approach minimizes the misclassification that can occur
due to the overlapping of normal and abnormal values when a

Moreover, use of multiple bio&shy;markers enables the three stages in the devel&shy;opment
of iron-defi&shy;ciency anemia (iron depletion, iron-deficient
erythro&shy;poiesis, and iron-defi&shy;ciency anemia) to be
charac&shy;ter&shy;ized. In this way, the severity of iron defi&shy;ciency
can be dif&shy;fer&shy;entiated more readily. In addition, normal
iron status and iron overload can also be identified. The
relationship between the bio&shy;markers commonly used
(serum ferritin, trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration, erythro&shy;cyte
proto&shy;porphyrin, serum sTfR, Hb) and the gold standard

was based on serum ferritin, trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration, and

Increasingly, the inclusion of serum sTfR as one of the
laboratory criteria to assess iron status is recom&shy;mended
because it is a relatively sensitive and reliable guide to the
degree of functional iron defi&shy;ciency (i.e., iron-deficient
erythro&shy;poiesis)

The NHANES&nbsp;III <span class="n">2003&#8209;2006</span> survey
was the first U.S.&nbsp;NHANES survey to include a
combination of bio&shy;markers that included serum sTfR,
serum ferritin, and Hb to describe the iron status
of a popu&shy;lation. The rationale for this combination was that
while serum ferritin levels reflect the decline of body iron
stores, it does not reflect the severity of the depletion
once the iron stores are exhausted. In contrast, serum sTfR
concen&shy;trations increase after iron stores are exhausted,
when they continue to rise with increasing functional iron
defi&shy;ciency (i.e., in iron-deficient erythro&shy;poiesis).
Further&shy;more, such a combination provides diagnostic
information over a wide spectrum of iron status, ranging
from replete iron stores to overt iron defi&shy;ciency anemia.
Cutoff values for serum sTfR are not included
in Table 17.34 because assay-dependent cutoffs must be applied.

for preva&shy;lence estimates, a single number based on the
preva&shy;lence from serum ferritin should be used except in
settings where inflam&shy;mation is prevalent when the
preva&shy;lence based on sTfR is more appro&shy;priate. Where
possible, when determining preva&shy;lence estimates,

of the most appro&shy;priate iron bio&shy;markers to evaluate the
impact of inter&shy;ventions to control iron defi&shy;ciency, and to
predict a change in Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;trations in
response to iron inter&shy;ventions in popu&shy;lations (e.g.,
sup&shy;ple&shy;mentation or fortif&shy;ication). Based on data from nine
double-blind, randomized controlled trials in which iron
was provided as sup&shy;ple&shy;ments or as food fortified with iron
for periods of <span class="n">4&#8209;18mos,</span> serum ferritin and
Hb were concluded as the most efficient
indicators of popu&shy;lation response to iron inter&shy;ventions.
Serum ferritin or serum sTfR, although less
successful, were considered the best to predict a change in
Hb&nbsp;concen&shy;tration in response to iron
inter&shy;ventions. Further&shy;more, WHO advised that if both
serum ferritin and serum sTfR were measured, then body
iron stores could be estimated to predict the change in
Hb, provided the correct algorithm was applied;

It is noteworthy, that in settings where iron defi&shy;ciency is
the major cause of anemia, then the Hb
concen&shy;tration is likely to improve more rapidly than serum
ferritin following an iron inter&shy;vention. How&shy;ever, when
other factors in addition to iron are the cause of anemia, then an
improvement in serum ferritin rather than Hb is
more likely. Again, bio&shy;markers of inflam&shy;mation (CRP and
AGP) should also be assayed, where possible, so that
serum ferritin and serum sTfR concen&shy;trations can be
adjusted for inflam&shy;mation, where necessary.

<h3 id="17.10.1">17.10.1 Use of ratios of sTfR to serum ferritin
as indicators of iron status</h3>

Increasingly, the ratio of sTfR to serum ferritin is being
used as an indicator of the extent of iron defi&shy;ciency. Serum
ferritin, as noted in <a href="#17.7">Section&nbsp;17.7</a>,
is a sensitive indicator until body iron stores (mainly in hepato&shy;cytes) are
depleted, but once stores are totally exhausted (i.e., with
serum ferritin &lt;&nbsp;12g/L), serum ferritin does not provide
information on the severity of the iron defi&shy;ciency. In
contrast, serum sTfR is a sensitive indicator after body
iron stores are exhausted, with concen&shy;trations
progressively increasing as iron defi&shy;ciency advances.
Hence, in combination, these two bio&shy;markers assess the
full range of iron status from severe defi&shy;ciency to
overload. Moreover, when expressed as a ratio, they
correct for any plasma volume expansion differences
during preg&shy;nancy, thus providing a more accurate
reflection of iron status at this time. Never&shy;the&shy;less, the
practical utility of the sTfR/ ferritin ratios in serum for
detecting iron defi&shy;ciency in the presence of inflam&shy;mation
is still uncertain

 and is easier to calculate than body
iron. Their results confirmed that because of the reciprocal
relationship between serum sTfR and ferritin
measure&shy;ments, the ratio of sTfr:SF represented iron status
over the entire range in their study. When plotted
logarithmically, the ratio increased from &lt;&nbsp;100 in
those with ample iron stores to &gt;&nbsp;2,000 in those with
signif&shy;icant functional iron defi&shy;ciency. A rise above 500
occurred when stores were fully depleted (i.e., iron stores
of 0mg/kg). A major disadvantage of this simple ratio is
that its inter&shy;pretation is assay dependent. The cutoff
developed for the simple ratio (i.e., &le;&nbsp;500 indicative of
ample iron stores; &gt;&nbsp;500 of depleted iron stores) was
established with the Ramco assay, and should only been
used with data generated with either the Ramco assay

relationship between the logarithm of the ratio of
sTfR/serum ferritin and total body iron stores expressed as
mg per kg body weight.

The formula for this relationship (based on both sTfR and
serum ferritin (SF) expressed as &micro;g/L) is the following:

<p></p>
Never&shy;the&shy;less, several uncertainties remain when using
TBI to define iron defi&shy;ciency. As an example, whether
the equation for estimating total body iron is appro&shy;priate
for young children and pregnant women is unclear. The
equation was validated only in non-pregnant adults

 and the relationship between TBI
and serum ferritin and sTfR concen&shy;trations may differ in
these life-stage groups. Further&shy;more, the changes in
serum ferritin and sTfR that occur during more gradual
reduction in body iron stores may not resemble those
observed during the relatively rapid reduction in body iron

There is also some confusion over the term TBI
because it is not a measure of the quantity of iron in the
body of an individual. Instead, total-body iron provides a
quantitative estimate of the size of the body store when
iron is present in the store (i.e., values &gt;&nbsp;0mg/kg). In the
case of iron defi&shy;ciency (i.e., values &lt;&nbsp;0mg/kg) ,
TBI provides an estimate of the quantity of iron that
would be needed to replace the functional deficit

In light of the confusion, an alternative
term &mdash; body iron index &mdash; has been proposed.
<p></p>
In addition, there is some concern over the assumption that a body
iron index value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; is in fact the criterion for defining iron
defi&shy;ciency in view of inconsistencies in the reported
preva&shy;lence of iron defi&shy;ciency estimated by serum / plasma
ferritin, sTfR, and TBI

This has prompted the suggestion

iron defi&shy;ciency; for more discussion of these concerns, see

In the future, the devel&shy;opment of low cost ELISA assays
capable of measuring several iron and inflam&shy;mation
status bio&shy;markers simul&shy;tane&shy;ously from a small volume of
serum / plasma will assist in improving the reliability of the
diagnosis of iron defi&shy;ciency. This is especially needed in settings where a
high burden of infectious diseases, genetic Hb disorders,
and micro&shy;nutrient deficiencies have often confounded the
inter&shy;pretation of the data.

<h2 id="17.11">17.11 Emerging iron status indicators</h2>

Emerging indicators, currently mainly used in a
research setting, include hepcidin, non-trans&shy;ferrin-bound
iron, and some reticulocyte indices. More work is
required to understand the diagnostic value of these
emerging indicators before they become more widely
available for public health or clinical use.

<h3 id="17.11.1">17.11.1 Hepcidin</h3>

Hepcidin is a protein encoded by the HAMP gene.
It plays a major role in controlling physio&shy;logical
iron homeo&shy;stasis, as noted earlier. Hepcidin binds and subsequently causes
degradation of the iron-exporter ferroportin, thereby
inhibiting both absorp&shy;tion of dietary iron from the
gastro&shy;intestinal tract and the release of iron from body
stores (<a href="#17.1.2">Section&nbsp;17.1.2</a>).
In con&shy;ditions of iron depletion or
increased iron demand, hepatic synthesis of hepcidin is
reduced, thus facilitating iron absorp&shy;tion and mobil&shy;ization
from body stores via active ferro&shy;portin. In contrast when
iron stores are replete (or in renal impairment when
excretion of hepcidin is suppressed), hepcidin levels are
increased which block the release of iron into the circu&shy;lation.
Instead, iron is lost with the cell when it is shed from the
villus. Hepcidin produc&shy;tion by the liver is also regulated by
inflam&shy;mation and erythro&shy;poietic activity.
<p></p>
Hepcidin may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of
iron-refractory anemia (i.e. the type of iron defi&shy;ciency anemia that
typically does not improve with oral iron treatment), in
dif&shy;fer&shy;entiating between iron defi&shy;ciency anemia and anemia
of chronic disease and in patients with iron overload
syndromes. As hepcidin is a determinant of dietary iron
absorp&shy;tion, hepcidin may also provide guidance on safe
iron sup&shy;ple&shy;mentation in countries with a high infection
burden

<b>Inflam&shy;mation</b> raises levels of pro-inflam&shy;matory
cytokines in the systemic circu&shy;lation, which in turn increase
serum hepcidin levels, an acute-phase protein, just like
serum ferritin. Elevated hepcidin levels reduce both iron
intestinal absorp&shy;tion and the release of iron from body
stores, thus decreasing the amount of circu&shy;lating serum iron
and thereby limiting erythro&shy;poiesis. Hence, the risk of iron
defi&shy;ciency increases, even though body iron stores are
normal.

The results shown in <a href="#figure17.18">Figure&nbsp;17.18</a>
are based on a group of Indonesian
children <span class="n">(5&#8209;15y)</span> (n&equals;1197)
screened by microscopy for the presence of parasitemia, Hb, serum hepcidin,
indices of iron status (ferritin, sTfR, mean cell volume) and
inflam&shy;mation (CRP) at baseline and 4&nbsp;weeks after antimalarial treatment.
<p></p>
It is of interest that the presence of even mildly elevated hepcidin
concen&shy;trations appear to induce functional iron defi&shy;ciency
in these Indonesian children with asymptomatic parasitemia,
as indicated by lower values of Hb, MCV, serum
iron and trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration. These findings suggest that
in the presence of asymptomatic malaria, iron therapy for the treatment of
malaria anemia may be less effective because absorp&shy;tion of iron is
compro&shy;mised by the high hepcidin concen&shy;trations.
Moreover, the iron therapy may be even hazardous, increasing malaria-associated morbidity
and mortality

This suggests that maternal iron defi&shy;ciency is not
solely responsible for the sharp decline. Even mothers with replete iron stores
have low hepcidin concen&shy;trations at delivery, suggesting
that maternal hepcidin may be actively suppressed during
preg&shy;nancy

How&shy;ever, in pregnancies complicated by infection or
inflammation (including obesity), maternal hepcidin concentrations
are elevated compared to healthy controls. Hence, in these
conditions maternal and fetal iron bioavailability could be
compromised in pregnancy, limiting the amount of iron
presented for uptake by the placenta and
for transfer to the fetus

Measure&shy;ment of hepcidin in urine may provide a
less-invasive screening for iron status and warrants
more investigation. Concen&shy;trations are elevated in
anemic children with febrile malaria.

<h3 id="17.11.2">17.11.2 Novel red blood cell indices</h3>

Novel red blood cell indices are generated by
specific models of hematology automated cell
counters and include among others, reticulocyte
mean Hb content (RHcc) and mean
reticulo&shy;cyte volume (MRV). How&shy;ever, their
inter&shy;pretation is complicated by the dif&shy;fer&shy;ent
techniques used by the manufacturer and the lack
of system&shy;atic studies to determine their
usefulness to evaluate nutritional anemias.
<p></p>
<b>Reticulocyte Hb content (RHcc)</b>
reflects directly the synthesis of Hb in
bone marrow precursors and is a measure of the
adequacy of the availability of iron. It can be used
to dif&shy;fer&shy;entiate iron defi&shy;ciency from other causes
of anemia. Reticulo&shy;cyte Hb content is sometimes used in clinical
settings to establish iron status in young children
with anemia, when other common iron bio&shy;marker
assays may not be available; low values provide an
early marker of iron deficient erythro&shy;poiesis. The
measure&shy;ment of RHcc is not useful in individuals
with &alpha; and &beta;&#8209;thalassemias (including individuals
who are hetero&shy;zygous) when the reticulocyte
Hb count is reduced independently of
iron stores.
<p></p>
Reticulocyte Hb content can also be used
to measure the early response to intravenous iron
therapy because it increases signif&shy;icantly after
only <span class="n">48&#8209;72h</span>

<span data-tippy-content="Buttarello M. (2016). Laboratory diagnosis of anemia: are the old and new red-cell parameters useful in classification and treatment, how?. International journal of laboratory hematology, 38 Suppl 1, 123&#8209;132.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27195903/"
target="right" >Buttarello, 2016</a>)</span>.

The sensitivity and specificity of RHcc for diagnosing iron
defi&shy;ciency is only moderate, with no
recom&shy;mended cutoffs to define iron defi&shy;ciency.
How&shy;ever, RHcc is less
affected by inflam&shy;mation than serum iron,
trans&shy;ferrin satu&shy;ration, and ferritin, although it is
influenced by any con&shy;ditions that cause iron
restricted erythro&shy;poiesis


<span data-tippy-content="Gelaw, Y., Woldu, B., and Melku, M. (2019).

target="right" >Gelaw et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>)</span>.


<p></p>
<b>Reticulocyte volume</b> is also an index that
can be measured by some newer hematology
analyzers. Values for reticulocyte volume decrease
rapidly with the devel&shy;opment of iron-deficient
erythro&shy;poiesis and increase rapidly in individuals
with depleted iron stores or nutritional
macrocytosis after therapy with iron, or
vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> and/or folic acid, respectively. How&shy;ever,
numeric results depend on the analyzer
manufacturer, making comparisons difficult

<h3 id="17.11.3">17.11.3 Non-trans&shy;ferrin bound iron</h3>

Iron in plasma is tightly bound to trans&shy;ferrin, the
iron trans&shy;port protein that delivers iron
throughout the body, as noted earlier
(<a href="#17.6">Section&nbsp;17.6</a>).
Cells take up trans&shy;ferrin-bound iron in
proportion to the number of cell-surface
trans&shy;ferrin receptors (TfR1). When cellular iron levels are
sufficient, the uptake of trans&shy;ferrin decreases to
limit further iron assimilation and prevent
excessive iron accumulation; usually only <span class="n">20&#8209;30%</span>
of trans&shy;ferrin is saturated with iron. How&shy;ever, in
iron overload con&shy;ditions, such as hereditary
hemo&shy;chromatosis and thalassemia major,
trans&shy;ferrin is fully saturated
and non-trans&shy;ferrin-bound iron (NTBI) appears in serum. Note the
high concen&shy;trations of NTBI in the patients with
HbE &beta;&#8209;thalassemia in
<a href="#table17.40">Table&nbsp;17.40
</a>,
which were
inversely associated with hepcidin. This trend may
reflect the increased release of iron into the
plasma that occurs when suppressed hepcidin
levels permit enhanced iron absorp&shy;tion and
mobilization. The NTBI also corre&shy;lated with ferritin
and liver iron concen&shy;trations, suggesting that a
high level of NTBI is associated with hepatic iron
accumulation

<span data-tippy-content="Jones, E., Pasricha, S. R., Allen, A., Evans, P., Fisher, C. A., Wray, K., Premawardhena, A., Bandara, D., Perera, A., Webster, C., Sturges, P., Olivieri, N.

target="right" >Jones et&nbsp;al., 2015</a>)</span>.

<p></p>
There is no known regulatory mech&shy;anism for NTBI
uptake so NTBI can enter cells readily, where it
produces free radicles resulting in cellular and
organ damage. Circulating NTBI may also cause an
increase in bacterial-pathogenic infections owing
to the free ion being utilized by the parasite.
Concern has been raised over the rapid
absorp&shy;tion of iron sup&shy;ple&shy;ments given in
non-physio&shy;logical amounts, and their potential for
exceeding the capacity for trans&shy;ferrin to bind the
circu&shy;lating iron, resulting in the formation of NTBI
concen&shy;trations

<p></p>
The measure&shy;ment of serum NTBI is fraught with
problems, often with a 40-fold variation
difference in methods, in part due to the
hetero&shy;geneous nature of the chemical forms of
NTBI, as well as large analytical variation. A new
automated NTBI assay has been developed which
looks promising in terms of reproducibility and
comparability with HPLC, one of the most reliable
methods to quantify NTBI. Never&shy;the&shy;less, more
research is required to define the most relevant
forms of NTBI, and understand their clinical
importance
