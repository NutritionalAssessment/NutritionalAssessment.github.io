Magnesium is a cofactor for over 600&nbsp;enzymatic reactions vital for life and is a controlling factor
in nerve transmission, skeletal and smooth muscle contraction, cardiac excitability, vasomotor
tone, blood pressure, and bone turnover.  Thus, magne&shy;sium deficiency can have detrimental
consequences that include impaired physical and mental well-being and risk for chronic
disease.  Before&nbsp;1990, a nutritional magne&shy;sium deficiency was considered rare and to be
present mainly in clinical conditions associated with gastrointestinal or renal loss of magne&shy;sium.
However, numerous reports of an association between a low magne&shy;sium intake and chronic
diseases, especially those associated with chronic inflam&shy;matory stress, has led to the
recognition that mild or subclinical magne&shy;sium deficiency, also known as chronic latent
magne&shy;sium (CLMD) deficiency, may be quite prevalent.   As a result, magne&shy;sium has become a
nutrient of public health concern and a simple, rapid, and reliable clinical measure is needed to
assess for magne&shy;sium deficiency.  Numerous methods of magne&shy;sium status assessment have
been developed, but all have shortcomings that impact their use in the clinical setting to
accurately assess magne&shy;sium status.
<p></p>
The predominant method for assessing magne&shy;sium status at present is the determination of
total serum or plasma magne&shy;sium.   However, this method is not a sensitive indicator of body
stores of magne&shy;sium.  In the reference range of serum or plasma magne&shy;sium values, there is an
interval in which individuals may have either CLMD or an adequate status.  Combining
measurement of total serum or plasma magne&shy;sium with both the determination of magne&shy;sium
from dietary intake and urinary excre&shy;tion appears to enhance the usefulness of this method to
assess magne&shy;sium status.
<p></p>
Recent models of ion-selective electrodes have enabled the measurement of plasma ionized
magne&shy;sium, the physiologically active form, to be acceptably accurate and precise
using whole blood.  As a result, this method is becoming more prevalent in the clinical setting
because the procedure is simpler and requires less blood than the measurement of total
magne&shy;sium in plasma or serum magne&shy;sium.  However, plasma ionized magne&shy;sium has
shortcomings similar to those for total plasma and serum magne&shy;sium regarding the sensitivity
of the reference range to deter&shy;mine CLMD accurately.
<p></p>
Measurements of magne&shy;sium in erythro&shy;cytes, erythro&shy;cyte membranes, and mono&shy;nuclear cells
give a reasonable assessment of physiologically active body stores of magne&shy;sium.  However, all
these methods are laborious and prone to error, and hence only suitable for use in a research
setting and not for routine clinical use.
<p></p>
Urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion is an excellent indicator of magne&shy;sium intake. However, a single
urinary magne&shy;sium determination may not reflect magne&shy;sium stores because it responds so
rapidly to changes in dietary intake. Hence, it is mainly appropriate for use in population
studies, or in combination with other measures of status.
<p></p>
The magne&shy;sium load test provides the most valid assessment of magne&shy;sium status.  It has been
used to identify magne&shy;sium deficiency in elderly individuals, in chronic alcoholism, and in
several chronic diseases in which hypomagnesemia was not present.  The test deter&shy;mines the
per&shy;cent&shy;age of urinary magne&shy;sium retained over a given period of time after parenteral
admin&shy;istration of a magne&shy;sium load and yields an abbreviated balance determination. The test
is invasive, time-consuming, and cumbersome; it requires close supervision for at least 24&nbsp;hours
after a magne&shy;sium load.  Because of these drawbacks, it has been used mostly as a research
tool.
<p></p>
Several other methods used to assess magne&shy;sium status also have drawbacks that preclude
their use as routine clinical methods.  Muscle magne&shy;sium determination is extremely invasive
and requires skill to obtain suitable samples for analysis.  Buccal cell magne&shy;sium determinations
also require skill in obtaining cells, and special expensive equipment for analysis.  Magnesium
balance requires controlled and consistent dietary intakes and careful collection of urine and
stool over a lengthy study period.  Fractional excre&shy;tion of magne&shy;sium requires the
determination of three variables and has no apparent advantage over other well-estab&shy;lished
methods.  The magne&shy;sium depletion score needs further evaluation and validation, although
seems to be most useful for establishing status in individuals with a chronic disease.  However,
all these methods do not have an estab&shy;lished validated reference range that indicates
magne&shy;sium adequacy or deficiency.
<p></p>
At present, there is no simple, rapid, and reliable single clinical method to deter&shy;mine the
presence of chronic, latent magne&shy;sium deficiency (CLMD).  Determination of serum total or
ionized magne&shy;sium remains the most acceptable choice in the clinical setting.  The reliability of
these measures of status could be improved if their values for the reference ranges indicative of
deficient or adequate magne&shy;sium status are confirmed by other measures such as the
determination of magne&shy;sium in both dietary intakes and urinary excre&shy;tion.

<h2 id="23c.1">23c.1 Introduction</h2>

The human body contains about 760mg of magne&shy;sium at&nbsp;birth, 5g at age
<span class="n">4&#8209;5</span>&nbsp;months, and 25g
when adult

There are three body pools of magne&shy;sium

<span data-tippy-content="Rude RK and Shils ME, 2006. Magnesium. In: Shils ME, Shike M, Ross AC, Caballero B, and
Cousins RJ (eds). Modern Nutrition in health and disease, 10th ed. Baltimore, MD: Lippincott

(<a href=""
target="right" >Rude & Shils, 2006</a>). </span>

One pool has a turnover rate of less than 28hours.   This pool of extracellular magne&shy;sium, which includes
blood, contains <span class="n">0.8&#8209;1.0%</span> of body magne&shy;sium.
The second pool has a turn&shy;over rate of about 11days.  This pool is primarily intra&shy;cellular
magne&shy;sium, of which about 40% of the magne&shy;sium is found in soft tissues where it performs
most of its essential functions.  Skeletal magne&shy;sium is the third pool with a slow turnover rate
meas&shy;ured in months or years in normal adults.  Skeletal magne&shy;sium contains about 60% of body
magne&shy;sium of which two-thirds is found within the hydration shell (bone mineral or poorly
crystal&shy;lized hydroxy&shy;apatite) and one-third on the crystal surface of the skeleton

<span data-tippy-content="Rude RK and Shils ME, 2006. Magnesium. In: Shils ME, Shike M, Ross AC, Caballero B, and

Surface magne&shy;sium is readily exchangeable with serum and serves as a reservoir for the
maintenance of magne&shy;sium for essential functions when intakes of magne&shy;sium are deficient.

<h2 id="23c.2">23c.2 Functions of magne&shy;sium</h2>

Divalent magne&shy;sium (Mg2<sup>+</sup>) is the fourth most abundant cation in the body and is second to
potassium as the most abundant intra&shy;cellular cation.  Magnesium is a cofactor for over
600&nbsp;enzymatic reactions vital to pathways including DNA, RNA, protein and adenosine
5'-tri&shy;phos&shy;phate (ATP) synthesis; cellular energy production
and storage; glycol&shy;ysis; and cellular
second messenger systems.   The predominant enzymatic role of magne&shy;sium in these pathways
involves an enzyme inter&shy;acting with MgATP to complete a reaction.  Magnesium also binds
directly to enzymes to cause conform&shy;ational change (allosteric activation) that gives a catalysis
center for reaction to occur.  Stabil&shy;ization of ribo&shy;nucleo&shy;tides
and deoxy&shy;ribo&shy;nucleo&shy;tides by
magne&shy;sium allow for DNA duplication, trans&shy;cription, and maintenance, and transfer RNA
function

<span data-tippy-content="Rude RK and Shils ME, 2006. Magnesium. In: Shils ME, Shike M, Ross AC, Caballero B, and

(<a href=""

Magnesium reacts with phosphates and carboxy&shy;lates to
stabilize membranes, affecting their fluidity and permeability which influences cellular ion
channels, trans&shy;porters, and signaling

<span data-tippy-content="Rude RK and Shils ME, 2006. Magnesium. In: Shils ME, Shike M, Ross AC, Caballero B, and

 Through regulating
Ca2<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>
movement in and out of the cell, magne&shy;sium is a controlling factor in nerve transmission,
skeletal and smooth muscle contraction, cardiac excitability, vasomotor tone, blood pressure,
and bone turnover.

<h2 id="23c.3">23c.3 Absorption and metabolism</h2>

The jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of magne&shy;sium absorption; lesser amounts are
absorbed by the cecum and colon.  When dietary intakes of magne&shy;sium are near require&shy;ment,
<span class="n">45&#8209;55%</span>
is absorbed.  With intakes less than 50% of require&shy;ment, the per&shy;cent&shy;age of magne&shy;sium
absorbed may increase to
<span class="n">65&#8209;70%.</span>
As dietary intake increases over require&shy;ment the per&shy;cent&shy;age
of magne&shy;sium absorbed decreases.  For example, with an intake of 972mg, fractional
absorption of magne&shy;sium was only 11%

<span data-tippy-content="Fine, K. D., Santa Ana, C. A., Porter, J. L., & Fordtran, J. S. (1991).

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1864954/"
target="right" >Fine et al., 1991</a>). </span>

<p></p>
Magnesium is absorbed via both active trans&shy;port (trans&shy;cellular) and passive diffusion
(para&shy;cellular).  Active trans&shy;port occurs in the ileum, although apparently also in the cecum and
colon through the action of magne&shy;sium trans&shy;porters: transient receptor potential melastatin
(TRPM) type&nbsp;6 (TRPM6) and TRPM7

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25540137/"
target="right" >de Baaij et al., 2015</a>).</span>

Passive paracellular diffusion
accounts for about 90% magne&shy;sium absorption and is dependent on a high concen&shy;tration in the
jejunum and ileum and a transcellular potential difference generated by sodium trans&shy;port

<p></p>
Magnesium absorption can also be affected by other dietary components, including calcium,
phosphorus, fiber, phytate, protein, and oxalates, all of which can decrease absorption, whereas
vitamin&nbsp;D and its active metabolites, carbo&shy;hydrates fer&shy;ment&shy;able by bacteria, and
oligo&shy;saccharides increase absorption

<p></p>
The primary organ regulating magne&shy;sium homeostasis is the kidney where about 10% of total
body magne&shy;sium is filtered daily through the glomeruli with the nephron recovering
<span class="n">95&#8209;99%</span>&nbsp;of filtered magne&shy;sium.
Passive diffusion associated with calcium, sodium, and water trans&shy;port
results in the reabsorption of about
<span class="n">10&#8209;25%</span>&nbsp;of the magne&shy;sium

<span data-tippy-content="de Baaij, J. H., Hoenderop, J. G., & Bindels, R. J. (2015). Magnesium in man: implications for health and disease. Physiological reviews, 95(1), 1–46.">

target="right" >de Baaij et al., 2015</a>). </span>

Passive diffusion in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle accounts for about 50-70% of the
magne&shy;sium reabsorption.  The remaining
<span class="n">5&#8209;10%</span>&nbsp;of
filtered magne&shy;sium is reabsorbed in the
distal convoluted tubule via an active transcellular mechanism.  The active trans&shy;port channel in
the kidney apparently involves TRPM6.   When magne&shy;sium intakes are deficient, excre&shy;tion of
magne&shy;sium by the kidney decreases to
<span class="n">12&#8209;24mg/day</span>
to conserve body magne&shy;sium.  Diets high
in sodium, calcium and protein, and caffeine and alcohol consumption all enhance magne&shy;sium
excre&shy;tion

<h2 id="23c.4">23c.4 Magnesium deficiency in humans</h2>

Signs and symptoms of severe magne&shy;sium deficiency include positive Trousseau's and
Chvostek's signs; muscle spasms, fasciculations, and tremor; and personality changes such as
apathy, depression, nervous&shy;ness, delirium, and hallucinations

<span data-tippy-content="Rude R. K. (1998). Magnesium deficiency: a cause of heterogeneous disease in humans. Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, 13(4), 749–758.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9556074/"
target="right" >Rude, 1998</a>). </span>

However, severe
magne&shy;sium deficiency involving these signs and symptoms is rare and usually associated with
predisposing and complicating disease states that cause low magne&shy;sium intakes or impaired
intestinal or renal absorption.
<p></p>
In conditions of long term moderate or mildly deficient intakes of magne&shy;sium or excessive
excre&shy;tion, magne&shy;sium is slowly released from bone to assure that vital essential functions are
fulfilled. Nevertheless, there may still be a lack of magne&shy;sium required for some functions, but
the signs associated with severe magne&shy;sium deficiency outlined above do not occur.  This lack
has been called chronic latent magne&shy;sium deficiency (CLMD)

<p></p>
Chronic latent magne&shy;sium deficiency is considered a factor contributing to several chronic
diseases, especially cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease, sudden cardiac
death, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic stroke

The associated risk of CLMD with cardiovascular disease is through impaired glucose metabolism
and insulin action, dyslipidemia, hyper&shy;tension, chronic inflammation, and impaired vasomotor
tone

<p></p>
Chronic latent magne&shy;sium deficiency also may result in an increased risk for bone fractures and
osteo&shy;porosis

<span data-tippy-content="Costello RB, Rosanoff A.  (2020).  Magnesium.

Apatite crystals formed in magne&shy;sium-deficient
bone are increased in size, which makes bone more brittle, increasing the fracture risk.  Magnesium
deficiency can also reduce parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels, which
affect the regulation of magne&shy;sium-dependent calcium channels and changes in the release of
inflam&shy;matory cytokines. Such effects enhance osteo&shy;clastic action
and inhibit osteo&shy;blastic action,
resulting in bone loss and an increased risk for osteo&shy;porosis.
<p></p>
Other chronic diseases with which CLMD has been associated include osteo&shy;arthritis,
chondro&shy;calcinosis, depression, and migraine headaches

In addition, CLMD has been found to cause chronic inflam&shy;matory & oxidative stress, indicating
that through these effects, CLMD may contribute to chronic diseases, other than those noted
above, in which inflam&shy;matory or oxidative stress facil&shy;itates their occurrence.

<h2 id="23c.5">23c.5 Food sources and dietary Intakes</h2>

Foods of plant origin provide about 50% of the magne&shy;sium intake for adults on mixed diets

Rich food sources of magne&shy;sium include whole grains / cereal, nuts, pulses, green leafy vege&shy;tables, and
dark chocolate.  Inter&shy;mediate sources of magne&shy;sium include cheese, meats, and most sea&shy;foods.
Refined grains are poor sources of magne&shy;sium.

<h2 id="23c.6">23c.6 Effects of high magne&shy;sium intakes </h2>

Because the kidneys are very effective in the excre&shy;tion of excessive magne&shy;sium, severe
magne&shy;sium toxicity rarely occurs.  When severe toxicity resulting in high blood magne&shy;sium
occurs, the condition arises almost exclusively in individuals with kidney dysfunction or failure
who are given magne&shy;sium salts or drugs such as laxatives or antacids.  Symptoms of toxicity
include lethargy, confusion, nausea, diarrhea, impaired breathing, hypotension, muscle
weakness, and heart arrhyth&shy;mias

Signs of hyper&shy;magnesemia also include low
blood calcium and high blood potassium.  The heart rhythm changes in magne&shy;sium toxicity are
caused by abnormal electrical conduction which occurs at the nervous, muscular, and cardiac
level.
<p></p>
Severe magne&shy;sium toxicity caused by excessive intake through food has not been reported.
High intakes of supplemental magne&shy;sium available in forms such as aspartate, citrate, chloride,
gluconate, lactate, and oxide can cause adverse effects such as diarrhea, abdominal cramping,
and nausea.  A tolerable upper intake level (UL), defined as the highest level of daily intake that
is likely to pose no risks of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general
population, was set at 350mg of supplemental magne&shy;sium in the United States and Canada for
children older than 8&nbsp;years and adults by the

Recently, it has been suggested that the DRIs for magne&shy;sium estab&shy;lished for the United States
and Canada should be revised and lowered to reflect findings of the improved balance study
data

<span data-tippy-content="Nielsen F. H. (2016). Guidance for the determination of status indicators and dietary requirements for magnesium. Magnesium research, 29(4), 154–160.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28132953/"
target="right" >Nielsen, 2016</a>). </span>

These balance study data indicated that the EAR and the Recommended
Dietary Allowance (RDA, defined as average daily intake sufficient to meet the daily
require&shy;ments for almost all (about 97%) of healthy individuals) for 70kg healthy adults should
be 175 and 250mg/d for 70kg healthy male and female individuals, and increase or decrease based
on body weight, independent of age.   The balance data found neutral
balance (i.e., when intake and loss of magne&shy;sium from the body were equal) at 2.36mg/kg/day,
the value indicating the amount of decrease or increase in the DRIs with each change in kg of
body weight.  Even with the lower DRIs, many individuals weigh more than 70kg and/or have
health problems which will result in an increase in the need for magne&shy;sium. As a consequence,
it is likely that over 25% of the United States population have an intake of magne&shy;sium less than
the EAR.   Thus, because mild or moderate magne&shy;sium deficiency can increase the risk for
numerous chronic disorders, it is apparent that magne&shy;sium is a nutrient of concern requiring a
clinically useful and sound indicator of magne&shy;sium status.

<h2 id="23c.8">23c.8 Indices of magne&shy;sium status </h2>

Because magne&shy;sium has so many critical functions, the body has strong mechan&shy;isms, such as
reducing urinary excre&shy;tion and releasing skeletal stores of magne&shy;sium, to assure that
magne&shy;sium is readily available to fulfill those functions.  In addition, mild or moderate
magne&shy;sium deficiency is mostly asymptomatic.  As a result of these character&shy;istics, success in
finding a cost-effective, time-efficient, and reliable indicator of magne&shy;sium status is lacking.
Among the status indicators that have been evaluated are serum or plasma total magne&shy;sium,
serum ionized magne&shy;sium, erythro&shy;cyte magne&shy;sium, erythro&shy;cyte membrane magne&shy;sium, blood
mono&shy;nuclear cell magne&shy;sium, urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion, magne&shy;sium load test, sublingual
magne&shy;sium, muscle magne&shy;sium, and fractional excre&shy;tion of magne&shy;sium.  An additional factor
that may be useful in evaluating exposure to magne&shy;sium is dietary intake.

<h3 id="23c.8.1">23c.8.1 Serum/plasma magne&shy;sium </h3>

At present, total serum magne&shy;sium is the predominant clinical test to assess magne&shy;sium status,
although plasma total magne&shy;sium is sometimes meas&shy;ured instead of serum magne&shy;sium.
However, serum is preferred because anti-coagulants might be contam&shy;inated with magne&shy;sium
or affect assessment methods.  Serum magne&shy;sium determination is inexpensive and easily
performed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry or colorimetric
methods.  The normal range for serum magne&shy;sium is
<span class="n">0.75&#8209;0.95mmol/L.</span>
<a href="#figure23c.1">(Figure&nbsp;23c.1)</a>.
Hence, theoretically, serum concen&shy;trations above 0.75mmol/L should be considered magne&shy;sium
sufficient, and those below 0.75mmol/L should be considered magne&shy;sium deficient, although,
as indicated below, perhaps not rightly so

Serum magne&shy;sium
concen&shy;trations are reportedly acceptable for determining a severe lack of magne&shy;sium intake or
an elevated urinary excre&shy;tion of magne&shy;sium
resulting in a depletion of body stores.  This finding is based on the
results of a study in which exposure to extreme dietary magne&shy;sium deprivation
(less than 12mg/day) resulted in a decline in serum magne&shy;sium from 0.80mmol/L to 0.61mmol/L in three
weeks

However, in mild or moderate dietary magne&shy;sium deprivation,
serum magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations can remain in the normal range after several weeks, based on
controlled metabolic unit studies of postmenopausal women whose dietary intakes were
changed from adequacy (250mg/day) to moderate deficiency

Nevertheless, the magne&shy;sium-deprived women showed signs indicative of
magne&shy;sium deficiency that responded to magne&shy;sium supplementation, indicating their body
tissues were becoming magne&shy;sium deficient.   Results of these metabolic unit studies are
consistent with clinical studies of patients with diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and malabsorption
syndromes, all of whom had serum magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations in the sufficient range, yet had
low magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations in erythro&shy;cytes, mono&shy;nuclear cells, and muscle

<h3 id="23c.8.2">23c.8.2 Serum, plasma, and blood ionized magne&shy;sium</h3>

Ionized magne&shy;sium is the physio&shy;logically active form of magne&shy;sium that is trans&shy;ported across
cell membranes and participates in meta&shy;bolic inter&shy;actions and enzymatic reactions.  Thus, it has
received attention as a better measure than serum total magne&shy;sium for indic&shy;ating the status of
magne&shy;sium for essential cellular functions in the body.   Ionized magne&shy;sium is deter&shy;mined in
serum, plasma, or whole blood samples by using equipment with ion-selective electrodes.  The
first ion-selective electrodes were challenging to use, cost-intensive, and had poor
ability to discrim&shy;inate ionized magne&shy;sium from ionized calcium; this inhibited the use of ionized
magne&shy;sium as a status-assessment measure.  However, recent models of ion-selective
electrodes are cost-effective and have been shown to be acceptably accurate and precise in
measuring only ionized magne&shy;sium.
<p></p>
Originally, serum ionized magne&shy;sium was often deter&shy;mined, but at present, it is plasma
magne&shy;sium that is mostly meas&shy;ured in whole blood; the ionized magne&shy;sium in erythro&shy;cytes is
not meas&shy;ured.   An advantage of using whole blood is that less blood and fewer procedures are
needed for analyses.   High&nbsp;pH and high concen&shy;trations of ionized calcium, lipo&shy;philic cations,
and thiocyanate (caused by smoking tobacco) can interfere with the deter&shy;mination of plasma
ionized magne&shy;sium by ion-selective electrodes

<p></p>
Plasma ionized magne&shy;sium as a status assess&shy;ment measure has the same problems as those
outlined for plasma total magne&shy;sium; the body also attempts to maintain magne&shy;sium
concen&shy;trations in plasma at a level needed for vital functions through reduced urinary excre&shy;tion
and bone resorption.  Factors that affect plasma total magne&shy;sium, such as diuretics, proton
pump inhibitors, and various disease states, also affect plasma ionized magne&shy;sium.    An
additional issue is that a refer&shy;ence range for plasma ionized magne&shy;sium indicative of adequate
magne&shy;sium status has not been firmly estab&shy;lished and appears to vary depending upon the
instrument used for determining a range.  A systematic review and meta-analysis involving all
types of instruments used found a 95% confidence interval for ionized magne&shy;sium in healthy
adults to be 0.40 to 0.68mmol/L

<span data-tippy-content="Ansu Baidoo, V. Y., Cara, K. C., Dickinson, S. L., Brown, A. W., Wallace, T. C., Chung, M., & Gletsu-Miller, N. (2023).

Using this as a reference range
indicates plasma ionized magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations below 0.40mmol/L are most likely
indicative of magne&shy;sium deficiency and those above 0.68mmol/L are hyper&shy;magnesemic.
However, the meta-analysis also found that in patients with chronic diseases such as
cardio&shy;vascular disease, type&nbsp;2 diabetes, and hyper&shy;tension associated with magne&shy;sium
deficiency, the 95% confidence intervals for plasma ionized magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations included
those found for healthy individuals.  This indicates, as noted for plasma total magne&shy;sium, that
individuals in the desig&shy;nated adequate range for plasma ionized magne&shy;sium may also be
magne&shy;sium deficient.   Thus, additional measures of a dietary magne&shy;sium intake &lt;250mg/day
and a urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion &lt;80mg/day might help in identifying individuals who are very
magne&shy;sium deficient even though they have plasma ionized magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations in the
low healthy reference range.

<h3 id="23c.8.3">23c.8.3 Erythrocyte magne&shy;sium</h3>

Magnesium exists in erythro&shy;cytes in free, complex, and protein-bound forms.  Magnesium
concen&shy;trations in erythro&shy;cytes are about three times greater than those in plasma and reflect
chronic rather than acute magne&shy;sium status because of the long lifespan of erythro&shy;cytes
(120&nbsp;days).   Cellular magne&shy;sium is considered more reflective
of magne&shy;sium status than circulating
magne&shy;sium.  However, erythro&shy;cyte magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations have been reported as not
correlating well with other tissue pools such as mono&shy;nuclear blood cells or muscle

Thus, it is uncertain how well erythro&shy;cyte magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations reflect
body magne&shy;sium stores.
<p></p>
Determination of cellular magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations takes special procedures including
centri&shy;fug&shy;ation to separate blood into an erythro&shy;cyte bottom layer,
an inter&shy;mediate  buffy-coat
layer of white blood cells, and a top layer of plasma.  Erythro&shy;cytes are then acid digested and
the magne&shy;sium content deter&shy;mined by atomic absorption spectrometry.   Care must be taken to
avoid hemol&shy;yzing the blood sample when obtaining the erythro&shy;cytes as it would result in loss of
magne&shy;sium to the plasma portion.  A reference range for the concen&shy;tration of magne&shy;sium in
erythro&shy;cytes of 1.65 to 2.65mmol/L has been reported

also deter&shy;mined erythro&shy;cyte ionized magne&shy;sium by
hemol&shy;yzing the erythro&shy;cytes to release ionized magne&shy;sium for measurement by an ion selective
electrode.  However, determining the erythro&shy;cyte ionized magne&shy;sium content  or expressing
magne&shy;sium per cell or g&nbsp;hemo&shy;globin did not appear to be any better for assessing cellular
magne&shy;sium status than determining erythro&shy;cyte magne&shy;sium mmol/L packed cells.   Further
studies might find measuring red blood cell membrane magne&shy;sium useful in the research setting.
<p></p>
Even though the assessment of body magnesium stores or CLMD may be slightly
better using  erythrocyte magnesium, the method of measurement is
laborious and prone to error, that
coupled with lack of a well validated reference range, preclude measurements of
erythro&shy;cyte magne&shy;sium from being a useful clinical method for determining magne&shy;sium status.
Erythrocyte membrane or packed cell magne&shy;sium determin&shy;ation may be useful in determining
changes in magne&shy;sium status in long-term research studies of magne&shy;sium depletion and
repletion.

Although cellular mono&shy;nuclear magne&shy;sium appears to be a better indicator of magne&shy;sium
status or stores than serum total or ionized magne&shy;sium, several drawbacks preclude the use of
cellular mono&shy;nuclear magne&shy;sium as a routine clinical measure. For example, large blood
samples are required for fractionating cellular components. Moreover, the fractionation method
used to obtain the specific cell types is difficult, time consuming, and prone to errors. Analysis
of magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations in the specific cell types is usually performed by atomic
absorption spectrometry.

<h3 id="23c.8.5">23c.8.5 Urinary magne&shy;sium</h3>

Urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion is an excellent indicator of magne&shy;sium intake and is usually
meas&shy;ured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion data obtained from
27&nbsp;metabolic unit studies have shown that when intakes were 200mg/day or lower, urinary
magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion generally ranged from
<span class="n">40&#8209;80mg/day</span>
<span class="n">(1.65&#8209;3.29mmol/day).</span>
When dietary intakes were greater than 250mg/day, urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion ranged from

<span class="n">100&#8209;140mg/day</span>
<span class="n">(4.11&#8209;5.76mmol/day)</span>
The four depletion-repletion experiments also found that urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion
responded quickly to changes in dietary magne&shy;sium. For example, in one study, women who
consumed a mean magne&shy;sium intake of 390mg/day had a mean daily urinary excre&shy;tion of
<span class="n">120&#8209;130mg/day)</span>
<span class="n">(4.93&#8209;5.35mmol/day).</span>
When the women were switched to a diet supplying a
mean magne&shy;sium intake of 120mg/day, mean urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion decreased to
63mg (2.59mmol) per day within 6&nbsp;days. A switch from a magne&shy;sium deficient intake to an
adequate intake resulted in a similar change in urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion within 6 days.
These findings indicate that a single 24&#8209;hour urine sample or short-term determination of
24&#8209;hour urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion alone is not useful as an indicator of current magne&shy;sium
status at the individual level because urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion could be low while an
individual still has an adequate magne&shy;sium status and vice versa. However, at the population
level, urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion could be an indicator of the amount of inadequate
magne&shy;sium status in a population.  This suggestion is supported by the findings that low urinary
magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion has been associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease

Urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion can also be useful in magne&shy;sium status assessment when
combined with other measures of magne&shy;sium status. As indicated above, using a urinary
magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion of &lt;&nbsp;80mg/day combined with a dietary magne&shy;sium intake &lt;&nbsp;250mg/day
could increase the likelihood of identifying individuals who are magne&shy;sium-deficient even
though serum magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations are within the low healthy reference range. This
suggestion is supported by a recent finding that young women with a mean urinary magne&shy;sium
excre&shy;tion of 58.2mg/day, a dietary magne&shy;sium intake of 145mg/day, and a normal serum

<h3 id="23c.8.6">23c.8.6 Magnesium load test</h3>

The magne&shy;sium load test is considered by many to be the best method for determining total
body magne&shy;sium status or general intra&shy;cellular magne&shy;sium content.  The basis for the
magne&shy;sium load test is that the kidney regulates the body stores of magne&shy;sium by excreting
excess magne&shy;sium when stores are adequate and retaining magne&shy;sium when stores are
deficient.  This test deter&shy;mines the per&shy;cent&shy;age of magne&shy;sium retained over a given period time
after parenteral admin&shy;istration of a magne&shy;sium load

Retention of a greater per&shy;cent&shy;age of magne&shy;sium than that retained by individuals with
adequate magne&shy;sium status indicates some depletion of body magne&shy;sium.   The test depends
upon normal renal function; it cannot be used on individuals with renal diseases or who are
taking drugs that affect renal function.  The magne&shy;sium load test has been used to identify
magne&shy;sium deficiency in elderly individuals, and in conditions of chronic alcoholism, ischemic
heart disease, hyper&shy;tension, and Crohn's disease

where hypomagnesemia was not always found.
<p></p>
To perform this test properly, a basal urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion is deter&shy;mined.  Three
con&shy;sec&shy;utive 24&#8209;hour urine samples should be collected to yield the most accurate basal
magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion and counteract the effects of both diurnal and random
<span class="n">day-to-day</span>
variations in magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion.  Never&shy;the&shy;less, measurement of a single 24&#8209;hour basal
urinary magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion collected just before the magne&shy;sium load is most often used
because it has been found to give acceptable results.  After the determination of the basal
urinary excre&shy;tion, magne&shy;sium is admin&shy;istered parentally instead of orally to eliminate variability
that would occur with intestinal absorption.  A slow infusion, usually done over a period of 4&nbsp;to
8&nbsp;hours, is needed because plasma magne&shy;sium concen&shy;tration deter&shy;mines the renal
reabsorption threshold.  A sudden increase in plasma magne&shy;sium above the normal level would
increase urinary excre&shy;tion and thus reduce magne&shy;sium retention, which could result in an
erroneous assessment of status.  Following the load, urinary excre&shy;tion of magne&shy;sium is
meas&shy;ured over the subsequent 24&nbsp;to 48&#8209;hour period.  Although a 48&#8209;hour urine collection gives
a slightly more accurate measure of magne&shy;sium retention, 24&#8209;hour urine collections have been
found to correlate well with 48&#8209;hour urine collections

Urine specimens should be collected with an acidifying agent to prevent precipitation of

basal magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion with net magne&shy;sium excre&shy;tion after the load.

The borderline deficiency values, which would indicate CLMD, are apparently
appropriate because individuals with values within this range reportedly had chronic diseases
associated with a low magne&shy;sium status but did not exhibit hypomagnesemia (i.e., low serum
magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations).
<p></p>
The magne&shy;sium load test is invasive, time-consuming, and cumbersome; it requires close
supervision for at least 24&nbsp;hours after magne&shy;sium infusion to ensure oversight of both the total
amount of magne&shy;sium infused and the urine collection.  These drawbacks prevent the
magne&shy;sium load test being a routine clinical measure of magne&shy;sium status.  It has been used
most often as a research tool to deter&shy;mine whether individuals with chronic disease are

nitric acid.  Magnesium was deter&shy;mined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry.
Muscle magne&shy;sium concen&shy;trations were 53.4, 48.1, and 51.6mmol/kg dry weight during the

measurement is very expensive and requires the use of complex instruments and sophisticated
software, which precludes its use in specialized laboratories only.
Because other methods, such as the magne&shy;sium load test, and erythro&shy;cyte membrane and
mono&shy;nuclear cell magne&shy;sium determinations give status information of similar validity,
using muscle magne&shy;sium to assess status in either the clinical or research setting is not useful.

The cells are collected by gentle scratching of sublingual
tissue and then fixed on a carbon slide with a cytology fixative.  The magne&shy;sium in the fixed cells
is deter&shy;mined by using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis.    However, the test of magne&shy;sium in
sublingual epithelial cells as a measure of magne&shy;sium status needs to be validated by using
another test such as the magne&shy;sium-load test.  Furthermore, the method is expensive and
requires skill in collecting suitable sublingual epithelial cell samples for analysis, which has
limited its use mainly to research laboratories.

<p></p><b>Magnesium balance</b> (intake minus loss) is the principal measure used to deter&shy;mine dietary
magne&shy;sium require&shy;ments.  Most balance studies have been performed in clinical research
centers.  The method requires an accurate determination of magne&shy;sium from dietary intake and
from the complete collection of urine and stool over at least 12&nbsp;days.  It also should include the
collection and measurement of sweat, dermal, and menstrual losses of magne&shy;sium, although
generally these losses have not been meas&shy;ured in reported balance studies.  A negative balance
(i.e., magne&shy;sium losses exceed magne&shy;sium intake) indicates a magne&shy;sium deficiency, and a
positive balance (i.e., magne&shy;sium intake exceeds magne&shy;sium losses) indicates adequacy.
 Most reported balance studies prior to 1990 did not have well-controlled dietary intakes of
magne&shy;sium, used short periods of data collection, and/or used less accurate methods to
measure magne&shy;sium.  A poorly controlled magne&shy;sium balance study was used to set the DRIs
for magne&shy;sium in the United States and Canada

Fractional excre&shy;tion of magne&shy;sium (FEMg) greater than 2% is considered an indication of renal
wasting which implicates extra-renal magne&shy;sium losses, decreased intake, or decreased
absorption of magne&shy;sium.   As this method of assessment requires the determination of three
variables, it provides no advantage to assess magne&shy;sium status over the use of serum
magne&shy;sium, ionized magne&shy;sium, or the magne&shy;sium load test and hence has received limited
application as a measure of magne&shy;sium status.

The MDS is used to identify individuals with abnormal magne&shy;sium absorption and/or excre&shy;tion that may result in
a deficient magne&shy;sium status.  The MDS is calculated by aggregating the factors:
<ol>
<li>Current use of diuretics counted as 1 point; </li>
<li>Current use of proton pump inhibitor counted as 1&nbsp;point; </li>
<li>Heavy drinker (defined as > 1&nbsp;drink/day for women and &gt;&nbsp;2 drinks/day for men)
counted as 1&nbsp;point; </li>
<li>Mildly decreased kidney function defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
60mL/(min &times; 1.73m<sup>2</sup>) &lt;&nbsp;eGFR 90ml/min &times; 1.73m<sup>2</sup> counted as 1&nbsp;point;</li>

This suggests that sample size or disease
entity may influence the cut-point indicative of magne&shy;sium deficiency.  This new suggested
method of magne&shy;sium status assessment, especially for individuals with diseases associated
with magne&shy;sium deficiency, needs further evaluation and validation before being accepted for
general use.
