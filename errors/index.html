<p></p>
Data on food consumption are typically collected using
self-report methods.  The resulting data are affected by
measurement errors that can have serious consequences for
study findings and inter&shy;pretation.  Measurement error refers
to the difference between true and observed intake and may
be random or system&shy;atic.  Errors arise due to the
inter&shy;action of the participant with the assessment method
and can also be generateded by inter&shy;viewers and coders, as
well as by limitations in food compo&shy;sition data&shy;bases.
Accordingly, the type and extent of the errors vary with the
method used and how it is implemented, the target popu&shy;la&shy;tion
of interest, and the nutrients and foods investigated.
<p></p>
Both unaddressed random and system&shy;atic measurement error can
introduce substantial bias into results.  Pertinent to
surveillance and monitoring, measurement error can lead to
erroneous inferences about the proportions of a popu&shy;la&shy;tion
with inadequate or excessive intakes relative to nutrient
requirement estimates and food group recom&shy;mend&shy;ations.  In
epidemiologic research, measurement error distorts observed
associations between diet and disease, as well as reducing
statistical power to detect such associations.  In
inter&shy;vention research, measurement error can mask the
effects of the inter&shy;vention, particularly if the error is
differential between inter&shy;vention and control groups.
Strategies to minimize and/or mitigate error are therefore
fundamental to research making use of dietary intake data
and should be considered early in study design through to
reporting results and implications.

</div>
Sources of both random and system&shy;atic error in commonly used
methods (Chapter&nbsp;3) for measuring dietary intake are
discussed in this chapter.  Chapters 6 and 7 discuss the
related concepts of repro&shy;ducibility and validity.  Error
associated with the compilation of nutrient compo&shy;sition data
and the nutrient analysis of food items are discussed in
Chapter&nbsp;4. Error introduced by inap&shy;pro&shy;priate study design
and/or sampling of the target popu&shy;la&shy;tion are covered in
detail in survey methods and epidemi&shy;ology texts, and
considered briefly in Chapter&nbsp;1.
<p></p>
In the context of dietary
assess&shy;ment, measurement error refers to the difference
between true and observed intake and may be random or
system&shy;atic.  Data affected by random error only are not
biased but they are imprecise.  Accordingly, random
measurement error generally affects the repro&shy;ducibility
(Chapter&nbsp;6) of a given method; that is, the extent to which
the method yields similar results when used repeatedly in
the same situation.  A key source of random error is
within-person variation in intake over time.  Therefore,
random error is larger in data collected using methods that
capture intake over the short term, or quantitative daily
consumption methods (Chapter&nbsp;3), including 24h dietary
recalls and food records, compared to those like food
frequency question&shy;naires that aim to capture intake over a
longer period, such as a year

<p></p>
The random error in short-term data is largely driven by
within-person day-to-day variation in intake.  That is, what
individuals eat and drink changes from day to day, to
different extents depending on the nutrient and food group
of inter&shy;est, as well as the context and food supply.
Within-person variation in intake is not itself a form of
bias since intake truly varies from day to day.  However,
random error must be considered in data analysis and
inter&shy;pretation because it results in an observed
distribution of intake for a popu&shy;la&shy;tion based on data for a
day, or even a few days, that is too wide relative to the
distribution of usual intake

</figure>

Accordingly, when estimates
such as the proportions of a target popu&shy;la&shy;tion with intakes
above or below some threshold, such as food group
recom&shy;mend&shy;ations, are based on an observed distribution
affected by within-person variation, they will be biased.
To estimate distributions of usual intake for a popu&shy;la&shy;tion,
repeat measures on at least a subsample and statistical
modeling techniques can be used to adjust for, or remove,
the within-person variation (see Chapter&nbsp;3).  The use of
short-term data to make inferences about usual intake is
discussed in detail by Kirkpatrick et&nbsp;al.

Systematic error affects data from all self-reported dietary
assess&shy;ment methods.  However, system&shy;atic error, also known
as bias, is typically larger in data collected using methods
like food frequency question&shy;naires that aim to capture
intake over a longer period, such as a month or year

When the observed distribution of intake, including
the mean, is affected by system&shy;atic error, it is shifted
left or right compared to the true distribution of intake.
Therefore, estimates of mean intake and other parameters of
the distribution, including proportions above or below
thresholds such as food group recom&shy;mend&shy;ations, are biased.
Systematic error generally affects the validity of a method.
In epidemiologic research, measurement error distorts observed associations
between diet and disease, as well as reducing statistical power
to detect such associations

Systematic measurement error is much more difficult to
mitigate than sources of random error and unlike the latter,
cannot be addressed using repeat measures.  Rather, it is
possible to correct for system&shy;atic error using statistical
modeling only in situations in which data collected using an
unbiased reference measure, such as a recovery biomarker,
are available for at least a subsample, for example, from a
calibration substudy.  In cases in which data are available
for at least a subsample from a less biased but error prone
rather than an unbiased method, it may be possible to
somewhat mitigate the impacts of system&shy;atic measurement
error.  The implications of system&shy;atic error for the
implications of findings must be considered in all research
making use of self-report dietary intake data

target="right" >Nelson et&nbsp;al., 1994</a>). </span>

In addition to within-person variation and other random
errors, such as random misestimation of amounts consumed
caused by rounding, major sources of errors driven by the
inter&shy;action between respondents and the assess&shy;ment method
include recall, social desirability, and reactivity biases.
In studies in which dietary assess&shy;ment methods are
inter&shy;viewer-admin&shy;istered, error may be introduced if
different inter&shy;viewers probe for information to varying
degrees, intentionally omit certain questions, or record
responses incorrectly.  In studies using web-based or other
technology-enabled methods, error may come about due to a
mismatch of the inter&shy;face with the cognitive abilities, such
as literacy and numeracy abilities, of the target
popu&shy;la&shy;tion.  Another potential source of misalignment is a
lack of inclusion of foods and beverages commonly consumed
by the target popu&shy;la&shy;tion, such as in the food lists used in
web-based 24h recalls and in food frequency question&shy;naires.
Errors can also be introduced during coding, including when
foods and beverages are assigned codes, including in systems
using auto&shy;mated coding, and when portion sizes are converted
from household measures, such as measuring cups, into grams.
<p></p>
<h3>5.2.1	Recall bias</h3>
<p></p>
Complete and accurate reporting of dietary intake using both
short-term/daily consumption and long-term consumption
methods can be impacted by recall errors.  That is,
individuals may not accurately remember what was consumed,
along with the corresponding details, over either the short
term (specific memory) or the long term (generic memory)

<span data-tippy-content="National Cancer Institute. 2015.

(<a href="https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/"
target="right" >National Cancer Institute, 2015</a>). </span>

<p></p>
The 24h recall, which prompts participants to report
retro&shy;spectively what was consumed on the prior day from
midnight to midnight or during the previous 24h period
(Section&nbsp;3.1.1), relies largely on specific memory

(<a href="https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/"
target="right" >National Cancer Institute, 2015</a>). </span>

Imperfect memory, or recall bias,
may result in the omission of eating occasions, foods,
beverages, and supple&shy;ments.  Imperfect memory may also lead
the participant to report foods that were not consumed
during the recalled day (error of commission or intrusions)

Recall bias can also result in the omission of or inaccuracies in
details, such as additions to foods and beverages (e.g.,
honey in tea) and amounts consumed.  In general, food items
that contribute significantly to the main part of a meal are
better remembered than additions such as condiments and
salad dressings.  In early research assess&shy;ing adults'
ability to report amounts of foods consumed, Guthrie

<span data-tippy-content="Guthrie H. A. (1984). Selection and quantification

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6501752/"
target="right" >1984</a>) </span>

reported that for one in six respondents, salad dressings
were forgotten.  A more recent study to
assess the validity of the web-based Auto&shy;mated
Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assess&shy;ment Tool (ASA24)
similarly found that omissions
were mainly additions to or
ingredients in multicomponent foods, such as vege&shy;tables and
condiments in salads and sandwiches

In that study, fruits and vege&shy;tables were omitted
to a greater extent than sweets, snacks, and desserts,
potentially because fruits and vege&shy;tables were mainly
offered as part of other dishes.
<a href="#table5.1">Table&nbsp;5.1</a> shows the
most common items that were truly consumed
based on observation but were not reported on recalls completed using ASA24
and admin&shy;istered by inter&shy;viewers using AMPM.

Chapter&nbsp;7 further discusses the results of studies assess&shy;ing the accuracy of
24h recall data.  In food records, respondents may likewise
omit some foods and beverages consumed, including from
images taken when using mobile device-based records.
<p></p>
To facilitate more accurate recall of food consumption,
auto&shy;mated multiple-pass 24h recalls are used in many
national surveys and studies.  Multiple-pass inter&shy;viewing
techniques (Section&nbsp;3.1.1) include "probing" questions,
standardized "prompts," and/or memory aids such as food
models.  The multiple-pass approach is intended to minimize
the omission of possible forgotten foods and standardize the
level of detail for describing common foods, as well as the
methods used to elicit specific details for certain food
items.  In the EPIC study, a computer-assisted 24h diet
recall method using the software program EPIC-SOFT was
developed to standardize the cognitive memory aids used in
the first stage (called the quick list) of the multiple-pass
recall

with the similar goal of facilitating more
complete reporting and reducing omissions, for example,
through a forgotten foods list and repeated prompts to
report everything consumed on the prior day or during the

ASA24 starts by asking respondents to report eating
occasions (i.e., meals and snacks) and then prompts for the
foods and beverages consumed at each one.  Other countries
have begun to integrate web-based recall systems into their

have examined the impact of different types of prompts, including
open prompts that ask respondents to report intake freely
(used by AMPM), meal-name prompts (used by ASA24), forward
prompts (respondents are instructed to report consumption
from the beginning to the end of the reporting period; used
by NDSR), and reverse prompts (respondents are instructed to
report the most recent consumption first) on the accuracy of
reported intake among fourth-grade children.  The authors
found that the prompting method inter&shy;acted with the
retention interval; when the retention interval was short
(with the analysis focused on a recent period within the
prior 24h), there was no apparent difference in accuracy in
relation to the type of prompting.  When the retention
interval was longer (with the analysis focused on the
morning of the prior day), reverse prompting was associated
with higher accuracy

Depending on the target popu&shy;la&shy;tion, combin&shy;ations of retention interval and
prompting may be used to facilitate recall; however,
manipulations to prompting may not be possible using
auto&shy;mated systems and may impact comparability with other
studies.

Additionally, most participants in the study
preferred the 2h recall compared to 24h recalls admin&shy;istered
using either a web-based interface or via inter&shy;viewers.  It
is possible that multiple 2h recalls spread across days and
times of day could be used to estimate intake somewhat more
accurately than repeated 24hrs while reducing participant
burden.
<p></p>
Portion-size measurement aids (PSMAs) can also help
facilitate accurate recall.  Aids may be photographic or
non-photographic (Section&nbsp;3.2.2) and range from
1&#8209;dimensional to 3&#8209;dimensional

<span data-tippy-content="Amoutzopoulos, B., Page, P., Roberts, C., Roe, M.,

Aids available as a range of graduated portions may reduce
portion size measurement error.  In such cases, a series of
graduated food models or photographs of a range of portion
sizes can be used.  Systems such as ASA24 and NDSR also
integrate recipe features with the aim of capturing
dietary intake more accurately

Data from 24h recalls can be used to examine
contextual details, such as with whom meals were eaten,
when, and where.  These details may be impacted by imperfect
recall.  Most validation research focuses on the accuracy of

contextual details.  Given increasing attention to meal

additional attention to the
accuracy with which these details are reported may be warranted.
<p></p>
Intake reported using methods like the food frequency
question&shy;naire that prompt participants to retro&shy;spectively
report intake over a longer period, such as a year, are also
reliant on memory.  Probes are also useful for this method,
which relies mainly on generic versus specific memory.
Nonetheless, the cognitive demands associated with
remembering what was consumed can be exacerbated by the
requirement to average consumption of a given food over a
long period.  Frequency question&shy;naires may also require
respondents to consider multiple similar foods captured by
one line item on the question&shy;naire that may be consumed with
varying frequencies.  Estimating average consumption over
time may be especially difficult for foods that vary in
availability according to season.  Some food frequency
question&shy;naires therefore include questions related to
seasonal food consumption (Section&nbsp;3.1.4) to reduce recall
bias.
<p></p>
Food records (Section&nbsp;3.1.2) completed in real time-that is,
at the time of consumption-may be subject to some recall
bias if details, such as the level of fat or type of
sweeteners in a food in a packed lunch, are not accurately
remembered.  If records are completed at the end of the
record keeping period rather than in real time, they become
like 24h recalls in terms of relying on retro&shy;spective
reporting and can be affected more substantially by recall bias.
<p></p>
Recall bias is not consistent across individuals and may be
more pronounced among children who have not yet fully
developed their cognitive abilities, including memory, and
individuals who have cognitive limitations.  For this
reason, it is important to carefully tailor the assess&shy;ment
method used with the target popu&shy;la&shy;tion; for instance, young
children are unlikely to be able to accurately complete a
24h recall on their own and proxy- or proxy-assisted
reporting may be needed.

<h3>5.2.2	Social desirability bias</h3>
<p></p>
Reported intake may be affected by social desirability
biases, the tendency to give responses perceived as socially
desirable, and social approval biases, the tendency to seek praise

For example, prompting during
24h recalls and food lists within food frequency
question&shy;naires that focus on foods perceived as desirable or
undesirable may elicit this source of bias.  Social
desirability bias may be intentional or a form of self-deception

vege&shy;tables and sweet foods are particularly susceptible to
social approval needs and hence are a potential source of
system&shy;atic bias through over- or under-reporting.  With

foods such as sources of free and added sugars

these items may be prone to
increasing social desirability bias over time, with
implications for monitoring trends in intake and evaluating
the impact of dietary guidance and other policy initiatives.

persons living in larger bodies given the stigmatization of
overweight and obesity in many societies

The researchers also found that the bias was
not consistent over time, with women randomized to an
inter&shy;vention reporting intake with higher bias at follow-up
versus baseline, whereas bias among men was higher at
baseline.  Miller et&nbsp;al.

also found substantial social approval bias affecting data collected
from women using a short frequency question&shy;naire and a
limited 24h recall focused on fruit and vege&shy;table intake.
Participants were exposed to messaging about the benefits of
and guidelines for consumption of fruits and vege&shy;tables.
<p></p>
Similarly, analyses of baseline data collected from women
enrolled in the Special Supple&shy;mental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and participating in a
nutrition education inter&shy;vention related to fruits and
vege&shy;tables found that higher social desirability trait,
measured using a short version of the Marlowe-Crowne Social
Desirability Scale, was associated with higher reported
frequency of consumption of fruits and vege&shy;tables but only
among women who were not breast&shy;feeding

These studies used short tools focused on foods that
may be particularly affected by social desirability bias
(i.e., knowledge about the benefits of and recom&shy;mend&shy;ations
for fruit and vege&shy;table consumption are widespread).
Additional studies considering other types of foods and
beverages would be beneficial for expanding knowledge in
this area.

When an inter&shy;vention group is compared to a control
group, this differential reporting-that is, reporting error
that is different in the inter&shy;vention group compared to the
control group-may mask the effects of the inter&shy;vention.

Collaborating with cognitive psychologists to expand
under&shy;standing of the implications of social desirability and
social approval biases, along with other psychosocial
factors, may inform strategies to modify methods and/or
analytic methods to reduce the impacts of these sources of
measurement errors.  The use of a social desirability scale
in dietary surveys to identify and perhaps control for
social desirability variables has been suggested

bias and the popu&shy;la&shy;tions and dietary components for which it

<p></p>
Given the potential impact of social desirability bias on
capacity to evaluate inter&shy;ventions, data aside from or in
addition to self-reported intake are recommended.  Depending
on the inter&shy;vention, such data may come from direct
observation, biomarkers, or food purchasing records, though
to date, there has been relatively little attention to
analytic methods to combine such sources of data to evaluate
an inter&shy;vention

<p></p>
<h3>5.2.3	Reactivity bias</h3>
<p></p>
In contrast to methods that query intake retro&shy;spectively,
those that involve real-time recording, such as food
records, can elicit reactivity.  Reactivity is defined as a
change in behavior due to awareness that behavior is being
or will be measured (Section&nbsp;3.1.2).  The respondent may
modify their food consumption during the reporting period,
potentially in a more socially desirable manner and/or to
simplify the recording task

<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31920966/"
target="right" >Burrows et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>). </span>

<p></p>
To minimize reactivity, 24h recalls
are generally intended to be unannounced such that the
respondent does not know they will be asked to complete the
recall on a given day.  In some web-based recall systems, a
scheduling option allows for researchers to invite
respondents to complete their recalls on given days and to
prevent recalls from being completed on other days.  In
situations in which the respondent knows that a recall is
upcoming or can choose the day on which to complete a
recall, reactivity bias may be a nontrivial contributor to
the overall system&shy;atic error.
<p></p>
For food records, reactivity may be a desired outcome of
self-monitoring as part of an inter&shy;vention aimed at changing
eating practices and/or body weight

target="right" >Tinker et&nbsp;al., 2001</a>). </span>

However, when inter&shy;ventions such as
counselling are being evaluated for their ability to change
intake, food records are not recommended for evaluating the
inter&shy;vention

<span data-tippy-content="National Cancer Institute. (2015). Dietary Assessment Primer.">
(<a href="https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/"
target="right" >National Cancer Institute, 2015</a>), </span>

as discussed in Section&nbsp;5.2.2, because of challenges in
differentiating changes in reported intake due to the
inter&shy;vention from changes in reported intake due to
reactivity.
<p></p>
In studies with repeated admin&shy;istrations of dietary
assess&shy;ment methods, it is possible that reactivity may
decline over time as the novelty of monitoring wears off.
However, it is challenging to distinguish changes in this
source of bias from other biases and factors, such as
practice effects, that may be dynamic across repeat
admin&shy;istrations.
<p></p>
<h3>5.2.4	Interviewer biases</h3>
<p></p>
Errors in reported dietary intake can also come about due to
inter&shy;viewer biases

<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19762354/"
target="right" >Davis et&nbsp;al., 2010</a>). </span>

These biases are most pertinent to 24h recalls, which continue to
be inter&shy;viewer admin&shy;istered in many studies and national surveys

though this is changing, as
noted in Section&nbsp;5.2.1. Interviewer biases can be
random across days and respondents, and/or system&shy;atic for a
specific inter&shy;viewer, or they may exist as an inter&shy;action
between certain inter&shy;viewers and certain respondents

Interviewer biases may include errors
caused by incorrect use of probing questions, incorrect
recording of responses, intentional omissions, biases
associated with the inter&shy;view setting, and distractions

The degree of rapport between
the inter&shy;viewer and the respondent can also play a role, for
example, lending to the extent to which a respondent
exhibits social desirability bias.  Relatedly, mode of
admin&shy;istration is relevant, with auditory and visual cues in
face-to-face inter&shy;views potentially leading to larger
inter&shy;view bias compared to telephone inter&shy;views

and gender identity, can also play a role, as can the use of
inter&shy;viewers with limited characteristics (e.g., only women)

When several inter&shy;viewers are employed, the
assignment of inter&shy;viewers-respondents-days should be
randomized, and the inter&shy;viewers should be trained to
anticipate and recognize potential sources of distortion and bias

In situations in which inter&shy;viewers

For dietary surveys involving diverse groups, it is
advisable to use inter&shy;viewers familiar with each language
and culture.  However, care must be taken to ensure that
individual inter&shy;viewers are not assigned only to specific
subgroups of the target popu&shy;la&shy;tion, as inter&shy;viewer and group
effects can become confounded.  Special attention must be
given to the way the questions are asked, and how people
think about and describe foods and amounts consumed in each
ethnic or cultural group

Comparing nutrient intakes calculated from multiple inter&shy;views carried
out independently on the same participants during the same
24h eating period, using different trained inter&shy;viewers, may
reveal inter&shy;viewer effects.  Despite rigorous efforts to
standardize a computer-assisted 24h recall method used in
the European prospective investigation into cancer and
nutrition (EPIC), an inter&shy;viewer effect was observed in
certain countries among the 90&nbsp;inter&shy;viewers involved in the
collection of approximately 37,000 24h recalls

mean energy intake per inter&shy;viewer, considering the
confounding effects of age, body mass index, energy
requirements, weekday, season, special diet, and physical

<h3>5.2.5	Coding errors</h3>
<p></p>
Processing food consumption data to enable estimation of
intake of energy, nutrients, and other dietary components
involves coding each item reported using a food compo&shy;sition
data&shy;base (Chapter&nbsp;4) and depending on the nature of the
data, the quantity (portion size) or frequency of intake

Coding may be an overlooked potential source of error.

arising exclusively from inadequate descriptions of foods
rather than weight error resulted in coefficients of
variation ranging from 3% for protein and 8% for total fat

outlined a system&shy;atic method to examine
discrepancies in coding, applying manual verification of
codes applied to a 1% random sample of diet histories to
develop a classification system outlining the types of
discrepancies encountered.  Discrepancy types included minor
derivations not affecting food and nutrient intake
estimation, incorrect codes affecting food and nutrient
intake estimation, missing codes, and codes applied without
corresponding foods and beverages reported in the diet
histories.  The classification system was then applied to a
random sample of diet histories, revealing that
discrepancies were most common for vege&shy;tables, followed by
meats, sauces and condiments, and cereals.  In one case,
four slices of cheese were recorded in the diet history but
coded as four cups.  There were also errors in coding the
frequency of consumption over the period queried by the diet
history.  The authors note the need to tailor the data entry
and quality control procedures to the nature of the data
being collected

Errors in coding foods
have been reduced by auto&shy;mating and integrating the data
collection and coding processes and by allowing food codes
to be generated auto&shy;matically by the coder selecting the
food item from a computer-based pull-down menu.  Both these
strategies were used for identifying and describing foods in
the EPIC-SOFT program used for the EPIC study, in an effort
to minimize subjective inter&shy;pretations and coding error.
First, a predefined country-specific list of foods, recipes,
and dietary supple&shy;ments was compiled

These lists also included "nonspecified" generic foods which
were used when respondents were not able to describe the
foods adequately.  Use of these generic foods minimized

Systems can be designed to check for outliers arising from
errors in entering portions, as well as for missing
information, while the respondent is still present or prior
to data analysis.  For example, in EPIC-SOFT, energy and
macronutrient intakes from the 24h recall were calculated
immediately after the inter&shy;view.  Calculated values were
then checked against standard requirements based on the
respondent's age, sex, weight, and height.  Such a strategy
limits a posteriori arbitrary decisions on outlier values or
unlikely food data

Systems like ASA24 provide researchers with information on the number of
foods reported and total energy intake for a given recall to
support data quality appraisal.  In addition to potentially
reviewing open-text entries, researchers using ASA24 are
encouraged to review their data for outliers to identify
possible data entry or conversion errors prior to analysis

<b>Consider&shy;ations in coding eating occasions and foods consumed
in combin&shy;ation</b>
<p></p>
Discrepancies in coding meals or eating occasions can also
occur and can be avoided by standardizing the codes prior to
the study, and by adhering to their assignment.  In the
EPIC-SOFT program, the 24h recall period was divided into 11
common food consumption occasions during the day from
"breakfast" to "after dinner" and during the night.  A
checklist was also devised and was adapted to the local
dietary habits of each participating country, so that the
inter&shy;viewer could ensure that no major component of the food
consumption occasion was forgotten

also compared the frequency of and energy intake from eating
occasions, based on whether they were participant
identified, based on time of day, or based on time intervals
and/or energy criterion.  The authors found that the
different definitions affect how eating patterns are
characterized and suggested that consensus on a standard
definition of eating occasions is needed

applied individual food codes to
each individual item, as per AMPM, and then recoded items
consumed together, such as coffee with milk or the multiple
ingredients in a sandwich, using combin&shy;ation codes.  In both
cases, codes were aggregated into food groups based on the
main food component.  The difference in coding led to
variation in the frequency of consumption of food groups and
their rank order, with differences by racial identity also
varying depending on the coding approach.  Considering
combin&shy;ation versus individual codes also resulted in
differences in how snacks were characterized

<b>Consider&shy;ations in the handling of mixed dishes</b>
<p></p>
Errors may also come about in coding mixed dishes.  First,
error may occur during when mixed dishes are broken into raw
ingredients and converted to an "as consumed" form.  The
conversion usually involves applying adjust&shy;ment factors for
changes in weight due to cooking and for nutrient retention.
These adjust&shy;ment factors are generally derived from the
literature and are discussed in Chapter&nbsp;4. After applying
the appropriate adjust&shy;ments, the "as consumed" form is used,
along with the estimate of the quantity of the mixed dish
consumed by the respondent.
<p></p>
The assignment of the mixed dish to an appropriate food
group may also result in errors.  To assess alignment of
dietary intake with food group recom&shy;mend&shy;ations, mixed dishes
should be broken down, or disaggregated, into simple
ingredients (i.e., single foods), which can then be
classified.  Within this approach, it is necessary to define
system&shy;atically which items should be classified as prepared
foods per se (i.e., bread, biscuits, soup, drinks) and not
broken down into ingredients

Assigning mixed dishes to food groups based on the primary
ingredient may yield incorrect estimates for the
contribution of major food groups to energy and nutrient
intakes.  For example, the fat and oil group may more than
double its energy contribution from 5% to 12% when mixed
dishes are incorrectly assigned in this way

<p></p>
Misestimation of energy intake has been a focus of
the dietary assess&shy;ment literature.  In addition to the
emphasis on weight and weight change within the field more
broadly, this focus is likely because error in estimation of
energy is relatively large relative to error in other
dietary components

they report foods and beverages consumed and the

misestimated-using food compo&shy;sition data&shy;bases (Chapter&nbsp;4).

Underestimation of usual energy intakes may come about both
due to under&shy;recording and under&shy;eating.  Underrecording is a
failure to record all the items consumed during the study
period or under&shy;estimating their amounts.  It is a
discrepancy between reported energy intake and measured
energy expenditure without any change in body mass.
Undereating occurs when respondents eat less than usual or
less than required to maintain body weight and is
accompanied by a decline in body mass

Although generally not as prevalent as
under&shy;estimation, overestimation of energy intake also
occurs.  The different impacts of inaccurate reporting
should both be considered in inter&shy;preting study findings,
but there is often more attention to under&shy;estimation.

Studies also suggest that misreporting is
associated with weight status, socioeconomic status, and sex
(Chapter&nbsp;7).
<p></p>
Efforts to overcome the problem of energy misestimation have
led some investigators to exclude presumed under&shy;reporters
from the data set, using techniques discussed in Chapter&nbsp;7.
Such an approach introduces a source of unknown bias into
the data set and is not recommended.  Further, energy is
only one dietary component and other dietary components of
interest, including nutrient densities, are not subject to
the same level of error

Therefore, corrections for low energy intake are not
sufficient to eliminate the biases arising from selective
misreporting of certain food types (e.g., foods of low
social desirability).  Others advocate the inclusion of data
from all respondents, but the use of statistical methods
that control for energy intake.  Several approaches to
energy adjust&shy;ment exist

Beverages appeared to be omitted less frequently than other
items, but estimation of their portion sizes was less
accurate.  Foods like desserts and snacks did not appear to
be omitted more frequently than foods like fruits and
vege&shy;tables.  Rather, errors in estimation appeared to be
related to their form, e.g., meat in slices or as single
units and vege&shy;tables and condiments as part of mixed dishes,

that omissions tend to be items that are less visible to

<h3>5.3.2	Portion size misestimation</h3>
<p></p>
The errors associated with quantifying the portion of food
consumed are probably the largest measurement error in most
dietary assess&shy;ment methods.  They can arise from the
respondent's inability to quantify accurately the amount of
food consumed, or from misconceptions of an "average"
portion size.

Due to the considerable challenge that portion size
estimation presents for accurately estimating dietary
intake, it continues to be an area of innovation within the
field.  Several types of portion-size measurement aids
(PSMAs) have been developed in an effort to enhance the
accuracy of portion size estimates when weighing methods
cannot be used.  Amoutzopoulos et&nbsp;al. conducted a system&shy;atic
review of PSMAs

that the measurement aids most often used were 2&#8209; and

In all cases, measurement aids that depict a range of portion sizes should
be used to avoid the tendency to "direct" responses.
<p></p>
Photographs and digital images are being increasingly used
to assist respondents in estimating portion sizes; several
approaches have been used and are discussed in Section&nbsp;3.2.2.
Photographs that depict a range of portion sizes are
often used to aid in the estimation of portion size in 24h
recalls and food frequency question&shy;naires.  Photographs and
images for quantifying portion sizes should be standardized
with respect to several factors.  Graduated food models and
household measures have been used in several national food
consumption surveys.  USDA uses three-dimensional measuring

In view of these findings, the use of standard reference
portion sizes in food frequency question&shy;naires is still
hotly debated.  Some investigators have argued that because
variations in food intake are mainly determined by frequency
of consumption, obtaining information on portion sizes in
semiquantitative food frequency question&shy;naires is not always justified

Japanese investigators have cautioned that the relative contributions
of within- and between-person variations in portion size
vary among food items, so that whether separate questions on
portion size should be included will depend on the food
groups relevant to the diet-disease association being studied

Not considering supple&shy;ment usage could also result in under&shy;estimation of the

Assess&shy;ing supple&shy;ment usage requires unique consider&shy;ations
compared to food because supple&shy;ments may be consumed daily
or episodically, with usage varying substantially over time,
and can provide high levels of nutrients that are not
associated with energy intake

The U.K.  National Diet and Nutrition Survey of people aged
65y or over obtained information on supple&shy;ment usage from
responses on a health and lifestyle question&shy;naire and a 7d
weighed diet record.  A comparison of the total nutrient
intakes and the corresponding blood biochemical indices
suggested that the 7d record was not long enough to record
habitual dietary supple&shy;ment use.  Instead, a structured
question&shy;naire probing for supple&shy;ment use over a longer
period was recommended.  This included close-ended questions
about the specific brand taken, the amount per pill, the
frequency of use, and the duration of use

These investigators also emphasized that measurement error
associated with long-term supple&shy;mental vitamin and mineral
intake may be responsible for the lack of any observed
association between vitamin supple&shy;ments and the risk of
cancer.  Since 2007, NHANES has included the collection of
dietary supple&shy;ment information at the end of the 24h
recalls, in addition to an inventory and in-home
question&shy;naire that collects information on amounts typically
taken, frequency of use in the past 30 days, and motivation
for taking the supple&shy;ment

Accurate information on brand names is critical for dietary
supple&shy;ments because inter-brand variability is large.
Failure to correctly quantify the dose of a supple&shy;ment can
have a greater impact on the estimation of nutrient intakes
than from any source of food intake under&shy;reporting.
Additionally, the chemical form of the dietary supple&shy;ments
can affect their bioavailability, so it is preferable to
record the chemical characteristics of the dietary
supple&shy;ments, whenever possible

<b>Children</b>
<p></p>
The accurate assess&shy;ment of dietary intake in children is
especially challenging.  Children tend to have diets that
are highly variable from day to day, and their food
practices often change markedly across life stages.
Research on the development and timing of specific cues that
may help children report their diets more accurately,
applying a cognitive-processing approach, has been conducted

concluded that children aged 5-7 y were unable to provide an

when they consumed a dinner provided by the school rather
than eating their own packed lunch, as shown in Figure 5.2.
Nevertheless, prompts and cues enhanced recall by
all children in this study.  Main dishes were

have noted that the
retention interval and level of probing, which can both be
determined by the researcher depending on the recall
protocol or system used, interact to influence the accuracy
of reporting among children.
Furthermore, the level of accuracy in relation to different
combin&shy;ations of retention intervals and types of prompting
differed by gender.
<p></p>
<h2>5.4	Minimizing measurement error through data collection procedures</h2>
<p></p>
Measurement error can be minimized by incorporating
quality-control procedures into each stage of the dietary
assess&shy;ment method.  These procedures include standardization
of inter&shy;viewing techniques and question&shy;naire, robust
training of inter&shy;viewers and coders, pretesting of
question&shy;naires, and admin&shy;istration of a pilot study.  Each
procedure must be checked continuously to ensure compliance
with standardized protocols.
<p></p>
The existence of measurement
error continues to be a major challenge in nutrition
surveillance and research and provides an ongoing impetus
for innovation in dietary assess&shy;ment.  Technology-enabled
methods, such as online recalls incorporating multiple
passes and auto&shy;mated coding and web-based food frequency
question&shy;naires integrating auto&shy;mated skip patterns, are
increasingly used.  It remains important to consider what is
known about the validity and repro&shy;ducibility of a given
method for the popu&shy;la&shy;tion of interest and to integrate a
pilot study to ensure the method performs as intended and to
identify opportunities to reduce error.
<p></p>
Random error,
unlike system&shy;atic error, can be minimized by increasing the
number of observations.  Random error may occur across all
respondents and all intake days.  In contrast, systematic
error may be more common and/or larger among some
respondents (e.g., individuals in larger bodies), in data
collected by specific inter&shy;viewers or using different
methods, or for certain foods (e.g., alcohol).  Systematic
error may be mitigated by ensuring that the methods used,
such as frequency question&shy;naires, are appropriately tailored
to the popu&shy;la&shy;tion group(s) of interest, as well as by
calibrating data to a more accurate method admin&shy;istered in
at least a subsample.
<p></p>
As noted, measurement error can be accounted for or
mitigated if repeat admin&shy;istrations (random error) or
reference data from another method (system&shy;atic error) are
available.  It is ideal if these data are available for a
random subsample of the overall sample of interest but in
some cases, estimates from an external sample with similar
characteristics can be used.
<p></p>
<h2>5.3	Summary</h2>
<p></p>
This chapter outlines the system&shy;atic and random error that
may occur during the collection and recording of food
consumption data.  In practice, different types of error
compound to impact the overall accuracy of reported
consumption and estimated intake of nutrients and other
dietary components.  For example, errors in portion size
quantification may counteract or exacerbate the impact of
omissions of foods and beverages consumed on nutrient intake
estimates.
<p></p>
Quality-control procedures that minimize possible sources of
measurement error include training the inter&shy;viewing and
coding staff and developing standard inter&shy;viewing techniques
and question&shy;naires during the pilot survey.  Increasingly,
sources of error arising from both respondent and
inter&shy;viewer biases and respondent memory lapses can be
reduced using computerized probing questions, standardized
prompts, and built-in cues during auto&shy;mated dietary
inter&shy;views, as well as technology-enabled methods.
Nevertheless, misestimation of energy and selective
misreporting of certain food types remain important sources
of respondent biases.  A variety of portion-size measurement
aids are now available for use when weighing methods are not
possible.  These include the use of 2-D graduated food
models, photographs, and images and 3-D measurement guides
(e.g., household measures) to quantify portions of foods
consumed.  Training respondents to use these measurement
guides to estimate food portion sizes will also improve
accuracy.  Collection of accurate data on consumer use of
dietary supple&shy;ments is also essential; information on brand,
dosage, chemical form, and period over which use of the
dietary supple&shy;ment has been recorded is required.

Establishing a computerized standard coding system for both
foods and eating occasions to avoid coding error is
critical, especially for surveillance and cross-country
comparisons.  Systematic detection of wrongly coded weights
of foods is more difficult, although calculation of energy
and macronutrient intakes from 24h recall inter&shy;views, while
the respondent is still present, allows the correction of
any gross error.  Finally, care must be taken in the
handling of data for mixed dishes and foods eaten in
combin&shy;ation.  Despite all efforts to minimize sources of
random and system&shy;atic error that may occur during the
measurement of food and nutrient intakes, some errors remain
difficult to predict and to prevent and, as a result, may
introduce differential bias in reported food intakes.
Ongoing research is needed to investigate the specific type
and nature of measurement error, especially in diverse
popu&shy;la&shy;tions, so that these can be minimized or corrected
statistically.  In this way, the analysis and inter&shy;pretation
of dietary data can be improved.  The existence of dietary
measurement error distorts estimates of disease relative
risk, and thus has major implications for epidemiological
studies of dietary risk factors and disease.  Observed
diet-disease relationships should be inter&shy;preted cautiously
