<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
This chapter describes the evolving process of
setting nutrient reference values (NRVs) from a&nbsp;single
value to a&nbsp;multi-level approach designed to address multiple
users and needs. This multi-level approach with some
modifications has been adopted by several authoritative
groups. However, discrepancies in the terminology and
methodologies has led to an initiative to develop a&nbsp;
four-step framework for harmonizing the process for
deriving two core NRVs. The feasibility of the
proposed framework has been tested with
three exemplar micronutrients (zinc, iron, folate) on
two high-risk pop&shy;ula&shy;tion sub&shy;groups &mdash; young children and
women of reproductive age. The framework can be applied
across countries and a&nbsp;variety of pop&shy;ula&shy;tion sub&shy;groups,
while taking into account culturally and context-specific
food choices and dietary patterns. Derivation of the two core
NRVs depicted in the framework &mdash; the Average
Requirement (AR) and Safe Upper Level of Intake
(UL)  &mdash;  is presented here. Details of additional
NRVs used are also described. They include
the Recom&shy;mended Intake (RI) (analogous to the RDA or RNI)
used to guide intakes of indi&shy;viduals, the Lower Reference Intake
(equivalent to the AR&nbsp;&minus;2SD), and a&nbsp;Safe or
Ade&shy;quate Intake value used when insufficient information is
available to set an AR. Details of the different methods
used to establish recom&shy;men&shy;dations for energy and
macro&shy;nutrients are also described. A&nbsp;review of 
the NRVs currently in use by the
United Kingdom, USA and Canada, European Union,
and WHO/FAO is also presented, together with the potential sources of
discrepancy. In a&nbsp;final section under &ldquo;Future directions&rdquo;, reasons for harmonizing the process to derive NRVs globally are emphasized together with the six core values considered essential for the success of this initiative.

	<h2 id="8a.1"> 8a.1 Development of Nutrient Reference Values</h2>
	
The first set of nutrient reference values (NRVs) was produced
by the Technical Commission on Nutrition, League of Nations,

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="League of Nations. (1938).  Report by the Technical Commission on Nutrition as the work of its third session.  Bulletin of the League of Nations Health Organization 7:  461&ndash;492.    ">
(<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/279926"
target="right" >1938</a>).</span>	

The recom&shy;men&shy;dations of this Commission formed the basis for the first
Canadian Dietary Standard compiled by the Canadian Council on Nutrition

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Canadian Council on Nutrition. (1940).  The Canadian Dietary Standard.  National Health Review 8:  1&ndash;9. ">
(<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/canada-food-guide/about/history-food-guide.html"
target="right" >1940</a>).</span>

The United States Food and Nutrition Board

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Recom&shy;mended Dietary Allowances.  National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, Washington, DC. ">
(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234932/"
target="right" >in 1943</a>)</span>

prepared the first U.S. Recom&shy;mended Dietary
Allowances (RDAs) for protein, energy, and eight vitamins and
minerals.  This was followed by
periodic revisions of the U.S RDAs and a&nbsp;number of joint
publications by the World Health Organization / Food and
Agriculture Organization on recom&shy;men&shy;dations for different
groups of nutrients

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Fao/Who Handbook on Human Nutritional Requirements, 1974, Nutrition Reviews, Volume 33, Issue 5, May 1975, Pages 147â€“157,">
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-4887.1975.tb07110.x"
target="right" >FAO/WHO, 1974</a>;  </span>

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="FAO/WHO (Food and Agriculture Organization / 
World Health Organization). (1988).  Requirements of Vitamin&nbsp;A, Iron, Folate and Vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>. FAO Food and Nutrition Series No.23. FAO, Rome. ">

target="right" >FAO/WHO, 1988</a>).</span>

By 1989, the U.S&nbsp;RDAs included 25&nbsp;vitamins 
and minerals in addition to protein and energy.
<p></p>
Until this time, these reports provided a&nbsp;single estimate of
require&shy;ments (i.e., the RDA or equivalent) that was sufficient to
meet the needs of almost all indi&shy;viduals in a&nbsp;specific life-stage
group. Nevertheless, despite being set for indi&shy;viduals, the RDAs
were being applied to pop&shy;ula&shy;tion data and used for many
different purposes. This misuse of the RDA led to the
development of new approaches to address multiple
users and needs. The first country to adopt a&nbsp;framework that
embraced three nutrient reference levels was the United Kingdom

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="COMA (Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy). (1991). Dietary reference values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom.

target="right" >COMA,1991</a>) </span>

(Section&nbsp;8a.4). This was followed
by the release by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board
(FNB) of a&nbsp;new paradigm of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Interpretation and Uses of Dietary Reference Intakes; Institute of Medicine (US) Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes.

target="right" >National Academic Press, 2000</a>).</span>

Their approach, developed jointly by the U.S. and Canada, also
provided multiple reference levels for each nutrient and included
for the first time an upper intake value (UL) as well as the
concept of reducing the risk of chronic diseases
<p></p>
This new multi-level approach was soon adopted with some
modifications by other authoritative bodies worldwide,
including in China; Korea and Southeast Asia; Germany, Austria,
Switzerland; Australia and New Zealand; and Mexico.  Most
established an Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) and a
RDA (or equivalent) at two standard deviations above the EAR, although the exact
terms used differed. Some authorities also included a  
Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for certain
nutrients, and in many cases, a&nbsp;safe 
or ade&shy;quate intake value (or range) when
insufficient information was available to set an EAR

target="right" >King et&nbsp;al., 2007</a>).</span>
<p></p>
One of the latest developments includes the intro&shy;duction of a
systematic review process to identify data relevant to the
derivation of NRVs. This initiative was introduced in 2007 by the
EURopean micronutrient RECommendations Aligned
(EURRECA) Network of Excellence (NoE)

and used in the U.S. and Canada for the first time for the revision of the
NRVs for vitamin&nbsp;D and calcium

target="right" >IOM, 2011</a>).</span>

More recently, efforts have been made to
overcome some of the challenges encountered when setting
nutrient reference values for chronic disease prevention; these
efforts are on-going

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Yetley, E. A., MacFarlane, A. J., Greene-Finestone, L. S., Garza, C., Ard, J. D., Atkinson, S. A., Bier, D. M., Carriquiry, A. L., Harlan, W.

<p></p>
There is now considerable interest in providing a&nbsp;framework
for harmonizing the process to derive NRVs that can be
applied across countries and a&nbsp;variety of pop&shy;ula&shy;tion
sub&shy;groups, while taking into account culturally and
context-specific food choices and dietary patterns.
This international harmonizing initiative first began in 2005
with the development and
publication of several background review papers
and a&nbsp;consensus report on &ldquo;Harmonization 
of nutrient intake values&rdquo;

The first harmo&shy;nization initiative was followed a&nbsp;decade later
with an inter&shy;national workshop convened in 2017
by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine (NASEM) in partnership with WHO and FAO
to explore the evidence for achieving global harmonization
of method&shy;ological approaches to derive NIVs across countries;
see NASEM

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. (2018). Global Harmonization of method&shy;ological Approaches to Nutrient Intake Recommendations: Proceedings of a&nbsp;Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press.">

for the report of the workshop proceedings. 
(<a href="#table8a.1">Table&nbsp;8a.1</a>).
<a id="table8a.1"></a>
At this workshop,
the term Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs) was adopted
to describe collectively the nutrient intake recom&shy;men&shy;dations 
and is analogous to terms
currently in use such as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)
in the United States and Canada and

Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) in the United Kingdom
and the European Union.
<p></p>
Recom&shy;mendations from the workshop for the terms for
three reference values and the relationship between them is shown in

<a href="#figure8a.1">Figure&nbsp;8a.1</a>.
<a id="figure8a.1"></a>
  
The three reference values are: the Average Requirement (AR),
Recom&shy;mended Intake (RI), and
Safe Upper intake level (UL).

Of these, both the AR and UL are used
to plan, assess, and evaluate nutrient intakes at the
pop&shy;ula&shy;tion level, whereas the RI is the appropriate reference
to use for the assessment and planning of intakes for an
indi&shy;vidual. However, when there is insufficient evidence to
set an AR, then an Adequate Intake (AI) is derived based on observed or
experimentally deter&shy;mined estimates for an appar&shy;ently healthy
pop&shy;ula&shy;tion. For more details of the derivation of these
core reference values, see Sections&nbsp;8a.2.4 for AR and
Section&nbsp;8a.3 for RI and the AI.

<h2>8a.2 Harmo&shy;nization of method&shy;ological approaches
to derive Nutrient Reference Values</h2>

An initial organizing framework for deriving NRVs, developed in the 2005 workshop

This initial organizing
framework empha&shy;sizes on the left the concepts that
serve as the basis for setting the two recom&shy;mended NRVs.
Their uses at both the indi&shy;vidual 
and pop&shy;ula&shy;tion level are shown on the right,
along with other critical health applications of the NRVs.
The two core reference values &mdash; the AR and the UL &mdash;
are prioritized,
from which other reference values are derived.
The indi&shy;vidual recom&shy;mended intake level (RI) is used to guide intakes
at the indi&shy;vidual level,  and is conven&shy;tionally 
set to cover the needs of 98&#37; of  indi&shy;viduals.
<p></p>
Of the two core reference values, the AR is defined as the intake
needed by 50&#37; of a&nbsp;pop&shy;ula&shy;tion sub&shy;group (based on age,
gender, and physio&shy;logical status) to meet a&nbsp;
specific criterion of nutrient ade&shy;quacy. NASEM

emphasize that the AR should:
<ul class="padded">
<li>Be based on the mean nutrient intake of a&nbsp;specific pop&shy;ula&shy;tion;
<li>Be established for all essential nutrients and food components that
have public health relevance;
<li>Include acceptable macro&shy;nutrient distribution ranges for carbohydrates,
protein, and fat that reduce chronic disease risks associated
with the intake of these macro&shy;nutrients;
<li>Consider nutrient-nutrient interactions* and quantify them, if possible;
and
<li>Consider sub&shy;pop&shy;ula&shy;tions with special needs, keeping in mind, however,
that reference values are intended for appar&shy;ently healthy** indi&shy;viduals.
</li></ul>
<p></p>
* Some nutrient-nutrient  interactions are now
known to alter require&shy;ments (e.g., calcium-protein-sodium,
protein-energy;  vitamin&nbsp;E and polyunsaturated fatty acids).
<p></p>
** The term &ldquo;appar&shy;ently healthy&rdquo; has come into question because of the
implication of rising global prevalence of overweight and obesity and
the corresponding increase in chronic disease risk.

report on developing dietary reference intakes
based on chronic disease recommends that for future NRVs,
the health status of the pop&shy;ula&shy;tion should be characterized in
terms of who is included and excluded for each NRV.
<p></p>
The second core reference value &mdash; the UL &mdash; is defined as
the highest level of usual daily nutrient intake that poses
no risk of adverse health effects in most indi&shy;viduals
in the pop&shy;ula&shy;tion and is based on a&nbsp;toxico&shy;log&shy;ical risk
assessment model

For details of the derivation of the AR and UL, see Sections&nbsp;8a.2.4 and 8a.2.5.
<p></p>
Based on the deliberations of a&nbsp;second workshop held in&nbsp;2017 that
reviewed the strengths and weak&shy;nesses of the methods currently
in use, a&nbsp;new framework for harmonizing the process for deriving
the two core nutrient reference values (i.e., AR and UL) was developed.

that shows the four major steps required
to estimate the key NRVs, with the components needed to
complete the steps itemized.

The four steps are:
<ul class="padded">
<li>Choosing the appropriate tools and resources;
<li>Collecting relevant data from the tools and other resources;
<li>Identifying the best approach for the nutrient under consideration; and
<li>Deriving the two core nutrient reference values, the average require&shy;ment (AR)
and the tolerable Upper Limit (UL).
</li></ul>
<p></p>
The feasibility of this proposed harmo&shy;nization framework was
tested using three exemplar nutrients&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;zinc, iron, and folate,
nutrients of concern for young children and women of
reproductive age; for more details, see NASEM

<h3>8a.2.1 Choosing the appropriate tools and resources</h3>

The primary tools and resources needed to develop the NRVs
are: systematic reviews, compre&shy;hensive data&shy;bases, and
information about relevant local and regional factors that can
influence the NRVs, as shown in <a href="#figure8a.3">Figure&nbsp;8a.3</a>.  The EURECCA
network applied the systematic review process to
identify data relevant to the derivation of NRVs, using six
micronutrients as examples; see

model is described in Box&nbsp;8a.1.

In addition to using the PICO/PECO model, construction of a

serum or tissue nutrient concentrations, (non-validated) intermediate

<p></p>
 The analytic framework describes the relationships between
&ldquo;exposure&rdquo; (i.e., nutrient intake) and out&shy;comes of interest, and
helps to emphasize what aspects are known and unknown.
Note that the analytic framework should be
modified to reflect the under&shy;lying biological factors associated
with a&nbsp;specific nutrient, the life-stage group, and the reference
value of interest (i.e., AR or UL). For example, if the AR is the
reference value of interest, then the out&shy;come could be a&nbsp;clinical
or health condition or a&nbsp;surrogate bio&shy;marker (preferably 
a&nbsp;functional bio&shy;marker of nutrient status) associated with
deficiency of the nutrient, whereas for the UL, the clinical or
health condition or surrogate bio&shy;marker associated with nutrient
excess would be selected; see Hooper et&nbsp;al.

<p></p>
The review of the literature for the systematic review should be guided
by the completed PICO elements, associated inclusion criteria,
and the analytic framework for the nutrient, life-stage group, and
NRV of interest.  Quality assessment instruments (QAIs) must be
used to evaluate the evidence at the indi&shy;vidual study level, the
choice depending on the study design. Numerous QAIs are
available.

<h3>8a.2.2 Collecting data from the tools</h3>

The second step is to collect the data generated from the tools that
are essential for selecting the bio&shy;markers of status, surrogate out&shy;comes, and
health/clinical out&shy;comes. Data on the dietary factors with the
potential to influence nutrient bio&shy;avail&shy;ability and the health
factors (e.g., infection) that can affect nutrient require&shy;ments must also be included.

<h3>8a.2.3 Identifying the best approach for deriving the NRVs for
the nutrient of interest</h3>

Once the relevant data have been collated, the evidence appraised
and integrated using the appropriate resources, and any sources
of uncertainty identified, the third step is to identify the best
approach for deriving the NRVs for the nutrient under study.
The decision on which approach to use depends on the
availability of data, and the types and quality of studies reviewed
(Section&nbsp;8a.2.1).
Three approaches are frequently used: factorial approach, balance
studies, and an intake (dose)-response assessment. Limitations of
each of these approaches were noted by Claessens et&nbsp;al.

<b>The factorial approach</b> is currrently used to determine NRVs for iron and zinc,
as in these cases the relationship between
exposure (nutrient intake) and surrogate bio&shy;markers or a
clinical/health out&shy;come is weak or non-existent and cannot be
derived mathematically. Factorial estimates are
derived from the sum of obligatory losses (i.e, through fecal,
urine, skin, menses etc) plus any additional needs for growth and
development (fetus, pregnancy, lactation etc), adjusted by a
bio&shy;avail&shy;ability factor to convert the physio&shy;logical require&shy;ment
into the dietary require&shy;ment

<b>Balance studies</b> are used when no reliable
bio&shy;marker representative of actual nutrient status exists. They measure
input and excretion &mdash; when they are equal it is assumed that the
body is saturated. Additional assumptions are that the size of
the body pool of the nutrient is appropriate, and that increasing
the levels of nutrient intake do not provide additional benefit.
Limitations of balance studies have been reviewed by Mertz

<b>Intake (dose)-response modeling</b>, usually based on randomized controlled

epidem&shy;iological studies, describes how a&nbsp;known physiological
out&shy;come changes according to the exposure (i.e., intake) of a
nutrient. It is used when there is a&nbsp;clear relationship between the
exposure (i.e., intake) of a&nbsp;nutrient and the physio&shy;logical relevant
out&shy;come. The latter may be a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker of function, disease, or
other health out&shy;come (see <a href="#figure8a.4">Figure&nbsp;8a.4</a>). These may differ for a
specific nutrient from one life-stage group to another because the
critical function or the risk of disease may be different.

examining the intake-response relationship for several micronutrients in
relation to health/clinical out&shy;comes or surrogate out&shy;comes
associated with deficiency in order to establish a&nbsp;causal
relationship between nutrient intake and a&nbsp;deficiency disease.
Such relationships can be complex and influenced by many
confounders and effect modifiers (e.g., ethnicity, life-stage group,
body mass index, acute illness, and genotype etc). As noted earlier,
surrogate out&shy;comes are often used in RCTs when the study duration is too
short to show an effect on health or clinical out&shy;comes.
<p></p>
In addition to the focus on the prevention of nutrient deficiency,
intake-response modeling can also be used to determine a&nbsp;safe
upper intake level (i.e., ULs) (Section&nbsp;8a.2.5) and chronic disease
endpoints (Section&nbsp;8a.3).
<p></p>
The final stage is to establish the two core NRVs for the
nutrient(s) of interest and for the defined sex and life-stage group
using the approach selected based on the available evidence. The
two core NRVs are the Average Requirement (AR) together with
the associated distribution of the require&shy;ment, and the UL. 
Strenuous efforts should be made to establish
the AR for each nutrient because it is the basis for the multiple
reference values; details are given below.

<h3>8a.2.4 Deriving the Average Requirement (AR) for a&nbsp;nutrient</h3>

The require&shy;ments for a&nbsp;specific nutrient vary from indi&shy;vidual to
indi&shy;vidual and thus form a&nbsp;distribution of require&shy;ments. 
For most nutrients except iron, this variation in
require&shy;ments is assumed to follow a&nbsp;normal symmetrical
distribution as shown in

<a href="#figure8a.5">Figure&nbsp;8a.5</a>,

valid for a&nbsp;defined level of
nutrient ade&shy;quacy and a&nbsp;specific sex and life-stage group.
Consequently, a&nbsp;coefficient of variation (CV) (i.e., the standard
deviation divided by the mean &times; 100&#37;) can be used to estimate the
variation. In cases where require&shy;ments are not normally
distributed (e.g., iron require&shy;ments for mens&shy;truating adolescent
girls and women of child bearing age), data are transformed to
achieve normality. 
<p></p>
Inter-indi&shy;vidual variability in require&shy;ments is affected by
numerous diet- and host-related factors

target="right" >Gibson, 2012</a>).</span>

However, many of these factors are difficult to measure, or their
impact is unknown. 
Hence, for many nutrients, the distribution of
require&shy;ments is unknown, and instead is assumed to have a&nbsp;CV of
about 10&#37; (i.e., the standard deviation is about 10&#37; of the mean

<h3>8a.2.5 Deriving the Safe Upper Levels of Intake</h3>

The Safe Upper Levels of Intake (ULs) represent daily intakes, that if
consumed chronically over time, will have a&nbsp;very low risk of
causing adverse effects. Intakes from all sources are considered:
food, water, nutrient supplements, and pharmacological agents.
The UL is defined as:
<blockquote>
 &ldquo;The highest level of habitual nutrient intake that is likely to pose
no risk of adverse health effects in almost all indi&shy;viduals in the
general pop&shy;ula&shy;tion

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="King, J. C., & Garza, C. (2007). Harmonization of nutrient intake values. Food and nutrition bulletin, 28(1 Suppl International), S3â€“S12.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17521115"
target="right" >King and Garza, 2007</a>).&rdquo;</span>
</blockquote>

 The ULs are based on a&nbsp;toxico&shy;log&shy;ical risk assessment model
involving a&nbsp;four-step process:
<p></p>
<div class="box">
<b>Box 8a.2:    Four-step toxico&shy;log&shy;ical risk assessment model</b>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>identification of risk of toxicity;
<li>dose-response assessment;
<li>assessment of the prevalence
of intakes outside the reference values; and
<li>characterization of risks associated with excess intake
</li></ul>

</div>

<p></p>
The dose-response assessment is built upon three toxico&shy;log&shy;ical terms:
no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL), and uncertainty factor (UF).
These terms are defined in Box&nbsp;8a.3.
<div class="box">
<b>Box 8a.3:     Dose-response assessment</b>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>NOAEL is the highest continuing intake of a&nbsp;nutrient at
which no adverse effects have been observed in the
indi&shy;viduals or groups studied. In some cases, it may be
derived from experimental studies in animals. When
sufficient data are not available to define a&nbsp;NOAEL, then
a LOAELis defined.

<li>LOAEL is the lowest continuing intake at which an
adverse effect has been identified.

<li>UNCERTAINTY FACTORS (UFs) are used to address
gaps in the data and incomplete knowledge (e.g.,
variability in response within the pop&shy;ula&shy;tion;
extrapolation from experimental animal to human data).
The estimate for the magnitude of the uncertainty factor
for each nutrient should be based on the approach of Renwick et&nbsp;al.

At present, ULs are only set for those nutrients for which there
is strong, high quality evidence. Like ARs, ULs vary by age
and sex and tend to be lower for young children and pregnant
women.  The goal is to have less than 5&#37; of a&nbsp;pop&shy;ula&shy;tion
sub&shy;group with an intake greater than the UL, including intakes
from supplements and fortified foods

<h2>8a.3 A&nbsp;review of Nutrient Reference Values set by the UK, U.S./Canada, European Union, and WHO/FAO</h2>

Before reviewing the NRVs established by each of the four indi&shy;vidual authorities,
it is stressed again that the process of setting nutrient reference values
has evolved from setting a&nbsp;single value, equivalent to the
RI, to specifying multiple reference values.  In  addition to
establishing the two core NRVs &mdash; the Average Requirement (AR) and
Safe Upper Level of Intake (UL) &mdash; for a&nbsp;specific 
nutrient and described in
Sections&nbsp;8a.2.4 and 8a.2.5, other NRVs are often specified and used
for multiple purposes, some with a&nbsp;focus on optimizing health and preventing chronic diseases rather than the prevention of nutritional deficiencies.
The more important of these other NRVs (the RI, LRI, and AI)  are
listed in <a href="#table8a.1">Table&nbsp;8a.1</a> and summarized below.
The reader is advised to consult 
<a href="#table8a.1">Table&nbsp;8a.1</a> for a&nbsp;comparison of the 
recommended terminology with the terms currently
used by these four authorities

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Lupton, J. R., Blumberg, J. B., L'Abbe, M., LeDoux, M., Rice, H. B., von Schacky, C., Yaktine, A., & Griffiths, J. C. (2016).

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26983608"
target="right" >Lupton et&nbsp;al., 2016</a>).</span>
<p></p>
In addition, the problems of setting NRVs for energy and some macro&shy;nutrients, as well as NRVs for Chronic Disease Prevention, have also been faced by all four authorities.   Comments on these difficulties are also considered below.
<p></p>
Nevertheless, many of the principles used previously to define NRVs
remain the same (Box&nbsp;8a.4); see Section&nbsp;8a.2 for more details.
<p></p>
<div class="box">
<b>Box 8a.4:    Underlying principles in defining NRVs</b>
<ul>
<li>Set for a&nbsp;particular group of indi&shy;viduals with
specified characteristics, consuming a&nbsp;specified diet;
</li><li>Refer to the average daily need over a&nbsp;reasonable period
of time, although the latter has seldom been defined;
hence, the suggested amounts do not have to be consumed

</li><li>Refer to levels of intake needed to maintain health in
already healthy indi&shy;viduals; they do not allow for
illnesses or stresses in life;
</li><li>Based on the typical dietary pattern of the country and
may not be appropriate for persons following atypical
diets;
</li><li>Consider possible interactions that involve nutrients
and other dietary components and quantify them, if
possible; and
</li><li>Assume that require&shy;ments for energy and all the other
nutrients are met.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p>
<b>Recommended Intake (RI) </b> (or equivalent) has been 
established by all authoritative groups. The RI is derived from the 
AR and its distribution (<a href="#figure8a.6">Figure&nbsp;8a.6</a>)
and  is used to assess intakes and plan diets for indi&shy;viduals.
Currently, the convention has been to add 2SD to
the observed AR to cover the needs of most (i.e., 98&#37;)
of indi&shy;viduals of the pop&shy;ula&shy;tion.  This means that an indi&shy;vidual
whose intake is equal to RI<sub>98</sub>  (i.e., AR&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;2SD of the AR)
has a&nbsp;98&#37; prob&shy;ability that their intake meets 
their needs (<a href="#figure8a.6">Figure&nbsp;8a.6</a>).
<p></p>
In the initial harmo&shy;nization initiative in 2005

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="King, J. C., & Garza, C. (2007). harmo&shy;nizationof nutrient intake values. Food and nutrition bulletin, 28(1 Suppl International), S3â€“S12.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17521115"
target="right" >King and Garza, 2007</a>)</span>
it was suggested that in the future countries might wish to choose a&nbsp;lower percentile
level deemed to represent an acceptable risk for nutrient inade&shy;quacy
for an indi&shy;vidual in their country instead of the conventional 98&#37; (i.e., RI<sub>98</sub>).
To date, this suggestion has not been adopted.
<p></p>
<b>Lower Reference Intake (LRI)</b> (or equivalent) is also derived from the AR and its distribution and is set at 2&nbsp;SD below the AR for each nutrient. This reference level represents the lowest intake that will meet the needs of some indi&shy;viduals. It has been established only by the UK and EFSA  (<a href="#table8a.1">Table&nbsp;8a.1</a>).
<p></p>
<b>Ade&shy;quate Intake (AI)</b> (or equivalent) is applied when
there is not enough information to
establish an AR for a&nbsp;specific nutrient. The AI
is defined as the
observed or experimentally derived usual intake by a&nbsp;pop&shy;ula&shy;tion
group that appears to sustain health 

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="King, J. C., & Garza, C. (2007). Harmonization of nutrient intake values. Food and nutrition bulletin, 28(1 Suppl International), S3â€“S12.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17521115"
target="right" >King and Garza, 2007</a>).</span>

The methods used to estimate the AIs vary. For example, for infants &lt;&nbsp;6mo,
AIs are generally based on mean nutrient intakes (except vitamin&nbsp;D)
supplied by human milk, whereas for children and adults the
AIs can be derived from observed median intakes from
national survey data, based on limited experimental data,
or in some cases, epidem&shy;iological studies 

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Trumbo PR, Barr SI, Murphy SP, Yates AA. (2013). Dietary reference intakes: cases of appropriate and inappropriate uses. Nutrition Reviews 71(10): 657-664.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24117790"
target="right" >Trumbo et&nbsp; al., 2013</a>).</span>
<p></p>
In general, mean usual nutrient intakes at the pop&shy;ula&shy;tion
level at or above the AI indicate a&nbsp;low prob&shy;ability of inade&shy;quacy.
No assumptions can be made, however, about the prevalence of
inade&shy;quate intakes when the mean intake of a&nbsp;group falls
below the AI. Likewise, if an indi&shy;vidual's usual intake equals or
exceeds the AI, the diet is almost certainly ade&shy;quate but again when
the usual intake of an indi&shy;vidual falls below the AI, no estimate can be made
of the prob&shy;ability of nutrient inade&shy;quacy (IOM, 2000).
As noted previously, the Harmonization
Committee urged that strenuous efforts should be made to
establish an AR for each nutrient so that the inappropriate
use of an AI can be avoided.
 <p></p>
 <b>Energy Requirements </b>are based on the average require&shy;ments (AR)
 for energy of indi&shy;viduals in a
specified sex and life-stage group. The recom&shy;men&shy;dations are
not appropriate for the
definition of require&shy;ments at the indi&shy;vidual level. Adding an
increment equivalent to  2SD to the average
energy require&shy;ment would result in a&nbsp;recom&shy;men&shy;dation that
exceeds require&shy;ments and lead to overweight and obesity over the
long term. Energy require&shy;ments are derived with the
assumption that the require&shy;ments for all other nutrients are met

as:
<blockquote>
&ldquo;The amount of food energy needed to balance energy
expenditure in order to maintain body size, body composition,
and a&nbsp;level of physical activity consistent with long-term good
health. This includes the energy needed for optimal growth and
development of children, for the deposition of tissues during
pregnancy, and for the secretion of milk during lactation
consistent with the good health of mother and child.&rdquo;
</blockquote>
The criterion chosen on which to base the AR for energy is the
total energy expenditure (TEE). When body weight and composition
is stable in normal-weight indi&shy;viduals, the energy require&shy;ment is equal to
TEE . In the past TEE for some life-stage
groups was estimated indirectly by estimating the amount of
energy consumed from self-reported food intakes and
equating it with the amount of energy expended.
This procedure was used by FAO/WHO/UNU

<b>Appropriate Macronutrient Distribution Range</b> (or equivalent)
serves as a&nbsp;guide to the
distribution of percentage energy consumed as protein, fat, and
carbohydrate said to be consistent with both the maintenance of health
and a&nbsp;reduced risk of diet-related chronic disease, while
providing ade&shy;quate levels of essential nutrients. Increasingly,
recom&shy;men&shy;dations are being made for the contri&shy;bution of free
sugars as percentage of  energy from total carbohydrate, as well
as daily intakes of salt, dietary fiber, fruits and vegetables.

<b>NRVs for Chronic Disease Prevention</b> are being developed by several authoritative groups. However, several challenges have been encountered; these  are itemized in Box&nbsp;8a.5:
<p></p>
<div class="box">
<b>Box 8a.5:  Challenges in defining NRVs for chronic disease prevention</b>
<ul>
<li>
 Relationships  between diet and chronic disease are multifactorial in nature, and
dependent on a&nbsp;variety of both nutritional and non-nutritional
factors. These may include baseline risk for chronic disease by an
indi&shy;vidual, nutrient-diet or nutrient-nutrient interactions, and
environmental and other lifestyle factors; 
<li>
Chronic diseases develop over a&nbsp;long period making it
difficult to accurately measure dietary patterns over
 such a&nbsp;long period of exposure;
<li>
Published intervention trials are often
conducted in selected sub&shy;groups, such as indi&shy;viduals with an
already increased risk of disease or history of disease, frequently
with intervention dosages that are relatively high and which have
relatively short follow-up periods.
<li>
Evidence  from observational studies can be compromised by
uncertainty arising from problems of confounding, bias, and
inaccuracy;
<li>
Use of  a&nbsp;validated dietary bio&shy;marker of nutrient exposure
requires an estimate of the nutrient intake
that corresponds with the clinical out&shy;come;
<li>
Challenges arise with the selection of
meaningful and suitable out&shy;come indicators for the chronic
disease or an intermediate surrogate bio&shy;marker as a&nbsp;valid
predictor of the chronic disease.
<li>
Surrogate bio&shy;markers are often required
because the exposure
and out&shy;come are separated by such a&nbsp;long time period that
clinical signs or symptoms may not be observed for many years.
Criteria developed for a&nbsp;qualified surrogate bio&shy;marker are
available in IOM

The generic term &ldquo;Dietary Reference Values&rdquo; was used
to embrace three reference levels:
the &ldquo;Estimated Average Requirement&rdquo; (EAR  &equals;&nbsp;AR),
the &ldquo;Reference Nutrient Intake&rdquo;  (RNI &equals;&nbsp;RI),
and the &ldquo;Lower Reference Nutrient Intake&rdquo; (LRNI, set at 2SDs below the AR).
The term &ldquo;reference values&rdquo; was adopted in an effort to prevent
users interpreting the figures as recom&shy;mended or desirable
intakes. Instead, the expert panel hoped that users would select
the figure most appropriate for its intended use

<h3>8a.4.1    U.K. Estimated Average 
Requirement  (EAR&nbsp;&equals;&nbsp;AR) for nutrients </h3>

The term &ldquo;Estimated Average Requirement&rdquo; (EAR) in

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="COMA (Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy). (1991). Dietary reference values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom. Report of the panel on Dietary Reference Values. Report on Health and Social sub&shy;jects No.41. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London. ">

target="right" >COMA,1991</a> </span> represents the level of
the nutrients estimated to meet the nutrient require&shy;ment
of 50&#37; of the healthy indi&shy;viduals in a&nbsp;particular sex and life-
stage group. The EAR is especially useful for evaluating the possible
ade&shy;quacy of nutrient intakes of pop&shy;ula&shy;tion groups.

<h3>8a.4.2    U.K. Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI)</h3>

Reference Nutrient Intakes (RNIs)  were defined as 2SDs above
the average require&shy;ment for each nutrient and represent the target 
for an indi&shy;vidual's nutrient intake.
The U.K.&nbsp;RNIs for minerals and vitamins are shown in
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="uk-ri-min">

and <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="uk-ri-vit">
<a href="appendix/uk-ri-vit.pdf" 
target="_blank">Appendix&nbsp;8a.2 </a> respectively.</span>
When data about variability in require&shy;ments were insufficient to calculate a
SD, a&nbsp;coefficient of variation for the EAR of 10&#37; was
assumed. Habitual intakes above the RNI<sub>98</sub> will be
ade&shy;quate for all but <span class="n">2&ndash;3&#37;</span>
 of indi&shy;viduals in a&nbsp;specific sex and
life-stage group. The RNI should not be used in relation to groups

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="COMA (Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy). (1991). Dietary reference values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom.

<h3>8a.4.3    U.K. Safe Upper Levels for Nutrients</h3>

Safe upper levels were set by the
 U.K Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals
 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="EVM (Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals).(2003). Safe Upper Levels for Vitamins and Minerals. Food Standards Agency, The Stationery Office, London. ">
(<a href="https://cot.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/vitmin2003.pdf"
target="right" >EVM, 2003</a>)</span>.
 They
represents an intake that can be consumed daily over a&nbsp;lifetime without
significant risk to health. Intakes from all sources were taken into
account.
The EVM group defined ULs for vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub>,  &beta;-carotene,
vitamin&nbsp;E, zinc, copper, selenium, boron and silicon, and  also provided guidance for those nutrients for
which the data&shy;base was inade&shy;quate to establish a&nbsp;UL.
Nutrients in this category included biotin, folic acid,
niacin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid,  thiamin, vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>,
vitamin&nbsp;A, vitamin&nbsp;C, vitamin&nbsp;D,
vitamin&nbsp;K, chromium, cobalt,
iodine, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, tin, calcium,
phosphorus, magnesium, iron, iodine, chromium, tin, and
potassium. Suggested levels for these nutrients would not be
expected to be associated with any adverse effects. Nevertheless,
the EVM acknowledged that for
 those nutrients for which the data&shy;base was inade&shy;quate to establish a&nbsp;UL,
the suggested levels may not be
applicable to all life stages or for lifelong intake, and should not
be used as a&nbsp;UL.

<h3>8a.4.4    U.K. Additional Levels </h3>

<b>Lower Reference Nutrient Intakes (LRNIs)</b> were set by 

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="COMA (Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy). (1991). Dietary reference values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom. Report of the panel on Dietary Reference Values. Report on Health and Social sub&shy;jects No.41. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London. ">

target="right" >COMA,1991</a></span> 

at two standard deviations below the AR for each nutrient. The LRNIs
represent the lowest intakes that will meet the needs of some
indi&shy;viduals in the group.  The LRNIs are used as a&nbsp;monitoring
tool for the UK National Diet and
Nutrition Surveys. Habitual intakes below the LNRI are
almost certainly inade&shy;quate for most indi&shy;viduals. For
confirmation, however, biological parameters should be
measured, especially when the nutrient intake of the indi&shy;vidual
lies between the LRNI and the EAR.
<p></p>
<b>Safe Intake </b> values were also set for some nutrients
with important functions in humans, but for
which the expert committee considered there were insufficient
data to set DRVs (e.g., biotin, pantothenic acid, vitamin&nbsp;E,
vitamin&nbsp;K, manganese, molybdenum, and chromium).
Safe Intake was judged to be a&nbsp;level or 
range of intake at which there is no risk of
deficiency and below a&nbsp;level where there is a&nbsp;risk of undesirable
effects

<h3>8a.4.5. U.K. Average Requirement for Energy</h3>

In view of the increasing risk of overweight and obesity in the U.K.,
the SACN (2012) adopted a&nbsp;prescriptive approach and identified energy 
require&shy;ment values in relation to the best estimates of healthy body weights.
Using this prescriptive
approach, an overweight group consuming the amount of energy
recom&shy;mended for a&nbsp;healthy weight group are likely to lose weight
whereas those under&shy;weight should gain weight 

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content=" SACN Dietary Reference Values for Energy

(<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sacn-dietary-reference-values-for-energy"
target="right" >SACN, 2011</a>).</span>

<p></p>
The U.K average require&shy;ments for energy for adults of specified age, sex, and 
height assuming a&nbsp;median physical activity level (PAL) of 1.63  and 
expressed as MJ/d or kcal/d are available as tables in

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content=" SACN Dietary Reference Values for Energy

(<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sacn-dietary-reference-values-for-energy"
target="right" >SACN, 2011</a>).</span>

Values given in the tables are derived from 
mean heights in 2009 for England (Health 
Survey for England 2009). These revised values apply to all adults unless 
energy expenditure is impaired, when a&nbsp;lower PAL value of 1.49 should be 
used. For children aged 1-18y, age and sex specific energy require&shy;ments, with 
PAL values ranging from 1.40 to 1.75, are presented, expressed as MJ/d or 
kcal/d. Separate tables for infants by age and sex
who are breast-fed, fed breast-milk sub&shy;stitutes, mixed-feeding or unknown by 
age and sex are given, expressed as both MJ/kg or kcal/kg per&nbsp;day and MJ/d or 
kcal/day.  The energy require&shy;ments for infants were adopted from  
FAO/&shy;WHO/&shy;/UNU

target="right" >2004</a>).</span>
<p></p>
The new U.K. factorial approach to establish energy require&shy;ments is based on the assumption that total energy expenditure (TEE) (or EAR) is equal to BMR &times; PAL

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content=" SACN Dietary Reference Values for Energy

(<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sacn-dietary-reference-values-for-energy"
target="right" >SACN, 2011</a>).</span>

This approach was developed in recognition of the 
large unpredictable variation between indi&shy;viduals (inter-indi&shy;vidual variation) in 
discretionary activity. This large inter-indi&shy;vidual variation in 
discretionary activities is attributed in part to spontaneous physical activity 
(SPA). SPA includes body movements associated with activities of daily living, 
changes in posture, fidgeting, and a&nbsp;propensity for locomotion. An 
additional issue recognized by SACN

(<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sacn-dietary-reference-values-for-energy"

 is that PAL values, previously 
assumed to be independent of body weight, appear to have a&nbsp;complex 
relationship with body weight

Conventionally, TEE is expressed as a&nbsp;multiple of Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and (PAL). Therefore:

\[\small \mbox{TEE &equals; PAL &times; BMR}\]

Hence

\[\small \mbox{PAL &equals; TEE / BMR}\]

In this new approach, the PAL values were derived directly from DLW measurements 
of  TEE in a&nbsp;reference 
pop&shy;ula&shy;tion instead of applying PAL values predicted from 
lifestyle information, as used earlier by COMA in 1991 and 1994.
Hence, to extract PAL values, 
TEE values measured by DLW in a&nbsp;suitable adult 
reference pop&shy;ula&shy;tion were divided by BMR
calculated from prediction equations 
of Henry

From the data on the distribution of PAL values in the adult reference 
pop&shy;ula&shy;tion, PAL values for the 25th, 
median, and 75th percentiles corresponding to 
sedentary, low, and moderate activity were identified: i.e., 1.49; 1.63, and 1.78, 
respectively.

PAL values for children aged 
<span class="n">1&ndash;3y,</span> 3 to

To account for the cost of energy

PAL values were adjusted by

 <h2>8a.5 United States and Canada: Dietary Reference Intakes</h2>

The United States and Canada have also adopted a&nbsp;paradigm for
nutrient reference values that incorporates data to optimize health,
prevent risk of chronic disease, and avoid deficiency. Their
approach also provides multiple reference intakes for each nutrient
to meet an expanding list of uses. Specifically, the U.S. Food
and Nutrition Board has expanded their definition of
require&shy;ments to:
<ul class="padded">
<li>Consider reduction in the risk of chronic degenerative
disease, where possible
<li>Establish an upper level of intake designed to avoid risk
of adverse health effects, where data exist
<li>Include components of food not conven&shy;tionally
considered to be essential nutrients (eg choline,
carotenoids, lycopenes, boron, vanadium) but which may
have a&nbsp;possible benefit to health.
</ul>
<p></p>
The nutrient reference values were established by a&nbsp;joint
committee of both Canadian and U.S. scientists set up by the U.S.
Food and Nutrition Board.
The Committee adopted the generic term &ldquo;Dietary Reference
Intakes&rdquo; (DRIs) for a&nbsp;set of reference values for each life-stage 
and sex group.

<p></p>
The criterion chosen by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board to
define nutrient ade&shy;quacy differs for each nutrient and, sometimes,
within the life-stage groups for the same nutrient;
details are given in the separate reports published by
the Food and Nutrition Board

If the variation in require&shy;ment is well
defined and symmetrically distributed, then the RDA is set at two
standard deviations above the EAR: intakes 
at this level have a&nbsp;prob&shy;ability of 
ade&shy;quacy &#8776;&nbsp;98&#37;

\[\small \mbox{RDA} _{98} \mbox{ = EAR &plus; (2 SD)}\]

If a&nbsp;coefficient of variation (CV) for the EAR of 10&#37; is assumed, and as CV=SD/EAR, then
.
\[\small \mbox{RDA} _{98} \mbox{ = EAR &plus; (0.1 &times; EAR) &plus; (0.1 &times; EAR)}\]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or:

When the DRIs were first derived, a&nbsp;CV of 12.5&#37; for protein, 15&#37;
for copper, molybdenum, and niacin, and 20&#37; for both vitamin&nbsp;A
and iodine was applied

No RDA was proposed when there was not enough data to establish an

RDA<sub>98</sub>  is, by definition, associated with a&nbsp;very low 
<span class="n">(2&ndash;3&#37;)</span>  risk
of inade&shy;quacy to an indi&shy;vidual, the RDA<sub>98</sub> is used as a
recom&shy;mended intake when assessing intakes and planning diets for indi&shy;viduals.

<h3>8a.5.3    U.S. and Canada: Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for nutrients </h3>

The Tolerable Upper Intake level (UL) for nutrients is the highest usual daily
nutrient intake level likely to pose no risk of adverse health
effects for almost all indi&shy;viduals in a&nbsp;life-stage and sex group.
ULs have not been set for some nutrients with limited scientific data.
Details of the adverse health effects used to set the ULs are given
in the IOM reports

<p></p>
For some nutrients such  as vitamin&nbsp;C, vitamin&nbsp;A,
vitamin&nbsp;D, calcium,
phosphorus, magnesium, copper, zinc, iron, selenium, iodine, and
manganese, the UL refers to the <u>total</u> intake from all sources,
including food, fortified food, water, supplements, and
medications, where relevant. For others such as niacin and folate,
the UL applies to forms from supplements, fortificants, and
medications.  The UL for magnesium represents intake from
pharmacological agents only and does not include intake from
food and water. In some cases, the form of the nutrient for the UL
differs from that used for the RDA; examples include vitamin&nbsp;E,
niacin, and folate.
<p></p>
The UL should be used by health professionals to ensure that
nutrient intakes are not too high. As intake increases above the
UL, the risk of adverse health effects increases. The UL is based
on risk-assessment methodologies similar to those used in
toxico&shy;log&shy;ical studies

<h3>8a.5.4.  U.S.  and Canada Additional Levels</h3>

 <b>Ade&shy;quate Intake (AI)</b>  was also defined by the IOM and
 refers to a&nbsp;recom&shy;mended average daily
nutrient intake level based on observed or experimentally derived
approximations or estimates of the nutrient intake by a&nbsp;group (or
groups) of appar&shy;ently healthy people.  As noted earlier, for infants
aged 
<span class="n">0&ndash;6mo,</span> the AI represents the nutrient intake values (except
vitamin&nbsp;D) supplied by human milk

The observed or derived intakes are assumed to be ade&shy;quate. The AI
is used when there are not enough scientific data to establish an
AR (e.g., for fluoride, chromium, manganese, total fiber, and
vitamins  pantothenate, choline, and biotin), and is used as an intake
goal for indi&shy;viduals. 
If the an indi&shy;vidual's usual intake equals or exceeds the AI, their intake is 
almost certainly adequate, but if it falls below the AI, no estimate of the 
prob&shy;ability of nutrient adequacy can be made

The EER is defined as the
average energy intake required to maintain current body weight
and physical activity level (PAL) (and to allow for growth or
milk production, where relevant) in healthy, normal-weight
indi&shy;viduals of a&nbsp;specified age, gender, height, weight, and PAL.
Tables provide values as well as equations based on height, weight,
 sex, age, and level of activity to predict TEE.
 <p></p>
The EER values were based on DLW measurements of energy
expenditure, and where relevant, the energy content of the tissue
constituents (basically fat and protein) laid down in growing infants and children.
When body weight and composition is stable in normal-weight indi&shy;viduals, the
energy require&shy;ment is equal to total energy expenditure.
<p></p>
Several regression equations were developed for estimating the
energy require&shy;ments of different life-stage and gender groups.
Separate equations for indi&shy;viduals with a&nbsp;normal body weight (ie
BMI 
<span class="n">18.5&ndash;24.9kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and those overweight or obese
 <span class="n">(BMI &gt;&nbsp;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> were developed.
An example for the equation for normal-weight men aged 19y and above is given below:

\[\small\mbox{EER&nbsp;&equals;&nbsp;661.8&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp; (9.53&nbsp;&times;&nbsp; Age [years])&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;PA&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;(15.91&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Weight [kg]&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;539.6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Height [m])}\]

<b>Lower Threshold Intake (LTI)</b> is one of  two additional levels defined 
 by the EFSA (2017) panel.   The LTI is the intake below
which almost all indi&shy;viduals in the pop&shy;ula&shy;tion will be unable to
maintain metabolic integrity according to the criterion chosen for
each nutrient. The LTI represents the mean &minus;&nbsp;2SD.

<b>Ade&shy;quate Intake (AI)</b> represents a&nbsp;value estimated when a

<h3>8a.6.5.   European Average Requirement for Energy</h3>

The  average require&shy;ments (ARs) for energy expressed as MJ/d for
pop&shy;ula&shy;tion groups within Europe are presented for specified age groups,
and by gender for selected physical activity levels (PALs), depending on age
(<a href="#table8a.7">Table&nbsp;8a.7</a>);
they are of limited use for indi&shy;viduals.
ESFA also chose total energy expenditure (TEE) as the criterion on which to base 
the AR for energy for both adults and children. However, they determined TEE 
factorially from estimates of resting energy expenditure (REE), plus the energy 
needed for various levels of physical activity (PAL) associated with sustainable 
lifestyles in healthy indi&shy;viduals. The equation is shown below:

\[\small\mbox{TEE&nbsp;&equals;&nbsp;PAL&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;REE}\]

where PAL is a&nbsp;given physical activity level, and REE is resting energy expenditure.

The Reference Intake Ranges are defined as the intake range for macro&shy;nutrients,
expressed as a&nbsp;percentage of the energy intake
and are intended as population averages. They apply to
ranges of intakes that are ade&shy;quate for maintaining health and
associated with a&nbsp;low risk of selected chronic diseases.

 Note for saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and trans-fatty acids (TFAs),
an intake as low as possible is advised, whereas for dietary fiber

No reference intake ranges are given for protein,
n-6&nbsp;poly&shy;un&shy;saturated fatty acids (PUFAs) or n-3 PUFAs, unlike WHO (see
Section&nbsp;8a.7.6).

Likewise, no recom&shy;men&shy;dation to restrict daily

<li>Estimated Average Requirement
<li>Recom&shy;mended Nutrient Intake
<li>Tolerable Upper Nutrient Intake Level
</ul></div>

<h3> 8a.7.1  WHO/FAO Requirement (R&nbsp;&equals;&nbsp;AR) for Nutrients </h3>

The require&shy;ment is defined by WHO/FAO as an
average daily nutrient intake level that meets the needs of 50&#37; of
the &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; indi&shy;viduals of a&nbsp;particular age and gender.
It is based on a&nbsp;given criteria of ade&shy;quacy which varies depending
on the specified nutrient. Where necessary, an allowance for
variations in nutrient bio&shy;avail&shy;ability has been included. However,
a require&shy;ment has been set by WHO/FAO for only a&nbsp;few nutrients.
In the interim, Allen et al.

range of vitamins and minerals for infants, children and adults.  
The conversion factors used were based on SDs derived by the U.S. Food and 
Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (FNB/IOM) for calculating the U.S and 
Canadian RDAs. They are tabulated in Annex&nbsp;C of Allen et al.

<h3>8a.7.2   WHO/FAO Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI&nbsp;&equals;&nbsp;RI))</h3> 
The Recommended Nutrient intake  require&shy;ment is defined as a&nbsp;daily
nutrient intake set at the require&shy;ment (AR) plus 2SD.  This meets the nutrient
require&shy;ments of almost all appar&shy;ently healthy indi&shy;viduals in an
age and sex-specific pop&shy;ula&shy;tion group. Thus, it is equivalent to,
and derived in the same way as  indi&shy;vidual require&shy;ments set by COMA

<h3>8a.7.3    WHO/FAO Upper Tolerable Intake Level (UL) of Nutrients </h3>

The WHO/FAO Upper Tolerable Nutrient Intake Levels are defined for a&nbsp;limited range of nutrients as the maximum intake from food
(including fortified products), water and supplements of that
nutrient that is unlikely to pose risk of adverse health effects from
excess in almost all (97.5&#37;) appar&shy;ently healthy indi&shy;viduals in an
age and sex-specific pop&shy;ula&shy;tion group. The ULs were developed
using the model outlined in

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="WHO/FAO (World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization). (2006).  A&nbsp;model for establishing upper levels of intake for nutrients and related sub&shy;stances. Report of Joint FAO/WHO Technical Workshop on Nutrient Risk Assessment. Geneva: WHO/FAO. ">

target="right" >WHO/FAO, 2006</a>).</span>
<p></p>
In October, 2017, the WHO held a technical consultation entitled: &ldquo;Risk of 
excessive intake of vitamins and minerals delivered through public health 
interventions &mdash; current practices and case studies&rdquo;. The proceedings 
of this technical consultation are available in a special issue. The reader is 
advised to consult the following for further details:

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Pike, V., & Zlotkin, S. (2019). Excess micronutrient intake: defining toxic effects and upper limits in vulnerable populations. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1446(1), 21â€“43. ">

WHO/FAO <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2004). Vitamin and mineral require&shy;ments in human nutrition, 2nd ed. World Health Organization">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241546123"
target="right" >2004</a>) </span>

adopted additional terms for certain nutrients.
For vitamin&nbsp;A, for example, they adopted the
term &ldquo;Recom&shy;mended Safe Intake,&rdquo; as was used in their earlier report

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations & World Health Organization (1988).

(<a href="https://www.google.com/"
target="right" >FAO / WHO, 1988</a>),</span>

because of the lack of data for deriving a&nbsp;true
mean require&shy;ment and variance for any group. The Recom&shy;mended Safe Intake
level is set to prevent clinical signs of deficiency and allow
normal growth, but it does not allow for prolonged periods of
infection or other stresses. As such, it represents the normative
storage require&shy;ment plus 2SDs.

 <h3>8a.7.5   WHO/FAO Human Energy Requirements</h3>

Energy require&shy;ments set by FAO/WHO

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2004). Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition, 2nd ed. World Health Organization">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241546123"
target="right" >2004</a>) </span>

are presented by
gender and selected age groups and are expressed as energy (as kJ or kcal)
per day and energy per&nbsp;kilogram of body weight. Requirements are also
expressed as multiples of Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).  
The recom&shy;men&shy;dations for dietary
energy intake are also accompanied by guidelines for desirable physical
activity levels: see FAO/WHO

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2004). Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition, 2nd ed. World Health Organization">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241546123"
target="right" >2004</a>) </span>

for more details.
<p></p>
Note that, like the U.K and EFSA, the FAO/WHO
energy require&shy;ments are specifically &ldquo;prescriptive&rdquo; in relation to body
weights, defining suitable reference ranges consistent
with long-term good health, amd should be applied to pop&shy;ula&shy;tion groups
and not to indi&shy;viduals.
<p></p>
The FAO/WHO

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2004). Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition, 2nd ed. World Health Organization">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9241546123"

energy require&shy;ments are based on 
estimates of TEE in free-living persons measured by 
DLW or other methods (e.g.,
indi&shy;vidually calibrated heart rate monitoring) that give comparable results.
They also modified their earlier factorial estimates
of energy require&shy;ments which used occupational-related mean values
of physical activity levels (PALs).  Instead FAO/WHO

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2004). Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition, 2nd ed. World Health Organization">

The PAL values were calculated from the measurement of TEE
and measurements or estimates of BMR (i.e., PAL = TEE/BMR).
Both men and women are assigned to a&nbsp;PAL category
using th same PAL values.
The estimates of BMR were derived from the age and sex-specific
predictive equations of Schofield (1985) using body weight alone.
<p></p>
The additional energy needs for pregnancy and lactation were also
calculated using factorial estimates for the growth of maternal and
fetal tissues, the metabolic changes associated with pregnancy,
and the synthesis and secretion of milk during lactation.
<p></p>
For infants 
<span class="n">1&ndash;12mos,</span> the energy require&shy;ments
were estimated from equations for TEE, adding the energy needs
for growth. Separate energy require&shy;ments (as kJ/kg/d)
are available for breastfed and formula fed infants with the
same body weight up to 12mos of age because  TEE is
lower among breastfed than formula-fed infants during the first year of life.
<p></p>
For children  and adolescents, measurements of TEE were derived using both 
DLW and heart rate monitoring, from which predictive 
quadratic polynomial regression
equations for boys and girls were derived; equations are available in 
FAO/WHO

The sum of TEE and the additional energy 
deposited in growing tissue and
laid down during normal growth, represents the mean daily energy requirement 
(kcal or MJ/day). For more details, see FAO/WHO

<h3>8a.7.6  WHO/FAO Pop&shy;ula&shy;tion Average Intake 
Goals for Macronutrients</h3>

The WHO ranges of pop&shy;ula&shy;tion nutrient intake goals for preventing
diet-related chronic diseases are shown
in <a href="#table8a.3">Table&nbsp;8a.3</a>. The recom&shy;men&shy;dations are expressed as a
proportion of the daily total energy intake rather than the absolute
amount, with the exception of cholesterol and sodium, which are
given in mg/d and g/d, respectively. This approach was adopted
because the desirable up or down change will depend on the
existing intakes in a&nbsp;given pop&shy;ula&shy;tion

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Nishida, C., Uauy, R., Kumanyika, S., & Shetty, P. (2004). The joint WHO/FAO expert consultation on diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases: process, product and policy implications. Public health nutrition, 7(1A), 245â€“250.">

The recom&shy;men&shy;dations represent the pop&shy;ula&shy;tion average intake that is
judged to be consistent with the maintenance of health (i.e., low
prevalence of diet-related diseases) in a&nbsp;pop&shy;ula&shy;tion

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine. (2002) Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids.   The National Academic Press, Washington, DC">

Hence these focus on the maintenance of low <i>pop&shy;ula&shy;tion risk</i> rather than low indi&shy;vidual risk.  In general, most of the ranges set are comparable
to those of the U.K and the U.S. and Canada, although the
meaning and application of the ranges differ.
Exceptions are the recom&shy;men&shy;dations by WHO/FAO for total fat intake which take 
into account countries
with usual fat intake (as &#37; energy) &gt;&nbsp;30&#37;
and &lt;&nbsp;15&#37;. Total fat
(as &#37; energy) of at least 20&#37; is consistent with good health.
<p></p>
 The recom&shy;men&shy;dation to restrict the intake of free sugars to less than
10&#37; energy was made  in view of the recognition that higher
intakes of free sugars provide significant energy without
supplying specific nutrients, and hence can have a&nbsp;negative
impact on diet quality. In addition, increasing or decreasing intake
of free sugars is associated with parallel changes in body weight,
a relationship that exists irrespective of the level of the intake of free sugars.
The excess body weight associated with intake of free sugars
arises from excess energy intake. Free sugars include
monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages
by the manufacturer, cook, or consumer, and sugars naturally
present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice
concentrations.
<p></p>
WHO emphasize that whole grain cereals, fruits and vegetables
are the preferred sources of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP)
(See <a href="#table8a.3">Table&nbsp;8a.3</a>).  They state that
whole grain foods should together provide &gt;&nbsp;20g per&nbsp;day of NSP
and &gt;&nbsp;25g/d of total dietary fiber. Note that fruits and vegetables
do not include tubers (i.e., potatoes, cassava).
<p></p>
In addition to the pop&shy;ula&shy;tion nutrient intake goals 
presented in <a href="#table8a.3">Table&nbsp;8a.3</a>,
WHO also emphasize the importance of maintaining at the
pop&shy;ula&shy;tion level an adult median BMI of 
<span class="n">21&ndash;23kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> and for
indi&shy;viduals a&nbsp;BMI in the range 
<span class="n">18.5&ndash;24.9kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> with the
avoidance of a&nbsp;weight gain greater than 5kg during adult life.
Physical activity is also highlighted with a&nbsp;recom&shy;men&shy;dation for a
total of one hour per day on most days of the week of moderate-
intensity activity , such as walking.

compares the ARs for selected
micronutrients set by the IOM in the U.S., by EFSA in Europe, and
by COMA in the UK.
Some of the discrepancies seen in Table&nbsp;8a.11 arise because of differences in judgment by
the expert groups setting the requirement estimates even when
the same evidence-base has been consulted.
Other potential sources of discrepancies in the AR and thus RI<sub>98</sub> include:
<ul class="padded">
<li>
Disparities in philosophy about the most appropriate
method&shy;ological approach to use
</li><li>Interpretation of data on which ARs are based
</li><li>Differences in selection of the criteria used to define
nutrient ade&shy;quacy
</li><li>Uncertainty in extent of metabolic adaption during
pregnancy and lactation due to limited data
</li><li>Differences in number of life-stage groupings among
countries
</li><li>Limited data on require&shy;ments for certain nutrients and
life-stage groups
</li><li>Differences in scaling (both interpolation and
extrapolation) for sub&shy;groups based on known data for
other pop&shy;ula&shy;tions (e.g., adults)
</li><li>Varying bio&shy;avail&shy;ability factors depending on the
composition of habitual national diets
</li><li>Unknown factors influencing nutrient require&shy;ments.
</li></ul>
<p></p>
Such discrepancies may be especially large for those nutrients
and specific age groups for which the available data on
require&shy;ments are very limited (e.g., children, adolescents, and the
elderly). In such cases, require&shy;ments are often interpolated or
extrapolated from data for other age groups, or they are not
compiled at all. In addition, during pregnancy and lactation,
maternal metabolic adaptation for certain nutrients may occur,
but because the adaptation has not been firmly characterized, the
additional nutrient needs are still equivocal.
<p></p>
A further source of discrepancy arises from the adjustments required
that take into account the bio&shy;avail&shy;ability of nutrients in the habitual
national diet. The adjustments required depend
on the nature of the diet
ingested, the chemical form of the nutrient in the diet, and a
variety of systemic factors known to affect the absorption and
utilization of the nutrient.  For many nutrients, factors affecting
their bio&shy;avail&shy;ability have yet to be established, so appropriate
adjustments to yield dietary require&shy;ment estimates cannot be
made. For others, fixed bio&shy;avail&shy;ability factors are applied, even
though the efficiency of absorption may vary with the dietary
level of the nutrient or the life-stage group. For example, in U.K.
diets, iron is assumed to have a&nbsp;fixed bio&shy;avail&shy;ability of 15&#37;,
irrespective of the age and life-stage group

to adjust for bio&shy;avail&shy;ability, depending on the composition of the
diet.
<p></p>
Several other factors besides sex, life-stage, and the habitual diet, are known
to influence the require&shy;ments for many nutrients.  Examples
include body size, lean body mass, and activity level. For this
reason, the require&shy;ment estimates are often set 
using a&nbsp;&ldquo;standard&rdquo;
height and weight, and/or energy intake for a&nbsp;particular age and
life-stage group; standards that may vary across countries. Therefore, those nutrients
with require&shy;ments expressed per&nbsp;kg body weight or per&nbsp;MJ, may
also differ. For example, reference heights and body weights used
by EFSA

In the future, factors such as race or ethnicity, lifestyle (e.g.,

into account when setting require&shy;ment estimates

Finally, knowledge of the SD associated with the AR is required
to set the RI<sub>98</sub>. In many cases, however, the SD is calculated
from the AR and an assumed CV, because the SD is unknown.
Although a&nbsp;CV of 10&#37; or 15&#37; is often assumed, this is not
always the case.  WHO/FAO

<h2>8a.9 Future directions in harmonizing the process for deriving Nutrient Reference Values</h2>

Nutrient Reference Values are used to assess the ade&shy;quacy of nutrient 
intakes and for planning diets at both the indi&shy;vidual and the pop&shy;ula&shy;
tion level.  They also have several important applications in food and nutrition 
policy, food regulation and trade. However, as highlighted above, the 
terminology and method&shy;ological approaches that are used for setting NRVs 
differ markedly among countries resulting in discrepancies in NRVs worldwide.  
Such disparate recom&shy;men&shy;dations lead to international discrepancies in health, 
food policies and trade,  highlighting important reasons for harmonizing the 
process for deriving NRVs globally; these reasons 
are summarized in Box&nbsp;8a.8.
<div class="box">
<b>Box 8a.8  Reasons for harmonizing the process of deriving NRVs globally</b>
<ul>
<li>	Improve objectivity and transparency of values derived by different national, regional, and international groups
<li>Provide a&nbsp;common basis or background for groups of experts to consider the processes leading to the development of the Nutrient Intake Values (NIVs)
<li>Allow for low-income countries with limited resources to convene groups  of experts to identify how to modify existing reference values to meet the specific food supplies or international policies
<li>Provide a&nbsp;common basis across countries and regions for establishing global food and nutrition policies (i.e., fortification policies, regulatory issues)
</li></ul>
From King and Garza (2007) and NASEM (2018b).
</div>
<p></p>
Recently, the feasibility of the new harmonized approach for deriving Nutrient 
Reference Values on a&nbsp;global scale has been confirmed following testing 
with three exemplar nutrients (zinc, iron, and folate) on two high-risk pop&shy;ula&shy;tion 
sub&shy;groups&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;young children 
and women of reproductive age, as noted in Section&nbsp;8.2. The success of 
the new framework depicted in <a href="#figure8a.3">Figure&nbsp;8a.3</a>, 
however, depends on six core values:
<ul class="padded">
<li>NRVs are regularly updated
<li>The process is clear and transparent
<li>The methods are rigorous and relevant
<li>Factors influencing the NRVs are documented
<li>The strength of the evidence is determined
<li>The review is complete and efficient.
</li></ul>
<p></p>
Several barriers have been identified that must be overcome before the proposed 
new organizing framework can be implemented globally.
In addition, as highlighted earlier, many gaps in the 
scientific information required 
to compile NRVs still remain. This results in sources of uncertainty that must be 
considered, acknowledged and managed appropriately when deriving the NRVs.
