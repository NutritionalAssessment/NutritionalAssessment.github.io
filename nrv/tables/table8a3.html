Table 8a.3  UK dietary reference values (DRVs) and the WHO ranges of population nutrient intake goals (2003) for the energy supplying macronutrients for the prevention of diet-related chronic diseases.
<br/>Figures are for percentage of total energy, unless otherwise stated. 
The U.S. and Canadian Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDRs) 
intended for individual adults are shown for comparison.
<br/>
<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Recommendations apply 
to adults and children over 5 y of age, unless otherwise stated. 
<br/><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Represent the 
population average intake that is judged to be consistent with the maintenance of 
health in a population.
<br/><sup>a</sup>&nbsp;Total fat includes all saturated and unsaturated fat (mono-and polyunsaturated)
<br/><sup>b</sup>&nbsp;Saturated fat – several studies have shown a high saturated fat intake to be linked with high blood cholesterol. Elevated blood cholesterol is a risk factor for coronary heart disease
Studies have shown that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat in the diet reduces blood cholesterol and lowers the risk of heart disease and stroke
<br/><sup>c</sup>&nbsp;This is calculated as total fat−(saturated fatty acids + unsaturated fatty acids + trans fatty acids)
<br/><sup>d</sup>&nbsp;Total carbohydrate includes all starch, sugars and dietary fiber
<br/><sup>e</sup>&nbsp;Free sugars are sugars added to foods and drinks by the manufacturer, cook, or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juice
<br/><sup>f</sup>&nbsp;Total fiber is the combination of Dietary Fiber, the edible, nondigestible carbohydrate and lignin components as they exist naturally in plant foods and Functional Fiber, which refers to isolated, or synthetic fiber that has proven health benefits. 
<br/><sup>g</sup>&nbsp;Women should not regularly drink more than 2-3 units of alcohol/day;  Men – should not regularly drink more than 3-4 units of alcohol/day
<br/><sup>h</sup>&nbsp;Target salt intakes set for adults (and children) do not represent ideal or optimum consumption levels, but achievable population goals
<br/>* Based on SACN 2015 recommendations for population aged 2 years and above
<br/>** Based on COMA 1991 recommendations for population aged 5 years and above
