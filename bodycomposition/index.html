Most anthropometric methods used to assess body compo&shy;sition are based
on the two com&shy;ponment model whereby the body consists of
fat and fat-free mass. These two body com&shy;ponents can be
assessed indirectly from selected skin&shy;fold
thick&shy;ness and cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence measure&shy;ments taken by
stan&shy;dard&shy;ized tech&shy;niques.  Several methods exist for
estim&shy;ating per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat and/or
total body fat. In the simplest method,
skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness measure&shy;ments,
either singly or in combination, are used to assess
body fat (as % or total). Alternatively, per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat
can be predicted from adiposity equations matched to
the meas&shy;ured skin&shy;folds and study population (by age,
gender, ethnicity, activity level, etc).  Arm-fat area,
calculated from triceps skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness and mid-upper arm cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence (MUAC),
is also used as a proxy for total body fat,
although the equation used has some limitations.
Both WHO international and population-specific
refer&shy;ence data are avail&shy;able for triceps and subscap&shy;ular
skin&shy;folds for children. Arm-fat area data are more limited,
although data for U.S. children (1-20y) from the
CDC2000 BMI growth chart sample have been compiled.
<p></p>
Anthropometric variables from multiple anatomical sites are
also used to estimate body density, from which the
per&shy;cent&shy;age of body fat, and subsequently,
total body fat is calculated.  The reliability of
this method has been questioned based on
comparisons of the derived per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat
esti&shy;mates against those generated using the
<i>in vivo</i> gold standard 4-com&shy;ponent model which does
not rely on any theoret&shy;ical assumptions.
Corrections that account for age, sex, disease
state or nutritional status can now be applied to
the density-based formulae and/or the
empirical equations used to relate fat content
to body density, and thus improve
the final assessment of body compo&shy;sition.
<p></p>
Recognition of the link between the distri&shy;bution of
body fat and risk of cardiovascular disease has
prompted use of waist-hip ratio (WHR), and more recently,
waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence (WC), as practical anthropometric
surrogates for intra-abdominal visceral fat. Population-specific
cutoffs for adults have been set to denote high WHR or WC
indicative of abdominal obesity and cardiovascular risk.
Increasingly, WC is being included along with
BMI in all obesity surveillance studies.
<p></p>
Fat-free mass can be estim&shy;ated as body weight (kg) minus
body fat from the adiposity or density-based methods
outlined above. Alternatively, simpler methods
include the measure&shy;ment of MUAC, either alone or
combined with triceps skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness to
calculate arm mid-upper-muscle cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence (MUAMC) or arm
muscle area (AMA). MUAC alone is used in
emergencies to screen for severe acute malnutrition (SAM),
whereas MUAMC and AMA can be used as proxies for
muscle mass, and thus for the detection of
sarco&shy;penia in the elderly. AMA is preferable to
MUAMC because it more adequately reflects the
true magnitude of tissue changes.
<p></p>
Calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence and hand grip strength as
surrogate markers of skel&shy;etal muscle mass and
strength respectively, are increasingly being used,
in part because loss of both muscle mass and
strength has been associ&shy;ated with several adverse
health outcomes. Both measure&shy;ments are
recommended by the Asian and European Working
Groups on Sarcopenia to identify at risk older adults.
The measure&shy;ments are also used in children and athletes to
assess physical fitness. Adiposity has been identified
as a confounder of calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence measure&shy;ments,
and BMI adjust&shy;ment factors have been developed.
Low calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence with any BMI can now be identified.
Population-specific calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence cutoff values are avail&shy;able to
detect low muscle mass in adults.  Handgrip strength is
said to be a better predictor of functional health
outcomes than low muscle mass, and has been linked with
alteration in physical performance in cross-sectional studies.
Associations with all-cause mortal&shy;ity, cardiovascular
mortal&shy;ity, and hospital readmissions have
also been observed in prospective cohort studies.
Hand grip strength is meas&shy;ured with a
calibrated handheld dynamometer. The measure&shy;ments depend on the
model used, but dynamometer-specific cutoffs values are
not yet applied. Current cutoffs for weak muscle strength
vary across regions; population specific normative
refer&shy;ence data are avail&shy;able for the elderly and across the life course.
<p></p>
Finally, the cross-sectional nature of the normative refer&shy;ence data compiled for
the anthropometric variables discussed limits their use for monitoring the
trajectories of individuals and the degree to which causal and age-related
inferences can be drawn.  None of the anthropometric
variables are sensitive enough
to monitor small changes in body fat or fat-free mass that may arise after
short-term nutritional support or deprivation.

<h2> 11.0 Anthropometric assessment of body compo&shy;sition</h2>

Most anthropometric methods used to assess body compo&shy;sition are
based on a model in which the body consists of two
chemically distinct com&shy;ponents: fat and the fat-free mass,
with the principle that if one of these compo&shy;nents is
deter&shy;mined, the other can be estim&shy;ated. The amount and
distri&shy;bution of both body fat and the fat-free mass have
important health outcomes in infants, children, and
adults.

<p></p>
Fat is the main long-term storage form of
energy in the body, and alterations in body fat content
provide indirect esti&shy;mates of changes in energy balance.
Most of the body fat is stored in adipose tissue, which is
distrib&shy;uted in dif&shy;ferent
pro&shy;port&shy;ions through&shy;out the body.
The pattern of distri&shy;bution of adipose tissue is dependent
on many factors including sex, age, race/eth&shy;nicity,
geno&shy;type, diet, physical activity, and hormone levels.
Adipose tissue is tradition&shy;ally distrib&shy;uted into two main
compo&shy;nents, each with dif&shy;fer&shy;ent meta&shy;bolic charact&shy;er&shy;istics:
sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose
tissue (VAT).  Of the two compo&shy;nents, visceral adipose
tissue is a hormon&shy;ally active compo&shy;nent of total body fat
tissue and an inde&shy;pen&shy;dent risk marker of cardio&shy;vascular and
meta&shy;bolic morbid&shy;ity and mortal&shy;ity.  Abnorm&shy;ally high
deposition of VAT is known as visceral
obesity

<p></p>
Fat may also be present
in areas of the body where fat is not physio&shy;logic&shy;ally
stored, such as liver, pancreas, heart, and skel&shy;etal muscle.
Fat sur&shy;rounding these organs is termed ectopic fat, and its
depos&shy;ition might contribute to increased risk of
athero&shy;scler&shy;osis and type&nbsp;2 diabetes

The fat-free mass
consists of the skel&shy;etal muscle, non-skel&shy;etal muscle,
organs, connective tissue, total body water,
and the skel&shy;eton.  Muscle is a
major compo&shy;nent of the fat-free mass and the primary site
for glucose uptake and storage, as well as a reservoir of
amino acids stored as protein.  Loss of muscle mass is
associ&shy;ated with several negative health outcomes, including
delayed recovery from illness, slowed wound healing, reduced
meta&shy;bolic rate, and physical dis&shy;ability

The anthropometric measure&shy;ments of body compo&shy;sition are fast,
non&shy;invasive, and require the minimum of equip&shy;ment com&shy;pared
to labor&shy;atory tech&shy;niques.  Consequently, anthro&shy;pometry has
been the method most frequ&shy;ently used in the past in both
routine clinical and public health settings.  Increas&shy;ingly,
however, recognition of the limit&shy;ations of anthro&shy;pometry to
assess body compo&shy;sition has led to the use of alter&shy;native
laboratory methods to assess body compo&shy;sition such as
bio&shy;elec&shy;trical imped&shy;ance analysis (BIA) and dual energy X-ray
absorp&shy;tiometry (DXA) in these settings

See Chapter&nbsp;14 for details of these laboratory methods.

<p></p>
In clinical practice, indices of
body compo&shy;sition can be used to identify patients with
chronic under&#8209; or over&shy;nutrition and to monitor long-term
changes in body compo&shy;sition during nutrit&shy;ional support.  In
public health, they can identify individ&shy;uals who are
vulner&shy;able to under&#8209; or over&shy;nutrition and help evaluate the
effective&shy;ness of nutrition inter&shy;vention programs.

<p></p>
Details of the stan&shy;dard&shy;ized procedures used for
anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ments of body compo&shy;sition, and the
deriv&shy;ation of the more impor&shy;tant indices and their
limit&shy;ations are sum&shy;marized in this chapter and are given in
detail in Lohman et&nbsp;al.

Variability in body
compo&shy;sition across popul&shy;ations associ&shy;ated with life&shy;style,
environ&shy;ment, genetics, and ethnicity has empha&shy;sized the need
for pop&shy;ulation-specific refer&shy;ence data to interpret body
compo&shy;sition indices

Hence, where appro&shy;priate, the inter&shy;pretive criteria avail&shy;able for the
assessment of body compo&shy;sition based on anthro&shy;pometry, are
also summarized.  For a review of the methods used to
develop refer&shy;ence values and cutoff points, the reader is
advised to consult Chapter&nbsp;1.

<h3> 11.1 Assessment of body fat</h3>

The body fat content is the most variable
compo&shy;nent of the body, differing among indiv&shy;iduals of the
same sex, height, and weight.  Estimates of total body fat,
together with the rate of change in the body fat content,
are often used to assess the presence and severity of
under&shy;nutrition.  A large and rapid loss of body fat is
indic&shy;ative of severe negative energy balance.  Small changes
in body fat (i.e., &lt;&nbsp;0.5kg), however, cannot be meas&shy;ured
accurately using anthro&shy;pometry.

<p></p>
On average, the fat
content of women is higher than that of men, represent&shy;ing
26.9% of their total body weight com&shy;pared with 14.7% for men

Body fat is deposited in two
major types of sites:  one for essential lipids, and the
other for storage of fat.  Essential lipids are found in the
bone marrow, central nervous system, mammary glands, and
other organs and are required for normal physio&shy;logical
function&shy;ing; fat from these sites makes up about 9% (4.9kg)
of body weight in refer&shy;ence woman and 3% (2.1kg) in
refer&shy;ence man.  Storage fat consists of inter&#8209; and
intra-muscular fat, fat surroun&shy;ding the organs (e.g., liver,
heart, pancreas) and gastro&shy;intes&shy;tinal tract, and
sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7239496/"
target="right" >Lohman, 1981</a>)</span>.

The pro&shy;por&shy;tion of storage
fat in males and females is relatively constant, averaging
12% of total body weight in males and 15% in females.
<p></p>
Of the total body fat, over one-third in refer&shy;ence
man and woman is estim&shy;ated to be sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat.  Body fat
is expressed either in absol&shy;ute terms (the weight of total
body fat in kilograms) or as a percen&shy;tage of the total body
weight.  There is, how&shy;ever, a lack of con&shy;sensus about the
useful&shy;ness of percen&shy;tage body fat as an index of adi&shy;posity.
Some inves&shy;tiga&shy;tors argue that percen&shy;tage body fat
over-adjusts for weight because it includes the fat mass
compo&shy;nent in both the numer&shy;ator and denom&shy;in&shy;ator

<span data-tippy-content="Cole, T. J., Fewtrell, M. S., & Prentice, A. (2008). The fallacy of using per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat as a measure of adiposity. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 87(6), 1959–1960.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18541591/"
target="right" >Cole et al., 2008</a>)</span>.

A further limit&shy;ation is that percen&shy;tage fat is
not fully inde&shy;pen&shy;dent of body size.  High percen&shy;tage fat
values might reflect high adiposity or low lean mass

<p></p>
In population studies, body fat is often
assessed by anthro&shy;pometry.  In the past, body mass index has
been the prin&shy;cipal index used to pre&shy;dict excess adiposity;
see Chapter&nbsp;10 for more details.  How&shy;ever, skin&shy;fold
thick&shy;ness determin&shy;ations, either alone or in assoc&shy;iation
with other anthro&shy;pometric variables (e.g., limb girths and
breadths), are also used to pre&shy;dict percen&shy;tage body fat;
over six hundred pre&shy;dic&shy;tion equations have been devel&shy;oped.
Assoc&shy;iations between these anthro&shy;pometric variables and
percent body fat differ by many factors including gender,
age, race / ethnicity, and level of adi&shy;posity so that
pre&shy;dic&shy;tion equations must be care&shy;fully matched with the
popul&shy;ation under study and stan&shy;dard&shy;ized tech&shy;niques used for
the measure&shy;ments

More recently, the impor&shy;tance of the distrib&shy;ution of body fat has
been empha&shy;sized.  Numerous studies have reported
correl&shy;ations between the amount of intra-abdominal fat
(i.e., visceral adipose tissue) and meta&shy;bolic disturb&shy;ances
linked to the risk of cardio&shy;vascular disease

Waist-hip cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence ratio and,
increasingly, waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence
alone, are being used as anthro&shy;pometric surro&shy;gates for
intra-abdom&shy;inal visceral fat (Sections 11.1.6 and 11.1.7).

<h3> 11.1.1 Skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness measure&shy;ments</h3>

Skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness measure&shy;ments provide an estimate
of the size of the sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat depot, which, in turn,
has been used to derive an estimate of total body adiposity.
Such an estimate is based on seven assump&shy;tions shown in
<a href="#figure11.1">Figure&nbsp;11.1</a>, most of which are not true.

For example, the
relation&shy;ship between sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous and internal fat is
non&shy;linear and varies with body weight and age:  very lean
subjects have a smaller pro&shy;por&shy;tion of body fat deposited
sub&shy;cut&shy;aneously than obese subjects.  More&shy;over, varia&shy;tions in
the distrib&shy;ution of sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat occur with sex, race or
ethnicity, and age

center of the cubital fossa, at the same level as the
triceps skin&shy;fold.

<li>Subscapular skin&shy;fold is meas&shy;ured below
and laterally to the angle of the shoulder blade, with the
shoulder and arm relaxed.  Placing the subject's arm behind
the back may assist in iden&shy;tific&shy;ation of the site.  The

Marked ethnic differences in adiposity based on skin&shy;folds (as well as fat
mass via BIA and DXA) have been reported.  For example,
greater sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat&shy;ness was reported for white boys
com&shy;pared to their black counter&shy;parts in the U.S.

For these BMI charts, the weight data for children &gt;&nbsp;6y who
participated in the NHANES&nbsp;III survey were excluded because the inclusion
of these data shifted the upper percentile curves.

<p></p>
Race-ethnicity differences in skin&shy;folds have also
been reported in children living in the U.K. &nbsp;&nbsp;Adi&shy;posity
levels were higher among South Asian children based on the sum
of four skin&shy;folds (biceps, triceps, subscap&shy;ular and
suprailiac), whereas black African Caribbean children had
similar or lower adi&shy;posity levels than white Euro&shy;peans

Clearly, race-ethnicity differ&shy;ences in fat pat&shy;tern&shy;ing
should be taken into account
when inter&shy;preting results based on sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous skin&shy;folds.

<p></p>
Skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness measure&shy;ments are best
made using precision thick&shy;ness calipers; they measure the
compressed double fold of fat plus skin.  As a result of the
com&shy;pres&shy;sion, they always under&shy;estimate actual sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous
fat thick&shy;ness.  The skin&shy;fold is always grasped at the marked
site with the fingers on top, thumb below, and fore&shy;finger on
the marked site.  Three types of precision calipers can be
used:  Harpenden, Lange, and Holtain
(<a href="#figure11.4">Figure&nbsp;11.4</a>).
<p></p>
<!--<p class="clearleft">-->

Figure&nbsp;11.4. Harpenden (a), Lange (b), and Holtain (c)
precision skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness calipers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p></p>
Precision calipers are designed to exert a
defined and constant pressure throughout the range of
meas&shy;ured skin&shy;folds and to have a standard contact surface
area or &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; area of 20&#8209;40mm<sup>2</sup>.
The skin&shy;fold calipers
must be recalib&shy;rated at regular intervals using a
calibra&shy;tion block.  Both the Harpenden and Holtain skin&shy;fold
calipers, which have a standard jaw pressure of 10g/mm<sup>2</sup>,
give smaller skin&shy;fold values than Lange calipers, which are
fitted with a lighter spring

<span data-tippy-content="Gruber, J. J., Pollock, M. L., Graves, J. E., Colvin, A. B., & Braith, R. W. (1990). Comparison of Harpenden and Lange calipers in predicting body compo&shy;sition. Research quarterly for exercise and sport, 61(2), 184–190.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2094930/"
target="right" >Gruber et al., 1990</a>)</span>.

For example, values from Holtain calipers are about 2&#8209;5mm (mean)
lower than those obtained using the Lange calipers

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6708788/"
target="right" >Lohman et al., 1984</a>)</span>.

Hence, care must be taken to ensure the same
precision calipers are used when examining secular trends in
skin&shy;fold thick&shy;nesses.
<p></p>
For all the skin&shy;fold
measure&shy;ments, the subject should stand erect with the weight
evenly distributed and feet together, shoulders relaxed, and
arms hanging freely at the sides.  The measure&shy;ment tech&shy;nique
is described in detail for the triceps skin&shy;fold, as the
latter is the site most frequently used to obtain a single
indirect measure of body fat; the tech&shy;nique used for the
other skin&shy;fold sites is similar.  There is no con&shy;sen&shy;sus as
to whether the left or right side of the body should be
used.  In the WHO Multicentre Child Growth Reference Study,
triceps and subscap&shy;ular measure&shy;ments were taken on the left
side of the body

<span data-tippy-content="de&nbsp;Onis, M., Onyango, A. W., Van den Broeck, J., Chumlea, W. C., & Martorell, R. (2004).

target="right" >de&nbsp;Onis et al., 2004</a>)</span>.

A description of
these measure&shy;ment protocols are avail&shy;able in the WHO
anthropometric training video.  How&shy;ever, the current
practice of the U.S.&nbsp;National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES) is that skin&shy;fold sites are
meas&shy;ured on the right side of the body.

<h3>Measurement of triceps skin&shy;fold</h3>

The measure&shy;ment of the triceps
skin&shy;fold is performed at the midpoint of the upper right
arm, between the acromion process and the tip of the
olecranon, with the arm hanging relaxed.  To mark the
midpoint, the right arm is bent 90&deg; at the elbow, and the
forearm is placed palm down across the body.  Then the tip
of the acromion process of the shoulder blade at the
outermost edge of the shoulder and the tip of the olecranon
process of the ulna are located and marked.  The distance
between these two points is meas&shy;ured using a non-stretchable
tape, and the midpoint is marked with a soft pen or
indelible pencil, directly in line with the point of the
elbow and acromion process (Figure&nbsp;11.2).  The right arm
is then extended so that it is hanging loosely by the side.
The examiner grasps a vertical fold of skin plus the
underlying fat, 2cm above the marked midpoint, in line with
the tip of the olecranon process, using both the thumb and
forefinger.  The skin&shy;fold is gently pulled away from the
underlying muscle tissue, and then the caliper jaws are
applied at right angles, exactly at the marked midpoint
(<a href="#figure11.5">Figure&nbsp;11.5</a>).
The skin&shy;fold remains held between the fingers
while the measure&shy;ment is taken.

When using the Lange, Harpenden,
or Holtain calipers, pressure must be applied to open the
jaws before the instrument is placed on the skin&shy;fold; the
jaws will then close under spring pressure.  As the jaws
compress the tissue, the caliper reading generally
diminishes for 2&#8209;3s, and then the measure&shy;ments are taken.
Skin&shy;folds should be recorded to 0.1mm on the Harpenden and
Holtain skin&shy;fold calipers and to 0.5mm on the Lange.
<p></p>
Triceps skin&shy;fold measure&shy;ments can also be made with
the subject lying down.  The subject lies on the left side
with legs bent, the head supported by a pillow, and the left
hand tucked under the pillow.  The right arm rests along the
trunk, with the palm down.  The measure&shy;ment is taken at the
marked midpoint of the back of the upper right arm, as
described above.  The examiner should be careful to avoid
parallax errors by bending down to read the calipers while
taking the measure&shy;ments

<h3>Precision of skin&shy;fold measure&shy;ments</h3>

Within-examiner and between-examiner measure&shy;ment errors can
occur when mea&shy;sur&shy;ing skin&shy;folds, particularly for subjects
with flabby, easily compres&shy;sible tissue or with very firm
tissue that is not easily deformed

Errors may also occur when mea&shy;sur&shy;ing skin&shy;folds in obese subjects

target="right" >Forbes et al., 1988</a>)</span>.
<p></p>
Within-examiner errors can
occur when the same examiner fails to obtain identical
results on repeated skin&shy;folds on the same subject; such
errors are a function of the skin&shy;fold site, the experience
of the examiner, and the fatness of the subject.
Within-examiner measure&shy;ment errors can be small when
mea&shy;sur&shy;ing triceps skin&shy;folds, provided that training in
stan&shy;dard&shy;ized procedures is given; the errors in these
circumstances typically range from 0.70&#8209;0.95mm

Between-examiner errors arise when two or more
examiners measure the same subject and skin&shy;fold site; such errors are
usually larger than within-examiner errors, but they can be
reduced to not more than 2mm with training and care

A difference of more than 5mm
between the measure&shy;ments of the criterion anthro&shy;pometrist
and the trainee indicates a gross error related to the
reading or recording; a difference between the measure&shy;ment
of the criterion anthro&shy;pometrist and the trainee of
0.0&#8209;0.9mm indicates that the trainee has reached an
acceptable level of pro&shy;ficiency in the measure&shy;ment
tech&shy;nique.

In the WHO Multi&shy;centre Growth Reference
Study, measure&shy;ments for triceps and subscap&shy;ular skin&shy;folds
were taken on each child by two trained and stan&shy;dard&shy;ized
anthro&shy;pom&shy;etrists.  Their values were then com&shy;pared to ensure
that the duplicate measure&shy;ments were within the maximum
allowable differ&shy;ence, designated as 2.0mm for each skin&shy;fold

countries (Brazil, China, India, Norway, Oman, and the USA)
were included.  To reduce the impact of environ&shy;mental
variation, only privileged healthy popul&shy;ations were selected

<h3> 11.1.2  Assessing body fat with skin&shy;folds</h3>

Skin&shy;fold measure&shy;ments at a single or multiple
sites can be used to estimate total body fat or per&shy;cent&shy;age
body fat.  Calcul&shy;ation of per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat is based on
the assump&shy;tion that fat mass is adjusted for body weight,
even though per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat is not fully inde&shy;pen&shy;dent of
body size

<span data-tippy-content="Wells J. C. (2014). Toward body composition reference data for infants, 
children, and adolescents. Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.), 5(3), 320S–9S.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24829484/"
target="right" >Wells, 2014</a>).</span>

Further&shy;more, high values
for per&shy;cen&shy;tage body fat might reflect either high fat mass
or low fat-free mass, as noted earlier

<span data-tippy-content="Wells J. (2019). Body compo&shy;sition of children with moderate and severe undernutrition and after treatment: a narrative review. BMC medicine, 17(1), 215.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31767002/"
target="right" >Wells, 2019</a>)</span>.

<p></p>
If a single skin&shy;fold measure&shy;ment approach is used, it
is critical to select the skin&shy;fold site that is most
rep&shy;resent&shy;ative of the whole sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat layer, because
sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat is not uniformly distrib&shy;uted about the
body.  Unfor&shy;tunately, the most rep&shy;resent&shy;ative site is not
the same for both sexes, nor is it the same for all ages,
ethnicities, or degree of adiposity.  Hence, it is not
sur&shy;pris&shy;ing that there is no general agree&shy;ment as to the best
single skin&shy;fold site as an index of total body fat.  In the
past, the triceps skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness has been the site most
frequently selected by nutrit&shy;ion&shy;ists for a single, indirect
estimate of body fat.

<p></p>
To account for the differing
distrib&shy;ution of sub&sny;cut&shy;aneous fat, invest&shy;igators often
recom&shy;mend taking one limb skin&shy;fold (right triceps) and one
body skin&shy;fold measure&shy;ment (right subscap&shy;ular).  For example,
persons of African descent tend to have less sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous
fat in the extremities than in the trunk relative to
Caucasians, irre&shy;spec&shy;tive of age and athletic status

<span data-tippy-content="Wagner, D. R., & Heyward, V. H. (2000). Measures of body compo&shy;sition in blacks and whites: a comparative review. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 71(6), 1392–1402.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10837277/"
target="right" >Wagner & Heyward, 2000</a>)</span>.

<p></p>
More than 100 formulae have been
developed to estimate per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat from skin&shy;fold
thick&shy;ness measure&shy;ments alone.  The formulae have been
established across varying populations, using numerous
protocols with deviations in the skin&shy;fold sites meas&shy;ured

Anthropometric Standardization Reference Manual.
Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. *** NOT ON MEDLINE ***">
(<a href=""
target="right" >Lohman et al, 1988</a>).</span>

Unfortun&shy;ately, discrepancies have
been reported when dif&shy;fer&shy;ent formulae are applied on the
same set of individuals.  This finding has led to the
proposal that the sum of skin&shy;fold sites (in mm) (prefer&shy;ably
using eight sites) may provide a more accurate and reliable
outcome of body fat than using an indirect method based on
anthro&shy;pometric-based pre&shy;dic&shy;tion formulae

<p></p>
The measure&shy;ment of multiple skin&shy;folds and not
just a single skin&shy;fold to estimate body fat is partic&shy;ularly
advisable when individuals are undergoing rapid and
pro&shy;nounced weight gain.  Changes in the energy balance are
known to alter the rate of fat accumulation dif&shy;fer&shy;ently
among skin&shy;fold sites

<h3>11.1.3 Body adiposity index</h3>

The body adiposity index (BAI) is a surrogate measure of
adiposity which is calculated as:
\[ \small \mbox{BAI (%fat)}
= \frac {\mbox{Hip cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence}}{\mbox{(Height)}^{1.5}} &minus; \mbox{18}\]
The body adiposity index (BAI) was developed by Bergman et&nbsp;al.

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21372804/"
target="right" >2011</a>)</span>

in part as a result of
the inability of BMI to distinguish between fat and fat-free mass.
Several studies of adults have reported positive
correlations of BAI with BMI and waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence

<h3>11.1.4 Arm-fat area</h3>

The calculated cross-sectional area of arm fat, derived from
skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness
and arm cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence meas&shy;ure&shy;ments, has
been used as an index of total body fat, especially in
emer&shy;gency settings.  Arm-fat area correlates more
signif&shy;icantly with total body fat (i.e., fat weight) than
does a single skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness at the same site.  In
contrast, the estimation of percen&shy;tage of body fat from arm
fat area is no better than the corres&shy;ponding estimation from
the skin&shy;fold measure&shy;ment, particularly in males

<span data-tippy-content="Himes, J. H., Roche, A. F., & Webb, P. (1980). Fat areas as esti&shy;mates of total body fat. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 33(10), 2093–2100.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7424806/"
target="right" >Himes et al., 1980</a>)</span>.

<p></p>
The advantage of using arm-fat area to
estimate body fat is expected; more fat is needed to cover a
large arm with a given thick&shy;ness of sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat than to
cover a smaller arm with the same thick&shy;ness of fat.
Subcutaneous fat, however, is not evenly distributed around
the limbs or trunk.  For example, triceps skin&shy;folds are
consistently larger than the corres&shy;ponding biceps skin&shy;fold,
and, as a result, either the sum or the average of these
should theoretically be used for the calculation of
mid-upper-arm-fat area

<span data-tippy-content="Himes, J. H., Roche, A. F., & Webb, P. (1980). Fat areas as esti&shy;mates of total body fat. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 33(10), 2093–2100.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7424806/"
target="right" >Himes et al., 1980</a>)</span>.

In practice, however, limb fat area refer&shy;ence data are only avail&shy;able
based on triceps skin&shy;fold and mid-upper-arm cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence
(MUAC) measure&shy;ments

used for these measure&shy;ments; for details see Sections&nbsp;11.1.1
and&nbsp;11.2.1.

<h3>Calculation of arm-fat area</h3>

The equation for calculating mid-upper-arm-fat area is:

\[ \small \mbox{AFA} &equals; \mbox{(SKF }&nbsp;&times;&nbsp; \mbox{ MUAC/2)}
 &minus; (&pi; &nbsp; &times;&nbsp; \mbox{ (SKF})^{2}/4)\]

where AFA &equals; mid-upper-arm-fat area (mm<sup>2</sup>),
MUAC&nbsp;&equals;&nbsp;mid-upper-arm cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence (mm),
and SKF&nbsp;&equals;&nbsp;triceps skin&shy;fold
thick&shy;ness (mm).  This equation is based on several
assump&shy;tions, each of which may result in inac&shy;curacies,
leading to an under&shy;estimate of the degree of adiposity

<span data-tippy-content="Rolland-Cachera, M. F., Brambilla, P., Manzoni, P., Akrout, M., Sironi, S., Del Maschio, A., & Chiumello, G. (1997).

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9174464/"
target="right" >Rolland-Cachera et al., 1997</a>)</span>.

The equation assumes that
the limb is cylin&shy;drical, with fat evenly distrib&shy;uted about
its cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence, and also makes no allow&shy;ance for variable
skin&shy;fold com&shy;press&shy;ibility.
This com&shy;press&shy;ibility prob&shy;ably
varies with age, sex, and site of the measure&shy;ment, as well
as among indi&shy;vid&shy;uals, and is a source of error in population
studies when equal com&shy;press&shy;ibility of skin&shy;folds is assumed.
<p></p>
Arm-fat areas calculated from this equation
were reported to agree within 10% to values meas&shy;ured by
com&shy;puterized axial tomography on normal weight adults.
How&shy;ever, for obese subjects, differences were greater than 50%

target="right" >Heymsfield et al., 1982</a>)</span>.

A correction for skin&shy;fold
com&shy;press&shy;ibility may be advisable in future studies.
<p></p>
A simplified index has also been proposed,
the upper-arm-fat estimate (UFE in cm<sup>2</sup>)
			
 \[ \small \mbox{UFE} &equals; \mbox{MUAC }&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;\mbox{ TSF/2}\]

This equation was vali&shy;dated by comparing arm-fat areas assessed
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and anthropometry in
11&nbsp;obese and 17&nbsp;control children.  Both the traditional
upper-arm-fat area and the upper-arm-fat estimate (UFE) were
calculated.  Results indicated that the UFE meas&shy;ure&shy;ments
were close to the MRI esti&shy;mates

<h3>11.1.5 Calculation of body fat from anthropometric
variables via body density</h3>

Measurements of anthropometric variables from
multiple anatomical sites, including skinfolds, are also used to estimate body
density from which the per&shy;cent&shy;age of body fat, and
subsequently total body fat are calculated.  The method
involves:
<ol>
<li>Determination of appro&shy;priate skin&shy;folds
and other anthropometric measure&shy;ments for the pre&shy;dic&shy;tion of
body density; the selection of the sites depends on the age,
sex, ethnicity/race, and population group under investigation</li>

<li>Calculation of body density, using an appro&shy;priate prediction equation</li>

<li>Calculation of per&shy;cent&shy;age of body fat
from body density using an empirical den&shy;sito&shy;metric equation</li>

<li>Calculation of total body fat and/or the fat-free mass:
</li></ol>

\[ \small \mbox{Total body fat (kg)} &equals; \mbox{body weight (kg) &times; % body fat / 100}\]
\[ \small \mbox{Fat-free mass (kg)} &equals; \mbox{body weight (kg) &minus; total body fat (kg)}\]
<p></p>
<b>Choice of appro&shy;priate anthropometric variables
to estimate body density (Steps 1 and 2)</b>

<p></p>
Many studies have invest&shy;igated the best combin&shy;ation
of skin&shy;folds and
other anthro&shy;pometric meas&shy;ure&shy;ments from which to derive a
regres&shy;sion equation for the initial estim&shy;ation of body

<p></p>
Numerous pre&shy;dic&shy;tion
equations are avail&shy;able to estimate body density from
anthro&shy;pometric vari&shy;ables for popul&shy;ation groups ranging from
sedentary to athletic and from children to the elderly

Rarely have the studies recom&shy;mended
the same combination of measure&shy;ments.  The selection of the
most appro&shy;priate pre&shy;dic&shy;tion equation should be based on the
charact&shy;er&shy;istics of the population on which the chosen
equation was originally vali&shy;dated.

<p></p>
Several studies have examined the predictive accuracy and the applicab&shy;ility
of the pre&shy;dic&shy;tion form&shy;ulae avail&shy;able for estim&shy;ating body
density and sub&shy;sequ&shy;ently per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat.  For example,
Provyn et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Provyn S, Scafoglieri A, Tresignie J, Lume C, Clarys JP, Bautmans I (2011). Critical appraisal of selected body compo&shy;sition data. Acquisition techniques in public health. Vrije Universiteit Brussel Belgium.">

reported that even when the chosen
pre&shy;dictive form&shy;ulae were matched to the charact&shy;er&shy;istics of
the popul&shy;ation (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, activity
level) on which the equation was originally valid&shy;ated, the
pre&shy;dic&shy;tion form&shy;ulae invest&shy;igated
(n&equals;57) were not neces&shy;sarily
reliable tools for pre&shy;dicting per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat in
Caucasian adults.  This conclusion was based on the
per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat esti&shy;mates generated from dual-energy
X&#8209;ray absorp&shy;tiometry (DXA), and con&shy;firmed earlier from body
fat data (in g) generated from direct dissection of domestic
porcine hind legs

<span data-tippy-content="Provyn, S., Clarys, J. P., Wallace, J., Scafoglieri, A., & Reilly, T. (2008). Quality control, accuracy, and pre&shy;dic&shy;tion capacity of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry variables and data acquisition. Journal of physiological anthropology, 27(6), 317–323.">

Hence, the application of these pre&shy;dic&shy;tion formulae for estim&shy;ating
per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat on age-matched, apparently healthy
indiv&shy;iduals remains question&shy;able.

<p></p>
Certainly, these
pre&shy;dic&shy;tion formulae should not be used to pre&shy;dict body
density in under&shy;nourished individuals, as there is a
decreasing correl&shy;ation between skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness and total
body fat content with increas&shy;ing severity of under&shy;nutrition.
This change in correlation may arise from a shift of fat
storage from the regions repres&shy;ented by the subscap&shy;ular and
triceps skin&shy;folds to other sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous sites.
Alter&shy;natively, a shift from sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous to deep visceral
sites may occur

<p></p>
<b>Calculation of
per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat from body density using empirical
equations (Step 3)</b>

<p></p>
In most cases, the final stage in
the calcul&shy;ation of the per&shy;cent&shy;age
of body fat (F) from measure&shy;ments of skin&shy;folds and other
anthro&shy;pometric variables is the selec&shy;tion of an empir&shy;ical
den&shy;sito&shy;metric equa&shy;tion relating fat content
to body density (D). Several den&shy;sito&shy;metric equations
have been derived based on the two&#8209;com&shy;ponent model
for body compo&shy;sition in which body weight is
divided into fat and fat&#8209;free mass, relying
on assumptions that ignore inter-indiv&shy;idual
vari&shy;ability in the compo&shy;sition of fat-free mass.
All the clas&shy;sical den&shy;sito&shy;metric equa&shy;tions assume:
(a) the density of the fat&#8209;free mass is relatively
con&shy;stant; (b) the density of fat for normal persons
does not vary among indiv&shy;iduals; (c) the water content
of the fat-free mass is con&shy;stant; and (d) the
pro&shy;por&shy;tion of bone mineral (i.e., skel&shy;eton) to muscle
in the fat-free body is constant.
All authors used the equation:

\[ \small \mbox{%F} &equals; \mbox{((C}_{1}/\mbox{D)}
&minus; \mbox{C}_{2}\mbox{) }&times;\mbox{ 100%} \]

but dif&shy;ferent authors
used dif&shy;ferent values for the density of fat
and the fat-free mass and as a result the
values for C<SUB>1</SUB> and C<sub>2</sub>
differ slightly:

None of these classical empirical equations relating fat
content to body density, however, are suit&shy;able in adult
patients in whom the com&shy;pos&shy;ition of fat-free mass may be abnormal.
This will include patients under&shy;going
hyper&shy;aliment&shy;ation with high-sodium fluids,
or with con&shy;ges&shy;tive heart failure or liver disease,
as total body water content as a fraction of fat-free mass
may be markedly higher in these patients,
thus vio&shy;lating the assumption that the water
content of the fat-free mass is constant

<span data-tippy-content="Heymsfield, S. B., & Casper, K. (1987). Anthropometric assessment of the adult hospitalized patient. JPEN. Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition, 11(5 Suppl), 36S–41S.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3312693/"
target="right" >Heymsfield & Casper, 1987</a>)</span>.

In these circumstances, the density of fat-free mass
is decreased. Not surprisingly, in patients
with diseases associ&shy;ated with under-mineral&shy;isation,
the density of fat-free mass is also decreased.
Consequently, in all these patients, fatness
will be overestimated

More recent research has raised concerns over the
assumption of constant proper&shy;ties for hydration and
density of fat-free mass when these classical
empirical equations are applied to assess body com&shy;pos&shy;ition
not only in patients with certain diseases,
but also in healthy children and adol&shy;escents,
the elderly, and those with obesity.
Although fat has relatively uniform proper&shy;ties through&shy;out
the life course (zero water and a density of 0.9007kg/L),
fat-free mass, in contrast, has dif&shy;fer&shy;ent proper&shy;ties in
children com&shy;pared to adults. This arises because of
chemical maturation of the fat-free mass during
growth which results in higher levels of water and
lower levels of mineral and proteins.
Never&shy;the&shy;less, the adult-derived values for the density and
hydration of fat-free mass and applied in the
classical equa&shy;tions have often been used to
study body compo&shy;sition in children.

Their findings also suggest that modifying the assumptions
regarding both the density and hydration values for
fat-free mass applied in the classical
den&shy;sito&shy;metric empirical equations may
also be appro&shy;priate for the elderly and in conditions of obesity.
<p></p>
Recognition for the need to modify these classical
empir&shy;ical equa&shy;tions which assume constant
proper&shy;ties of fat-free mass (hydration and density)
has led to an increase in the measure&shy;ment of body
compo&shy;sition <i>in vivo</i> using the 4&#8209;com&shy;ponent model.
This method is con&shy;sid&shy;ered the gold standard for
measur&shy;ing body compo&shy;sition because it reduces the
need for theoret&shy;ical assump&shy;tions.

<h3>11.1.6 Waist-hip cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence ratio</h3>

The waist-hip cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence
ratio (waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence divided
by hip cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence) (WHR) is a simple method for
distinguishing between fatness in the lower trunk (hip and
buttocks) and fatness in the upper trunk (waist and abdomen
areas).  Lower trunk fatness (i.e., lower waist to hip
ratio) is often referred to as &ldquo;gynoid obesity&rdquo; because it
is more typical of females.  Upper trunk or central fatness
(higher waist to hip ratio) is called &ldquo;android obesity&rdquo; and
is more characteristic of males.  Never&shy;the&shy;less, obese men
and women can be, and often are, classified into either
group.
<p></p>
The fat depots assessed by the WHR are mainly
sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous (exter&shy;nal or outer) and vis&shy;ceral (inter&shy;nal or
deep).  Use of the WHR rose dramatic&shy;ally follow&shy;ing several
reports confirming that WHR separately or in combin&shy;ation
with BMI was assoc&shy;iated with increased risk of death,
coronary heart disease and type&nbsp;2 diabetes mellitus

The applic&shy;ation of new labor&shy;atory methods including com&shy;puter
tomog&shy;raphy and magnetic resonance imaging has led to
semi-quant&shy;itative estim&shy;ates of the total fat stored within
the abdomen (i.e., intra-abdom&shy;inal fat).

were the first investigators to show highly
significant correlations between intra-abdom&shy;inal fat
(visceral adipose tissue) and the ratio of waist-to-hip
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence.  Their findings led to the proposal that the
meta&shy;bolic compli&shy;cations of obesity shown to be assoc&shy;iated
with a high WHR, may be related specifically to the amount
of intra-abdom&shy;inal (visceral) fat.  Recently, in a
meta-analysis of 21&nbsp;pro&shy;spec&shy;tive cohort studies in which
waist-hip ratio was meas&shy;ured as an indic&shy;ator of abdom&shy;inal
obesity, the risk of cardio&shy;vas&shy;cular disease rose contin&shy;ually
with the increase in WHR when they exceeded a certain range

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33431092/"
target="right" >Xue et al., 2021</a>)</span>.

Based on these results the
investigators advised that men should keep their WHR below&nbsp;0.9
to maintain cardio&shy;vas&shy;cular fitness, whereas women should
keep their WHR as small as possible within the normal
range.

the WHR was also reported to increase with age in both men and women
(<a href="#figure11.8">Figure&nbsp;11.8</a>), and to be
higher in men than in women.

<p></p>
There is also some evidence that WHR varies with eth&shy;nicity.  In the MONICA
project, a stan&shy;dard pro&shy;to&shy;col was used to measure waist and
hip cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence in men and women age 25&#8209;64y in
19&nbsp;countries.  Mean waist-hip ratio
varied con&shy;sid&shy;erably
among the study popul&shy;ation, ranging from 0.87&#8209;0.99 for
men and from 0.76&#8209;0.84 for women.  To date, most of the
evidence for race/ethnic differences
relates to Asian adults in whom lower WHRs have been associ&shy;ated with an increased meta&shy;bolic risk com&shy;pared to Europeans, prob&shy;ably because of higher body fat and visceral adipose tissue

<h3>Measurement of waist-hip ratio</h3>

WHO

<span data-tippy-content=" WHO (2011) Waist circumference and waist-hip ratio: report of a WHO expert consultation, Geneva, 8-11December 2008">

has recom&shy;mended
stan&shy;dard&shy;ized protocols for the measure&shy;ments of waist and hip
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence for inter&shy;nat&shy;ional use. WHO

<span data-tippy-content=" WHO (2011) Waist circumference and waist-hip ratio: report of a WHO expert consultation, Geneva, 8-11December 2008">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241501491"
target="right" >2011</a>)</span>

consid&shy;ered the follow&shy;ing elements when devel&shy;oping the protocols:
anat&shy;om&shy;ical place&shy;ment of
the measur&shy;ing tape, its tight&shy;ness, and the type of tape used;
the sub&shy;ject's posture, phase of respir&shy;ation, abdom&shy;inal
tension, stomach con&shy;tents, and cloth&shy;ing.

<p></p>
After an extensive review, WHO

<span data-tippy-content=" WHO (2011) Waist circumference and waist-hip ratio: report of a WHO expert consultation, Geneva, 8-11December 2008">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241501491"
target="right" >2011</a>)</span>

concluded that waist
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence should be meas&shy;ured at the mid&shy;point between the
tenth rib (i.e., the lowest rib margin) and the top of the
iliac crest, using a stretch-resistant tape that provides a
constant 100g tension.  Hip cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence should be
meas&shy;ured around the widest portion of the but&shy;tocks, with the
tape parallel to the floor.

<p></p>
To perform the waist-cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence
measure&shy;ment, the lowest rib margin is first
located and marked with a felt tip pen.  The iliac crest is
then palpated in the mid&shy;axil&shy;lary line and the top of the
iliac crest is also marked.  An elastic tape can then be
applied horiz&shy;ontally at the mid-point between the lowest rib
margin and the highest point of the iliac crest:  it is tied
firmly so that it stays in position around the abdomen about
the level of the umbil&shy;icus.  The elastic tape thus defines
the level of the waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence, which can then be
meas&shy;ured by position&shy;ing the stretch-resis&shy;tant tape over the
elastic tape

<span data-tippy-content="Jones, P. R., Hunt, M. J., Brown, T. P., & Norgan, N. G. (1986). Waist-hip cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence ratio and its relation to age and overweight in British men. Human nutrition. Clinical nutrition, 40(3), 239–247.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3721906/"
target="right" >Jones et al., 1986</a>)</span>.

Alternatively, a
wash&shy;able marker can be used to land&shy;mark the loca&shy;tion of the
tape.  The stretch-resis&shy;tant tape used for the measure&shy;ment
should provide a constant 100g tension.  This can be
achieved through the use of a special indicator buckle that
reduces dif&shy;feren&shy;ces in tight&shy;ness.

<p></p>
The subject should
wear little clothing and be asked to stand erect with feet
close together, arms at the side, with their body weight
evenly distrib&shy;uted across the feet.  The subject should be
relaxed and asked to take a few deep, natural breaths.  The
measure&shy;ment should be taken at the end of a normal
expir&shy;ation to prevent the subject from con&shy;tract&shy;ing their
muscles or from holding their breath.  The measure&shy;ment is
taken when the tape is parallel to the floor, and the tape
is snug, but does not com&shy;press the skin.  The reading is
taken to the nearest milli&shy;meter.  Each measure&shy;ment should be
repeated twice.  If the two measure&shy;ments are within 1cm of
one another, the average should be calculated, but if the
difference exceeds 1cm, then the two measure&shy;ments should be
repeated.

<p></p>
For the hip cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence measure&shy;ment, the
subject should stand erect with arms at the side and feet
together, with body weight equally distrib&shy;uted across the
feet.  The measure&shy;ment should be taken with the
stretch-resis&shy;tant tape used for the waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence
measure&shy;ment at the point yield&shy;ing the maximum cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence
over the buttocks.  The tape must be held parallel to the
floor, touching the skin but not indent&shy;ing the soft tissue.
The measure&shy;ment is taken to the nearest millimeter.  Again,
each measure&shy;ment should be taken twice.  If the two
measure&shy;ments are within 1cm of one another, the average
should be calculated, but if the difference exceeds 1cm,
then the two measure&shy;ments should be repeated.  The degree to
which factors such as post&shy;pran&shy;dial status, standing
position, and depth of inspir&shy;ation contribute to error in
the measure&shy;ment of waist-hip cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence ratio is
uncertain.

was the first to suggest that waist-hip ratios &gt;&nbsp;1.0
for men and &gt;&nbsp;0.85 for women indicated abdominal fat
accum&shy;ulation and an increased risk of cardio&shy;vas&shy;cular
com&shy;plic&shy;ations and related deaths.  Sub&shy;sequ&shy;ently, many
coun&shy;tries and settings have identified sex-specific cutoff
points for WHRs, some also recom&shy;mending ethnic&shy;ally based
cutoff points particularly for pop&shy;ula&shy;tions of Asian
descent.  Generally, most of the cutoffs chosen have been
based on disease risk (e.g., cardio&shy;vascular disease, type&nbsp;2
diabetes and risk factors of cardio&shy;vascular disease) and on
hard outcomes such as mortal&shy;ity.  Japan is an exception as
their cutoffs are based on assess&shy;ment of visceral adipose
tissue from com&shy;puter&shy;ized tomog&shy;raphy, and hence on the extent
to which meas&shy;ure&shy;ments pre&shy;dict intra-abdom&shy;inal fat rather
than disease risk

Further, dif&shy;fer&shy;ent con&shy;tri&shy;butions of muscle
mass and bone structure, as well as stature and abdom&shy;inal

WHR and abdom&shy;inal fat

The validity of serial measure&shy;ments of
WHR to measure changes in intra-abdom&shy;inal visceral fat over
time is uncer&shy;tain.  For example, any bene&shy;ficial reduc&shy;tions
in abdom&shy;inal fat will not be evident when a ratio such as
WHR is used if both the numer&shy;ator and denom&shy;inator values
change in response to treatment.  Con&shy;sequently, waist
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence alone is now the pre&shy;fer&shy;red index for
monit&shy;oring loss of visceral adipose tissue, and is discus&shy;sed
below.

<h3>11.1.7 Waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence </h3>

Studies have shown that com&shy;pared with the WHR,
waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence alone
is more strongly associ&shy;ated with the amount of
intra-abdom&shy;inal fat (i.e., visceral fat tissue)

Moreover, with an increase in waist
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence, there is a corres&shy;ponding
increase of visceral adipose tissue, the fat depot known to
convey the strongest health risk.  For example, in a large
study in 29&nbsp;countries waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence and BMI were
meas&shy;ured, and visceral adipose tissue assessed directly
using com&shy;puter tomog&shy;raphy

<span data-tippy-content="Nazare, J. A., Smith, J., Borel, A. L., Aschner, P., Barter, P., Van Gaal, L., Tan, C. E., Wittchen, H.

A global cardio&shy;vascular risk score was also
calcu&shy;lated from the sum of eight individual risk factor
subscores based on a series of clinical bio&shy;markers, all
meas&shy;ured in one labor&shy;atory.  As shown in
<a href="#figure11.10">Figure&nbsp;11.10,</a>
visceral adipose tissue increased
sig&shy;nif&shy;icantly
while liver attenuation (inversely corre&shy;lated with liver fat, a depot of ectopic fat) decreased significantly
across the waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence ter&shy;tiles,
within each of the three BMI categories.
Further, the meas&shy;ured cardio&shy;meta&shy;bolic risk
score reflec&shy;ting the number of cardio&shy;meta&shy;bolic
abnor&shy;mal&shy;ities, was signif&shy;icantly cor&shy;related to visceral
adipose tissue, waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence, and BMI in men and
women.

More recently, with the devel&shy;op&shy;ment of medical imaging, the
detection and measure&shy;ment of fat in areas of the body where
fat is not physio&shy;logically stored has also been made.  These
studies have shown that at any given BMI, excess visceral
adiposity is often assoc&shy;iated with an increased accum&shy;ulation
of fat in nor&shy;mally lean tissues such as the liver, pancreas, heart,
and skel&shy;etal muscle, a con&shy;dition termed ectopic fat
depos&shy;ition.  As noted earlier, emerging evidence suggests
that the depos&shy;ition of ectopic fat might contribute to
increased risk of athero&shy;scler&shy;osis and cardio&shy;meta&shy;bolic risk

An overview of
the potential role of func&shy;tional and dys&shy;func&shy;tional adipose
tissue contrib&shy;uting to increased cardio&shy;meta&shy;bolic risk is
presented in
<a href="#figure11.12">Figure&nbsp;11.12</a>.
In a healthy cardio&shy;meta&shy;bolic profile,
the ability of subcutaneous adipose tissue to expand through hyperplasia
(generation of new fat cells) allows the safe storage of the excess energy from
the diet into a properly expanding subcutaneous 'meta&shy;bolic sink'. When this
process becomes saturated or in a situation where adipose tissue has a limited
ability to expand, there is a spillover of the excess energy, which must be
stored in visceral adipose tissue as well as in normally lean organs such as the
skeletal muscle, the liver, the pancreas, and the heart, a process described as
ectopic fat deposition. Visceral adiposity is associ&shy;ated
with a hyper&shy;lipo&shy;lytic
state resistant to the effect of insulin along with an altered secretion of
adipokines including inflammatory cytokines, whereas a set of meta&shy;bolic
dysfuntions are specifically associ&shy;ated with increased skeletal muscle, liver,
pancreas, and epicardial, pericardial, and intra-myocardial fat.

to the measure&shy;ments of waist
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence may be help&shy;ful as a screen&shy;ing tool to identify

<h3>Measurement of waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence</h3>

A con&shy;sen&shy;sus on the optimal protocol for the measure&shy;ment of
waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence has not yet been reached.  Currently two
sites are used:  (a) at the natural waist, i.e., mid-way
between the tenth rib (the lowest rib margin) and the iliac
crest (i.e., the super&shy;ior border of the wing of the ilium),
as proposed by WHO

and (b) at the umbilicus level

and emphasizes that a
single focus on BMI &gt;&nbsp;25 or &gt;&nbsp;30kg/m<sup>2</sup> is
likely to mask a real increase in the obesity epidemic.
Clearly, waist cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence should be
included along with BMI in all obesity sur&shy;veil&shy;lance studies
in the future to ensure the phenotype of obesity that conveys the greatest health
risk (i.e., abdominal obesity) is identified. This recommendation was made by the
International Atherosclerosis Society (IAs) and the International Chair on
Cardiometabolic Risk (ICCR) working group on visceral obesity. In addition, the
working group have emphasized the impor&shy;tance of
research to refine the WC cutoffs
for a given BMI category

<h3>11.2 Assessment of fat-free mass</h3>

The fat-free mass consists of the skel&shy;etal muscle,
non-skel&shy;etal muscle,
organs, connective tissue, total body water,
and the skel&shy;eton

<span data-tippy-content="Earthman C. P. (2015). Body Composition Tools for Assessment of Adult Malnutrition at the Bedside: A Tutorial on Research Considerations and Clinical Applications. JPEN. Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition, 39(7), 787–822. ">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26287016/"
target="right" >Earthman, 2015</a>).</span>

Based on the two-com&shy;ponent model,
once total body fat has been estim&shy;ated, then
fat-free mass can be deter&shy;mined, as shown below:
<p></p>

\[ \small \mbox{Total body fat (kg)} &equals;
\mbox{body weight (kg) &times; % body fat / 100} \]
<p></p>
\[ \small \mbox{Fat-free mass} &equals;
\mbox{body weight (kg) &minus; body fat (kg)} \]
<p></p>
Therefore, the limit&shy;ations outlined earlier when
using anthro&shy;po&shy;metric variables to assess per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat
based on the two-compo&shy;nent model must also be consid&shy;ered
when assess&shy;ing fat-free mass.  Recog&shy;nition of these
limit&shy;ations is espec&shy;ially important when assess&shy;ing fat-free
mass in under&shy;nourished children with edema

In these cir&shy;cum&shy;stan&shy;ces, the
assump&shy;tions used to convert from raw measure&shy;ments to final
body compo&shy;sition values (see Section 11.1.5) are often
violated.

<p></p>
Muscle is a major compo&shy;nent of the fat-free
mass and the primary site for glucose uptake and storage as
well as a reservoir of amino acids stored as protein, as
noted earlier.  Assess&shy;ment of muscle mass can there&shy;fore
provide an index of the protein reserves of the body, which

These anthro&shy;po&shy;metric measure&shy;ments and indices derived from them
are dis&shy;cussed below.

<h3>11.2.1 Mid-upper-arm cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence</h3>

The arm contains both sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat
and muscle; a decrease in MUAC may there&shy;fore reflect a
reduc&shy;tion in either muscle mass or sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous tissue (or
both).  In some low-income countries, where the amount of
sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat is often small, changes in MUAC tend to
parallel changes in muscle mass and, hence, are some&shy;times
used as in indi&shy;cators of severe and moder&shy;ately severe
under&shy;nutri&shy;tion in young children (age &lt;&nbsp;5y) from
resource-poor settings.  Even in high-income settings,
measure&shy;ment of MUAC is recom&shy;mended as one of the indi&shy;cators
of pediatric mal&shy;nu&shy;trition by the Academy of Nutri&shy;tion and
Diet&shy;etics (AND) and the American Society for Parent&shy;eral and
Enteral Nutri&shy;tion (ASPEN)

MUAC measure&shy;ments are par&shy;ticu&shy;larly
impor&shy;tant for child&shy;ren whose
weight may be affected by edema, ascites, or steroids in the
lower extrem&shy;ities because of fluid retention

Changes in the MUAC measure&shy;ments can also be used to
monitor progress during nutri&shy;tional therapy.

<p></p>
The measure&shy;ment of MUAC requires a minimal amount of time and
equipment, and changes in MUAC are easy to detect.
There&shy;fore, increas&shy;ingly, MUAC is used in emerg&shy;encies such as
famines and refugee crises for screen&shy;ing children with
severe acute mal&shy;nutri&shy;tion (SAM) or mod&shy;erate acute
mal&shy;nutri&shy;tion.  In such situations, the measure&shy;ment of weight
or height may not be feasible, and ages of the children are
often uncertain

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9141745/"
target="right" >de&nbsp;Onis et al., 1997</a>)</span>.

In addition, use of
a weight-based nutrit&shy;ional assess&shy;ment (e.g., WLZ) can be
mis&shy;lead&shy;ing in chil&shy;dren with SAM who frequ&shy;ently have
diar&shy;rheal disease accom&shy;panied by dehyd&shy;ration, which lowers
the weight of a child.  Modi et&nbsp;al.

weight-for-length Z&#8209;score &lt;&nbsp; &minus;3 to identify SAM
in child&shy;ren aged 6&#8209;60mo with diarrhea.

<p></p>
The use of fixed cutoffs to
dis&shy;ting&shy;uish normal and mal&shy;nour&shy;ished
children assumes that MUAC is rel&shy;atively inde&shy;pen&shy;dent of age
for these children.  How&shy;ever, the age inde&shy;pen&shy;dence of MUAC
has been questioned

when MUAC-for-age Z&#8209;score replaced MUAC alone was limited,
based on data from pop&shy;ula&shy;tion surveys from 41&nbsp;coun&shy;tries.
They con&shy;cluded that the addit&shy;ional estim&shy;ation of age,
required when using MUAC-for-age Z&#8209;score, especially in
human&shy;itarian settings, was not just&shy;ified.  They urged the
need for further research on morb&shy;idity and mortal&shy;ity of
children with low MUAC-for-age Z&#8209;scores.

Measurement of MUAC alone has also been used to detect over&shy;weight and
obesity in children and adol&shy;escents in both low&#8209; and
high-income set&shy;tings due to the strong relation with body
weight. Craig et al.

con&shy;cluded that MUAC may have
poten&shy;tial for clin&shy;ical and sur&shy;veil&shy;lance application as an
accurate indic&shy;ator of over&shy;weight and fat&shy;ness in children and
adoles&shy;cence
in place of BMI that requires measurements of both weight and stature.
In their study of black South African children

BMI-for-age and over&shy;fatness from body fatness via
bio&shy;elec&shy;trical impedance (BIA)

studies when weight and stature measure&shy;ments are impos&shy;sible,
MUAC can be used as an altern&shy;ative and valid measure for
detect&shy;ing over&shy;weight and obes&shy;ity.  Cer&shy;tainly, the results of
cross-sectional data from 12&nbsp;coun&shy;tries
rep&shy;re&shy;sent&shy;ing five
major geo&shy;graphic regions of the world suggest that MUAC may
be a promis&shy;ing tool for obesity in resource-poor settings

MUAC is recom&shy;mended because the measure&shy;ment is less affected by
fluid retention com&shy;pared to the lower extremities, a
con&shy;dition that often occurs in older adults.  Sarcopenia is
char&shy;acter&shy;ized by decreases in muscle mass, as well as
strength and func&shy;tion, all of which have multiple adverse
health con&shy;sequ&shy;ences, as noted earlier.  Several studies have
demon&shy;strated that low MUAC is assoc&shy;iated with an increased

<h3>Measurement of mid-upper arm cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence</h3>

Measurements of MUAC should be made using a flexible,
non-stretch tape made of fiberglass or steel; altern&shy;atively,
a fiber&shy;glass insertion tape can be used.  The subject should
stand erect and side&shy;ways to the meas&shy;urer, with the head in
the Frank&shy;furt plane, arms relaxed, and legs apart.  If the
subject is wearing a sleeved garment, it should be removed
or the sleeves should be rolled up.  The measure&shy;ment is
taken at the mid&shy;point of the upper arm, between the acromion
process and the tip of the olecranon
(<a href="#figure11.14">Figure&nbsp;11.14).</a>

After locating the mid&shy;point, the arm is
extended so that it is hanging loosely by the side, with the
palm facing inward.  The tape is then wrapped gently but
firmly around the arm at the mid&shy;point
(<a href="#figure11.14">Figure&nbsp;11.14),</a>
care being taken to ensure that the arm is not squeezed.  MUAC is
often meas&shy;ured at the same time as triceps skin&shy;fold.  In the
WHO Multi&shy;centre Growth Refer&shy;ence Study, MUAC (and skin&shy;fold)
measure&shy;ments were taken on the left side of the body

<p></p>
The MUAC measure&shy;ment tapes are
cheap, widely avail&shy;able, and easy to use so that cases of
SAM can be readily iden&shy;tified at the
com&shy;munity level.  If neces&shy;sary, MUAC can be meas&shy;ured with
subjects in the recum&shy;bent position.  In this case, a sandbag
is placed under the elbow to raise the arm slightly off the
surface of the bed

Measurements are taken to the nearest mm.

<p></p>
Precision of MUAC measure&shy;ments,
both within and between examin&shy;ers, can be
high, even if the subjects are obese, provided that trained
exam&shy;iners and stan&shy;dard&shy;ized methods are used.  High pre&shy;cision
is critical as MUAC varies little at any given age, with
measure&shy;ments tending to form a narrow symmetrical
distri&shy;bution, so that even small errors are signif&shy;icant.  In
the WHO Multi&shy;centre Growth Refer&shy;ence Study, the maximum
allow&shy;able dif&shy;fer&shy;ence for the

<h3>Interpretive criteria</h3>

To classify acute malnu&shy;trition
in children (6&#8209;59mos), a single MUAC cutoff

for low weight-for-height (i.e., WHZ &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2; wasting)

measure&shy;ments of weight and length or height are not
feasible.  For children clas&shy;sified as sev&shy;erely mal&shy;nour&shy;ished,
a MUAC cutoff &lt;&nbsp;115mm is recom&shy;mended, for moder&shy;ately

There is no con&shy;sen&shy;sus on an optimal MUAC cutoff for thinness among
adults, with reported cutoff values ranging from 17.0cm to
25.1cm.  This discrepancy is in part due to the use of

Likewise, there is no con&shy;sen&shy;sus on the MUAC cutoff to pre&shy;dict low
muscle mass and diagnose sarco&shy;penia in adults; cutoffs vary
with sex, age, and possibly race-ethnicity.  For
community-dwelling Chinese adults &gt;&nbsp;50y,

recommend MUAC cutoffs of &lt;&nbsp;28.6cm for men
and &lt;&nbsp;27.5cm for women for predicting low muscle mass,
and &lt;&nbsp;27cm for
both sexes to identify sarco&shy;penia.  This cutoff was
developed based on low muscle mass diagnosed using the
European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People&nbsp;2

Concern that use of a fixed
MUAC cutoff would over diagnose wasting among younger
children and under-diagnose among older children because of
the depend&shy;ence of MUAC on age, as noted earlier,
led WHO to recom&shy;mend the use
of MUAC Z&#8209;scores, which adjust for age and sex differences.
Consequently, WHO has developed MUAC-for-age refer&shy;ence data
(Z&#8209;scores and percent&shy;iles by sex) for children aged 3&#8209;60mo

For example, in a pro&shy;spec&shy;tive
study of older men (60&#8209;79y), MUAMC was signif&shy;icantly and
inversely related to mort&shy;ality, with the pre&shy;dic&shy;tion of
mort&shy;ality being greater when MUAMC was combined with waist
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence

In addition, in
persons 80y or older, MUAMC was posit&shy;ively related to
func&shy;tional perfor&shy;mance as well as survival.  In this study,
func&shy;tional perfor&shy;mance was assessed using the physical
perfor&shy;mance battery score based on three timed tests:  4&#8209;m

Low MUAMC has also been
shown to be assoc&shy;iated with longer hospital stays in
hos&shy;pital&shy;ized adults.  In a study by
Pinto et&nbsp;al.

(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32618361/"
target="right" >2021</a>)</span>,

such an assoc&shy;iation was inde&shy;pen&shy;dently related with
under&shy;nutrition.  MUAMC has also been used to detect low muscle
mass in clinical and primary care settings where assess&shy;ment
of muscle mass using more direct <i>in vivo</i> methods such as
com&shy;puter tomography is not feasible

<span data-tippy-content="Gort-van Dijk, D., Weerink, L., Milovanovic, M., Haveman, J. W., Hemmer, P., Dijkstra, G., Lindeboom, R., & Campmans-Kuijpers, M. (2021).

<p></p>
Never&shy;the&shy;less, it is impor&shy;tant to realize that
the mid-upper-arm-muscle cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence is a one-dimen&shy;sional
measure&shy;ment, whereas mid-upper-arm-muscle area is
two-dimen&shy;sional, and mid-upper-arm-muscle volume is three
dimen&shy;sional.  Con&shy;sequ&shy;ently, if the volume of the
mid-upper-arm muscle declines during under&shy;nutrition or
enlarges follow&shy;ing a program of nutritional support, the
mid-upper-arm-muscle cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence change will be
pro&shy;portion&shy;ally smaller than the change in the mid-upper-arm
muscle area

<span data-tippy-content="Heymsfield, S. B., McManus, C., Smith, J., Stevens, V., & Nixon, D. W. (1982). Anthropometric measure&shy;ment of muscle mass: revised equations for calculating bone-free arm muscle area. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 36(4), 680–690.">

Hence, MUAMC is insensitive to small changes of muscle mass that might
occur, for example, during a brief illness.

<h3>Calculation of mid-upper-arm-muscle cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence</h3>

The equation for the calculation of
mid-upper-arm-muscle cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence (MUAMC) is based
on the same assump&shy;tions as those described for mid-upper-arm
fat area (Section 11.1.4).

Figure&nbsp;11.16  Mid-upper-arm-muscle
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence.
</figcaption></figure>

<br>If MUAC = mid-upper-arm
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence,
TSK = triceps skin&shy;fold, d<sub>1</sub> = arm diameter,
<br>and d<sub>2</sub> = muscle diameter. Then:<br>
TSK = 2 &times; sub&shy;cut&shy;aneous fat (d<sub>1</sub> &minus; d<sub>2</sub>)
and MUAC = &pi; &times; d<sub>1</sub>.
<br>MUAMC
= &pi; &times;  d<sub>2</sub> = &pi; &times; [d<sub>1</sub> &minus; (d<sub>1</sub> &minus; d<sub>2</sub>)]
<br>= &pi;  &times; d<sub>1</sub> &minus; &pi; &times; (d<sub>1</sub> &minus; d<sub>2</sub>). Hence
<br>
<b>MUAMC = MUAC &minus; (&pi; &times; TSK)</b>
<br>
Note that this equation requires all
measure&shy;ments to be in the same units (preferably mm).
<p></p>
As vari&shy;ations in skin&shy;fold
com&shy;press&shy;ibility are ignored, and as the triceps skin&shy;fold of
females is generally more compres&shy;sible than that of males,
MUAMC in females may be under&shy;estim&shy;ated

target="right" >Clegg & Kent, 1967</a>)</span>.

As a further complication, the MUAMC equation does not account
for between subject variation in the diameter of the humerus
relative to MUAC

<h3>11.2.3 Mid-upper-arm-muscle area</h3>

Mid-upper-arm-muscle area (AMA) is said to be
prefer&shy;able to mid-upper-arm-muscle cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence as an index
of total body muscle mass because it more adequately
reflects the true mag&shy;ni&shy;tude of muscle tissue changes

Several studies have examined the
validity of mid-upper-arm-muscle area by com&shy;par&shy;ison with <i>in
vivo</i> body composition refer&shy;ence methods.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and com&shy;puter tomog&shy;raphy (CT) are con&shy;sidered the gold
standard methods for <i>in vivo</i> assess&shy;ment of muscle mass,
although use of bio&shy;elec&shy;trical imped&shy;ance (BIA) and DXA is
increas&shy;ing in clin&shy;ical settings.  Unfor&shy;tun&shy;ately, the
validity of the cal&shy;cu&shy;lated mid-upper-arm-muscle area (AMA)
as a proxy for actual arm-muscle mass is depen&shy;dent on the
charact&shy;er&shy;istics of the study population and the <i>in vivo</i>
refer&shy;ence method used.  For example, the trad&shy;itional

Despite these limitations, calculated AMA as a

investigators.

reported that AMA, like
MUAMC, was linked with length of hospital stay.  In Caucasian
adult patients with AMA values lower than the 5<sup>th</sup> percen&shy;tile
(i.e., indic&shy;ative of deplet&shy;ion), the probab&shy;ility of being
dis&shy;char&shy;ged from the hos&shy;pital was lower. How&shy;ever, this
finding has not been con&shy;sis&shy;tent in all studies

AMA has also served as an early indicator of
de&shy;terior&shy;ating
nutrit&shy;ional status in a long&shy;itud&shy;inal study of
pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis

AMA usually increases in adults up to age 65y
in women and up to middle age in men, and then steadily
decreases, as observed for MUAMC.  Caution must be used,
however, when inter&shy;pret&shy;ing estim&shy;ates of AMA among adults who
are obese or those with triceps skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness that
exceeds the 85<sup>th</sup> age-and sex-specific per&shy;cent&shy;iles.  In such
persons, esti&shy;mates of AMA by anthro&shy;pometry are said to
over&shy;estimate AMA deter&shy;mined by com&shy;puterized tomography, the
degree of over&shy;estim&shy;ation varying directly with the degree of
adi&shy;posity

<h3>Calculation of mid-upper-arm-muscle area</h3>

The follow&shy;ing equation may
be used to estimate mid-upper-arm-muscle area (AMA):

\[ \small \mbox{Arm muscle area}
= \mbox{(MUAC &minus; (&pi; &times; TSK))}^{2}\mbox{/4&pi;}\]

where MUAC &equals; mid-upper-arm cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence and TSK &equals; triceps
skin&shy;fold thick&shy;ness

<span data-tippy-content="Frisancho A. R. (1981). New norms of upper limb fat and muscle areas for assessment of nutritional status. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 34(11), 2540–2545.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6975564/"
target="right" >Frisancho, 1981</a>)</span>.

Consistent units, preferably mm, should be used throughout.  The index is
based on the follow&shy;ing assumptions:

<ul>
<li> The mid-upper-arm cross-section is circular.
<li> The triceps
skin&shy;fold is twice the average adipose tissue rim diameter at
the middle of the upper arm.
<li> The mid-upper-arm-muscle
com&shy;ponent is circular in cross-section.  <li> Bone atrophies
in pro&shy;por&shy;tion to muscle wastage during protein-energy
malnutrition.
</li></ul>
The cross-sectional areas of neuro&shy;vas&shy;cular
tissue and the humerus are relat&shy;ively small and ignored.
The first three assump&shy;tions are those used in the
calcul&shy;ations of mid-upper-arm-fat area and mid-upper-arm
muscle cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence.  Several investig&shy;ators have reported
the equation shown above over&shy;esti&shy;mates arm-muscle area
com&shy;pared with values based on <i>in vivo</i> refer&shy;ence methods such
as com&shy;puter axial tomo&shy;graphy

As a result, revised equations have been developed.
How&shy;ever, their use has been limited, in part because the
corrected formulae have only been vali&shy;dated in selected
popu&shy;lation groups, and popu&shy;lation-specific corrected
equ&shy;ations may be needed.

<h3>11.2.4 Calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence</h3>

The quantity of skel&shy;etal muscle (i.e.,
muscle mass) changes over the life course:  increas&shy;ing
during growth in child&shy;hood, stabil&shy;izing in mid&shy;life, after
which muscle mass declines with ageing.  In mid&shy;life in
adults about 30% of the skel&shy;etal muscle is in the lower
limbs, although after age 50y, the amount declines, with
losses of &#126;1&#8209;2% per year

Calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence is often used as a surrogate
marker of skel&shy;etal muscle mass.  The measure&shy;ment is simple
and practical and was reported as the most used measure&shy;ment
in clinical practice to assess muscle mass, based on an
inter&shy;national survey in 55&nbsp;countries

Calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence has the added advantage of having a lower
fat mass com&shy;pared to other body sites.  As a result, the
impact of fat mass on the measure&shy;ments will be less

The U.S. adult age groups
studied were:  18&#8209;20y; 20&#8209;39y;40&#8209;59y; >60y and their
ethnicities were:  Mexican American;
African America, White, Other.
A pre&shy;dic&shy;tion
equation was developed based on calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence and age,
sex, and ethnicity or self-reported race.

<p></p>
In a later study
employing the same NHANES 1999&#8209;2006 dataset, calf
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence cutoff values
for U.S. adults according to sex, ethnicity and race
were defined as a marker to
identify low muscle mass, vali&shy;dated by DXA measure&shy;ments

<span data-tippy-content="Gonzalez, M. C., Mehrnezhad, A., Razaviarab, N., Barbosa-Silva, T. G., & Heymsfield, S. B. (2021). Calf circumference: cutoff values from the NHANES 1999-2006. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 113(6), 1679–1687. ">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33742191/"
target="right" >Gonzalez et al., 2021</a>)</span>.

With these cutoff values, sarco&shy;penia could be diagnosed,
not only in older par&shy;tic&shy;ipants, but across the full adult
life&shy;span.  Factors con&shy;found&shy;ing the calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence
measure&shy;ments across the entire adult life&shy;span were also
ident&shy;ified.  In addition to sex and ethnic or self-reported
race ident&shy;ified earlier as con&shy;found&shy;ers, BMI was also shown
to be a very impor&shy;tant con&shy;founder in this later study.  Calf
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence values were reported to be lower for those
with BMI &lt;&nbsp;18.5(kg/m<sup>2</sup>), but higher for those over&shy;weight or
obese com&shy;pared to those with a normal BMI, irre&shy;spec&shy;tive of
age, ethnicity, or race.
Further, the confounding effect of
adiposity could be removed by applying BMI adjust&shy;ment
factors for calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence for those partic&shy;ipants
outside the normal-weight BMI range (i.e., BMI 18&#8209;24.9) (see
Table&nbsp;11.11).  Hence, by apply&shy;ing these BMI adjust&shy;ment
factors, the con&shy;found&shy;ing effects of adi&shy;posity can be removed
so that low calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence under any BMI can be
identified.

<p></p>
Such an adjust&shy;ment could also result in
a stronger correlation of calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence with function.
Therefore, in the future, BMI-adjusted calf cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence
measure&shy;ments should be valid&shy;ated for pre&shy;dic&shy;ating
sarco&shy;penia-related health outcome such as functional
impair&shy;ments, falls, and mortal&shy;ity.  Studies employ&shy;ing the

Without these adjustments, raw calf circumference measurements
would result in an underestimate of the prevalence of
low calf circumference in those with BMI &ge;&nbsp;25 and an
over&shy;estimate in those with a BMI &lt;&nbsp;18.5.
<p></p>
By applying these BMI adjust&shy;ment factors, a stronger correlation of calf

<h3>11.2.5 Hand grip strength</h3>

Research suggests that a measure of muscle mass such as calf
cir&shy;cum&shy;fer&shy;ence should be com&shy;ple&shy;mented with measures of muscle
strength

by more than 50% in
in the elderly (70&#8209;82y) com&shy;pared to that in young men (18&#8209;30y).
More&shy;over, only half the decrease in
muscle strength that occurs with aging is accounted
for by a decrease in the volume of muscle

Handgrip strength is said to be a better predictor of func&shy;tional
health out&shy;comes than low muscle mass.  Several func&shy;tional
health out&shy;comes have been used to define optimum hand grip
strength in the elderly.  They include slow meas&shy;ured walking

<h3>Measurement of hand grip strength </h3>

Accurate measure&shy;ment of hand grip strength
requires use of a calib&shy;rated hand&shy;held dynamo&shy;meter.  The
hydraulic hand dynamo&shy;meter Jamar measures
grip force (kgf) and is accep&shy;ted as the gold standard
instru&shy;ment.  The Jamar dynamo&shy;meter is small and portable,
although relatively heavy (i.e.,1.5 lb), with a dial that
reads force in both kilograms and pounds, and allows
assess&shy;ment to the nearest 1kg or 2.5 lb.  In Asia, the
spring-type dynamo&shy;meter (Smedley) that detects the amount of
spring tension (kgf) is more widely used.  Data generated by
these two devices are not comparable

Never&shy;the&shy;less, the AWGS 2019 recommend using either device,
provided standard measure&shy;ment protocols for the device are
followed

Measurement of grip
strength obtained by dynamo&shy;metry appears to have good to
excellent relative test-retest relia&shy;bility, even among older
adults

Dynamo&shy;meters should be calibrated
every 4&#8209;6mos to maintain long&shy;itud&shy;inal validity.
The methods used to measure grip strength vary.  Consequently,
Roberts et&nbsp;al.

have developed a stan&shy;dard&shy;ized method
to increase the pre&shy;cision of measure&shy;ments within any given
study, and to facil&shy;itate com&shy;parison of results across
studies.  Never&shy;the&shy;less, other factors unrelated to muscle,
such as motiv&shy;ation or cogni&shy;tion, may hamper the correct
assess&shy;ment of muscle strength.  Details of this stan&shy;dard&shy;ized
method are outlined in Box&nbsp;11.1.

</b>

<ol>
<li> Sit the participant comfortably in a standard
chair with legs, back support and fixed arms. Use
the same chair for every measure&shy;ment. <li> Ask
them to rest their forearms on the arms of the
chair with their wrist just over the end of the arm
of the chair—wrist in a neutral position, thumb
facing upwards. <li> Demonstrate how to use the
Jamar handgrip dynamometer to show that gripping
very tightly registers the best score. <li> Start
with the right hand. <li> Position the hand so that
the thumb is round one side of the handle and
the four fingers are around the other side. The
instrument should feel comfortable in the hand.
Alter the position of the handle if necessary.
<li> The observer should rest the base of the dynamometer
on the palm of their hand as the subject
holds the dynamometer. The aim of this is to
support the weight of the dynamometer (to negate
the effect of gravity on peak strength), but care
should be taken not to restrict its movement.
<li> Encourage the participant to squeeze as long and
as tightly as possible or until the needle stops
rising. Once the needle stops rising the participant
can be instructed to stop squeezing. <li> Read grip
strength in kilograms from the outside dial and
record the result to the nearest 1kg on the data
entry form. <li> Repeat measure&shy;ment in the left
hand. <li> Do two further measure&shy;ments for each
hand alternating sides to give three readings in
total for each side. <li> The best of the six grip
strength measure&shy;ments is used in statistical analyses
so as to encourage the subjects to get as high
a score as possible. <li> Also record hand dominance,
i.e. right, left or ambidextrous (people who
can genuinely write with both hands) and the equipment model used.

than sitting with 90&deg; elbow flexion as described in Box&nbsp;11.1

<h3>Interpretive criteria</h3>

As noted earlier, although the measure&shy;ments
generated from dynamo&shy;meters differ depen&shy;ding on the device
used, currently dynamo&shy;meter-specific cutoff values are not
recommended because of insuf&shy;ficient comparative data

life course from the U.K, U.S.&nbsp;Germany, and the U.S.&nbsp;are
discussed briefly below.
In the United Kingdom for example,
percentiles (10th, 25<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>,
75<sup>th</sup>, 90<sup>th</sup>) by sex for grip
strength based on cross-sectional obser&shy;vations in persons
aged 4&#8209;90y from 12&nbsp;U.K. studies have been compiled

In Germany, the normative refer&shy;ence values are based
on a nationally representative sample of healthy
partic&shy;ipants aged 17&#8209;90y.  Mean values for hand&shy;grip strength
across seven height groups (within each age group:
17&#8209;19y, 20&#8209;24y, 25&#8209;29y,
30&#8209;34y, 35&#8209;39y, 40&#8209;44y, 45&#8209;49y)
were calcu&shy;lated and pre&shy;sented as sex-specific refer&shy;ence
values, strat&shy;ified by age and body height.  For example, the
refer&shy;ence value for 40&#8209;44y women with a height of
165&#8209;169cm is 34.8kg; this value increases by about 1kg
for every 5cm of additional height, as shown in

Note that because all these normative
refer&shy;ence values are based on cross-sect&shy;ional data, they are
likely to under&shy;estimate indi&shy;vidual decline and hence should
not be used to monitor the tra&shy;ject&shy;ories of indiv&shy;iduals.
Moreover, as with all cross-sectional studies, such a design
limits the degree to which causal and age-related inference
can be drawn
