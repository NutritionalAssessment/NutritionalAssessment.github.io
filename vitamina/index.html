<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Vitamin&nbsp;A is a generic term for all retinoids that
qualitatively exhibit the biological activity of all-trans
retinol and are only found in foods of animal origin.
Certain carot-enoids with provitamin&nbsp;A activity, most
notably &beta;&#8209;carotene, &beta;&#8209;crypto&shy;xanthin, and &alpha;&#8209;carotene, are
found in both plant and animal products, although in
low-income countries, yellow and orange-colored fruits and
dark-green leafy vegetables are the major dietary sources.
Vitamin&nbsp;A has a clearly defined role in vision, with ocular
lesions characteristic of vitamin&nbsp;A deficiency.  In early
deficiency, however, signs include growth failure, loss of
appetite, and impaired immune response with lowered
resistance to infection.
<p></p>
The best index of vitamin&nbsp;A status is liver vitamin&nbsp;A
stores; measurements below 9.1&micro;mol/g indicate vitamin&nbsp;A
deficiency.  However, such a measurement is impractical in
population studies.  Instead, retinol concentrations in
serum or dried blood spots are frequently determined, even
though they do not reflect body stores until they are
severely depleted or excessively high.  At a population
level, WHO recommend a serum retinol cutoff of &lt;0.70&micro;mol/L to
indicate whether vitamin&nbsp;A deficiency is likely to be a
public health problem.  Serum or dried blood spot
concentrations of retinol-binding protein (RBP), a specific
vitamin&nbsp;A transport protein, may also be used as a surrogate
measure for serum retinol.  RBP can be performed using
fingerstick blood samples, and the sample collection and
analysis (by enzyme immunoassay) are easier and cheaper
than for serum retinol.  However, no consensus exists on a
cutoff value for RBP equivalent to a serum retinol
concentration of &lt;0.70&micro;mol/L.  Serum carotenoids may serve
as a useful secondary index of vitamin&nbsp;A intake when the
major sources of vitamin&nbsp;A are dietary carotenoids from
plants.  Breast milk retinol concentrations can be used to
assess suboptimal vitamin&nbsp;A status of lactating mothers, and
as an indirect indicator of the vitamin&nbsp;A status of
breastfed infants.  At a population level, WHO recommend a
breast milk retinol cutoff of &lt;1.05&micro;mol/L to indicate
whether vitamin&nbsp;A deficiency is likely to be a public health
problem.  Elevated serum retinyl ester concentrations (i.e.,
&gtrdot;7.5% or 5% of total vitamin&nbsp;A for adults and children,
respectively) in fasting blood samples can be used to assess
vitamin&nbsp;A toxicity.  Several factors influence
concentrations of serum retinol, RBP, and carotenoids,
reducing the sensitivity and specificity of the tests.
Conditions of collection, storage, and analysis of serum and
breast milk should be carefully controlled.  HPLC is the
preferred analytical method for retinol, carotenoids, and
retinyl ester.
<p></p>
The physiological functional tests for vitamin&nbsp;A status
include the relative dose response or modified relative dose
response, assessment of night blindness, the rapid dark
adaptation test, and pupillary and visual threshold test.
The relative dose response tests can be used to estimate
liver stores of vitamin&nbsp;A and thereby identify individuals
with marginal vitamin&nbsp;A deficiency.  Maternal subjective
night blindness assessment is elicited by personal
interviews, with a prevalence of > 5% indicative of a
significant public health problem for vitamin&nbsp;A deficiency.
Before night blindness develops, disturbances in dark
adaptation occur which can be detected by the rapid dark
adaptation test (RDAT).  However, this test is not very
sensitive to early signs of vitamin&nbsp;A deficiency, and cannot
be used for testing preschool children, so is rarely used
today.  Instead, the pupillary and visual threshold test,
which can be conducted on individuals of all ages using a
portable field dark adaptometer, is used.  A population mean
score of less than &minus;1.11 log cd/m<sup>2</sup> indicates vitamin&nbsp;A
deficiency.  The retinol isotope dilution (RID) test in
which an individual is given an oral dose of isotopically
labeled vitamin&nbsp;A, is the only method that indirectly
provides a quantitative measure of the hepatic stores of
vitamin&nbsp;A. Vitamin A deficiency is defined when liver
vitamin&nbsp;A concentration is &lt;0.10&micro;mol/g liver.  In the
future, RID tests will be possible in subsets of population
surveys.

<h2>Vitamin&nbsp;A</h2>

<h3>18a.1 Introduction</h3>

Vitamin&nbsp;A is a generic term for all retinoids that qualitatively exhibit the biological 
activity of all<i>-trans</i> retinol. The various biologically active forms of vitamin&nbsp;A are 
shown in Figure 18a.1. Certain carot&shy;enoids have pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A activity. Of these,
&alpha;&#8209;carotene,  &beta;&#8209;carotene, and  &beta;&#8209;crypto&shy;xanthin 
are the most widely studied.  &beta;&#8209;carotene
is unique because it can theoret&shy;ically yield two molecules of retinal, which are 
subse&shy;uently reduced to retinol.

<h3>18a.1.1 Functions of vitamin&nbsp;A</h3>

Vitamin&nbsp;A has a clearly defined role in vision: when retinal tissue is deprived of 
vitamin&nbsp;A, rod and cone function is impaired. However, only the bio&shy;chem&shy;ical role 
of the 11<i>-cis</i> retinaldehyde form of vitamin&nbsp;A, in the visual process in rod cells, has 
been studied in detail. Vitamin&nbsp;A is required for the integrity of epithelial cells 
through&shy;out the body.  The regulatory action of retinoic acid at the level of the gene 
has an impor&shy;tant role in growth, embryonic development, and maintenance of 
immune function. Both cell-mediated immunity and systemic and mucosal 
humoral immunity are affected. A review by Tanumihardjo et al.

<h3>18a.1.2 Vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency in humans</h3>

Early signs of vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency in humans include growth failure, loss of 
appetite, and impaired immune response with lowered resistance to infection.  
Xerophthalmia are the sequelae asso&shy;ci&shy;ated with the eye during extreme vitamin&nbsp;A 
defi&shy;ciency. Night blindness develops when liver reserves of vitamin&nbsp;A are nearly 
exhausted. If not corrected, ocular lesions such as conjunctival xerosis, Bitot's 
spots, kerato&shy;malacia, and blindness may occur. In the past, conjunc&shy;tival impression 
cytology (CIC) was used to detect early physio&shy;logical changes charac&shy;teristic of 
vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency. Such changes include both the progres&shy;sive loss of goblet 
cells in the conjunctiva and the appearance of enlarged, partially keratin&shy;ized, 
epithelial cells 

<span data-tippy-content="Wittpenn JR, Tseng SC, Sommer A. Detection of early 
xerophthalmia by impression cytology. Arch Ophthalmol. 1986 Feb;104(2):237-9.">

	target="right" >Natadisastra et al., 1988</a>). </span>

Filter paper is 
used to collect the cells and then they are stained. Results have been inconsistent 
and dependent in part on the severity of the vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency state
and on which measures are used. Ocular infections may confound the 
interpretation

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1428495/"
	target="right" >Carlier et al., 1992</a>). </span>
	
Due to relatively low sensitivity and 
specificity, WHO recommends combining this test with other indicators of vitamin&nbsp;A 
status

monitoring and evaluating intervention programmes">
	(<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-NUT-96.10"
	target="right" >WHO, 1996</a>). </span>
	
Currently the method is not being used in human studies. 
<p></p>
Vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency still occurs in the world, but major strides have been made in 
the eradication of blindness through public health interventions, such as high dose 
capsule distri&shy;bution and food fortifi&shy;cation with vitamin&nbsp;A. The definition for 
vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency includes both clinical manifest&shy;ations-xero&shy;phthalmia, 
anemia, growth retardation, increased infectious morbidity and mortality-as well 
as the following func&shy;tional consequences: impaired iron mobilization, disturbed 
cellular differentiation, and depressed immune response

defi&shy;ciency. Examples include zinc

Vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency may occur secondary to some disease states, including cystic 
fibrosis, severe intestinal and liver diseases, and some severe defects in lipid 
absorption (e.g., cholestasis). In developed countries, the preva&shy;lence of frank 
nutritional defi&shy;ciency of vitamin&nbsp;A is low. In the U.S. National Health and 
Nutrition Exam&shy;ination Survey (NHANES III, 1988&#8209;1994), for example, the 
preva&shy;lence of low serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions (&lt;0.70&micro;mol/L) was less than 2% 
in all age, sex, race or ethnic strata

<h3>18a.1.3 Food sources and dietary intakes</h3>

Pre&shy;formed vitamin&nbsp;A is found only in foods of animal origin: fish-liver oils, liver, 
butterfat, and egg yolk are the major dietary sources. Muscle meats are poor 
sources of pre&shy;formed vitamin&nbsp;A. Plant sources, such as nuts, grains, and vege&shy;table 
oils, have no pre&shy;formed vitamin&nbsp;A.
<p></p>
Pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A carot&shy;enoids are found in both plant 
and animal products.  In low-income countries the main food sources
are yellow and orange-colored fruits 

<span data-tippy-content="West CE. Meeting requirements for vitamin A.

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11140905/"
	target="right" >West, 2000</a>) </span>
	
and dark-green leafy vege&shy;tables. Red palm oil, and certain 
indigenous plants such as palm fruits (buriti) in Latin America, and the fruit termed 
"gac" in Vietnam, are unusually rich sources of pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A carot&shy;enoids 

<span data-tippy-content="FAO/WHO Human vitamin and mineral requirements. 2002 ">

	target="right" >FAO/WHO, 2002</a>). </span>
	
<p></p>
Pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A carot&shy;enoids, when derived from ripe yellow- and orange-colored 
fruits and cooked yellow tubers (e.g., sweet potatoes), appear to be more efficiently 
converted to retinol than when derived from dark green leafy vege&shy;tables

In more affluent countries such as Canada, the United States, and the United 
Kingdom, the major sources of pre&shy;formed vitamin&nbsp;A in the diet are liver, milk, and 
milk products, followed by fish in the United States and Canada

Of the pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A 
carot&shy;enoids, &beta;&#8209;carotene followed by  &beta;&#8209;crypto&shy;xanthin 
are the most impor&shy;tant. Other 
carot&shy;enoids important in the human diet
include &alpha;&#8209;carotene, lutein, lycopene, and 
zeaxanthin. 
<p></p>
Currently two conversion factors are used for calculating the amount of vitamin&nbsp;A 
activity in foods from pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A carot&shy;enoids, although the values applied differ 
across agencies.  FAO/WHO 

<span data-tippy-content="FAO/WHO Human vitamin and mineral requirements. 2002 ">
	(<a href="https://agris.fao.org/search/en/providers/122621/records/64776167f2e6fe92b36784cd"

still maintain the use of 1&micro;g retinol equals 
6&micro;g of  &beta;&#8209;carotene and 12&micro;g of 
other pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A carot&shy;enoids (mainly &alpha;&#8209;carotene 
and &beta;&#8209;crypto&shy;xanthin). These same carotenoid / equivalency ratios have also 
been adopted by the European Food Safety Authority

<span data-tippy-content="European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 2017,
Dietary Reference Values for nutrients Summary report">
	(<a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/e15121"
	target="right" >EFSA, 2017</a>). </span>
	
Furthermore, 
these two agencies express the substances with vitamin&nbsp;A activity as retinol 
equivalents (RE), whether they are pre&shy;formed vitamin&nbsp;A (mainly retinol and retinyl 
esters) in foods of animal origin or pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A carot&shy;enoids.
<p></p>
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board, however, concluded that the bio&shy;avail&shy;ability of 
pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A &beta;&#8209;carotene from plant sources 
is 12&micro;g to 1&micro;g retinol and 24&micro;g to 
1&micro;g for other pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A carot&shy;enoids for healthy individuals. For a detailed 
justification of these conversion factors, see IOM 

<span data-tippy-content="IOM, 2001, Dietary Reference Intakes for 
Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, 
Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc">
	(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222310/"
	target="right" >2001</a>). </span>
	
The U.S has also adopted 
the term retinol activity equivalents (RAE) for use when calculating the total 
amount of vitamin&nbsp;A in mixed dishes or diets. If the IOM 

<span data-tippy-content="IOM, 2001, Dietary Reference Intakes for 
Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, 
Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc">
	(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222310/"
	target="right" >2001</a>) </span>
	
conversion 
factors are adopted, the vitamin&nbsp;A activity in a foodstuff, expressed as a retinol 
activity equivalency, can be calculated from the following equation:

\[\small\mbox{RAE (&micro;g) = retinol (&micro;g) + (&beta;&#8209;carotene (&micro;g)/12.0)}\]
\[\small\mbox{+ (other pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A carot&shy;enoids (&micro;g)/24.0)}\]

Such inconsistencies in the specific carot&shy;enoids/retinol equivalency ratios applied 
exacerbate problems when comparing vitamin&nbsp;A values among food compo&shy;sition 
databases and, in turn, vitamin&nbsp;A intakes across countries. For example, vitamin&nbsp;A 
intakes calculated from some food compo&shy;sition data may be higher if the 
lower biocon&shy;version factors for pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A carot&shy;enoids recommended by 
FAO/WHO and EFSA were used, rather than the higher biocon&shy;version 
facturs adopted by the United States

	target="right" >IOM, 2001</a>). </span>

<p></p>
Some older food compo&shy;sition tables continue to express vitamin&nbsp;A in terms of 
international units (IU). Use of these older units is no longer appropriate for 
assessing dietary adequacy of vitamin&nbsp;A and should be discontinued

<h3>18a.1.4 Effects of high intakes</h3>

Suggestions that vitamin&nbsp;A and its carotenoid precursors are cancer-preventive 
agents led to increased consumption of large doses of vitamin&nbsp;A. This is a serious 
health hazard, partic&shy;ularly during pregnancy: hyper&shy;vitamin&shy;osis&nbsp;A has been 
asso&shy;ci&shy;ated with birth defects

<h2>18a.2 Indices of vitamin&nbsp;A status</h2>

Most of the vitamin&nbsp;A in the body is stored in the form of retinyl ester in the liver. 
Therefore, a measure of liver vitamin&nbsp;A stores is the best index of vitamin&nbsp;A status. 
The definition of vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency is when liver stores of retinol are below 
0.1&micro;mol/g 

<span data-tippy-content="Tanumihardjo SA. Biological evidence to 
define a vitamin A deficiency cutoff using total liver vitamin A reserves.

Vitamin&nbsp;A is not uniformly distributed in the liver 

<span data-tippy-content="Olson JA, Gunning D, Tilton R. The distri&shy;bution of vitamin A in

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/506974/"

Furthermore, liver biopsies are impractical in popu&shy;la&shy;tion 
studies. Instead, serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions are often deter&shy;mined. However, the 
serum or plasma contains only about 1% of the total body reserve of vitamin&nbsp;A, 
and concen&shy;tra&shy;tions do not reflect body stores until they are severely depleted. 
Consequently, it is best to use other bio&shy;chem&shy;ical and physio&shy;logical func&shy;tional tests 
of vitamin&nbsp;A status in combination with serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions. The most 
used biomarkers of vitamin&nbsp;A status are shown in Figure 18a.2.  Details of 
tests currently used are summar&shy;ized in a review article

<h3>18a.2.1 Serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions</h3>

Vitamin&nbsp;A in the plasma circulates largely in a 1:1 complex of retinol and 
retinol-binding protein (RBP). The remainder is in the form of retinyl ester and very small 
amounts of retinoic acid and other metabolites

<span data-tippy-content="Olson JA. Serum levels of vitamin A and carotenoids as 
reflectors of nutritional status. J Natl Cancer Inst. 1984 Dec;73(6):1439-44. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6439934/"
	target="right" >Olson, 1984</a>). </span>
	
Retinyl esters are 
elevated post-prandially after a meal containing pre&shy;formed or pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A. If 
retinyl esters are elevated in the fasted state, this is an indication of vitamin&nbsp;A 
toxicity 

<span data-tippy-content="Tanumihardjo SA, Russell RM, Stephensen CB, 
Gannon BM, Craft NE, Haskell MJ, Lietz G, Schulze K, Raiten DJ. Biomarkers of

Serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions are a common indicator for popu&shy;la&shy;tion studies; 
however, they only reflect vitamin&nbsp;A status when liver vitamin&nbsp;A stores are 
severely depleted or excessively high, in which case retinyl esters are also in 
circulation. When liver vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;tra&shy;tions are low or adequate, serum 
retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions are homeo&shy;statically controlled, and levels remain relatively 
constant and do not reflect total body reserves of vitamin&nbsp;A

<span data-tippy-content="Olson JA. Serum levels of vitamin A and carotenoids as 
reflectors of nutritional status. J Natl Cancer Inst. 1984 Dec;73(6):1439-44. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6439934/"
	target="right" >Olson, 1984</a>). </span>
	
Hence, 
it is not surprising that in popu&shy;la&shy;tions from developed countries, such as the United 
States, where the liver vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;tra&shy;tions are generally adequate, positive 
rela&shy;tion&shy;ships between serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions and usual intakes of vitamin&nbsp;A 
are rare

A cutoff for serum vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;tra&shy;tions of &lt;0.70&micro;mol/L is a less specific 
measure of vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency; its ability to predict a defi&shy;ciency of vitamin&nbsp; A
varies widely by region, probably depending on the presence and severity of other 
risk factors such as infection. None&shy;the&shy;less, the World Health Organization has 
guidance on the use of this cutoff 

<span data-tippy-content="WHO, 2011   Guideline: supplementation in infants and children

For example, in Sri Lanka, serum 
vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;tra&shy;tions &lt;0.70&micro;mol/L were found in only 28% of children 
(n=29) with clinical signs of vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency (Bitot's spots, corneal scars, or 
blindness) and in 5% of the children without positive eye findings

In Indonesia, 85% of children &lt;6y (n=325) with either night blindness or

In contrast, 28% of the children with eye findings and 48% of the children 
without eye findings had serum vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;tra&shy;tions >1.05&micro;mol/L. 
Additional tests may therefore be required to confirm vitamin&nbsp;A depletion at the 
individual level when a cutoff of &lt;0.70&micro;mol/L is used. At a popu&shy;la&shy;tion level, 
however, a cutoff of &lt;0.70&micro;mol/L can be used to indicate whether vitamin&nbsp;A 
defi&shy;ciency is likely to be a public health problem

<b>Disease</b>  may significantly alter serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions. Chronic renal disease 
increases serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions by reducing catabolism of vitamin&nbsp;A and its 
carriers. In contrast, liver disease decreases serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions, probably 
as a result of a combination of decreased synthesis and secretion of RBP. Cystic 
fibrosis is also asso&shy;ci&shy;ated with decreased levels of circulating retinol and RBP, 
probably because of a defect in the transport of vitamin&nbsp;A from the hepatic stores 
to the periphery.

Infections may 
also cause low serum retinol as a result of transient decreases in the concen&shy;tra&shy;tions 
of acute phase proteins, RBP, and transthyretin, even in the presence of adequate 
liver vitamin&nbsp;A stores. In NHANES III, inflammation, indicated by a serum

Special precautions must be taken in the preparation and storage of serum samples 
for vitamin&nbsp;A. Serum should be centrifuged soon after the blood is drawn, where 
possible, and hemolysis and exposure to bright light should be avoided. If 
separation is not possible within a short time, then the blood sample should 
be stored in an icebox with ice

frozen in temper&shy;ature resistant tubes, and then flushed with argon or oxygen-free 
nitrogen. The tubes should be closed tightly with a screw top, and only a small gas

Blood should be collected from a fingerprick onto filter paper 
(Schleicher and Schuell 903 specimen collection paper), dried for 3h in the dark, 
and stored with a desiccant in the dark in bags and at room temper&shy;ature (i.e., up to 
25&deg;C) before analysis. Storage under humid conditions causes loss of retinol in 
DBS and should be avoided.
<p></p>
Extraction of the DBS retinol can be followed by analysis using normal-phase 
HPLC with a highly sensitive detector. To reduce the variability of the method, it 
is recommended that the individual volume of the spots be considered by 
measuring their sodium content by flame photometry or by weighing the blood 
spots before extraction. The method has been used on blood spot samples from 
India, Nepal, Nicaragua, Indonesia, and Guatemala.

<h3>18a.2.2 Serum retinol-binding protein</h3>
<p></p>
Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is a specific vitamin&nbsp;A transport protein. It is called 
holo&#8209;RBP when it is bound to retinol; the portion without retinol is called apo&#8209;RBP. If the liver becomes depleted in retinol, as occurs in the late stages of vitamin&nbsp;A 
defi&shy;ciency, RBP accumulates in the liver as apo&#8209;RBP, and levels of both serum 
retinol and RBP decline.
<p></p>
Retinol-binding protein has a single high affinity binding site for a molecule of 
retinol. The resultant complex of RBP &plussim; retinol, together with one molecule of 
plasma transthyretin, form a trimolecular complex. Thus, the molar ratio of retinol 
to RBP in circulation is about one to one. Concen&shy;tra&shy;tions of serum RBP may thus 
be used as a surrogate measure for serum retinol. The assay of RBP is partic&shy;ularly 
useful in popu&shy;la&shy;tions where resources and technical support are limited: sample 
collection and the analytical procedures are easier and cheaper than for serum 
retinol, and the analysis can be performed on serum from a fingerprick blood 
sample.
<p></p>
Several studies have confirmed the positive corre&shy;lation of serum retinol and serum 
RBP

serum RBP (r=0.94) across all retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions. Severe vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency 
(serum retinol &lt;0.35&micro;mol/L) was predicted with 96% sensitivity and 91%

vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency (serum retinol &lt;0.70&micro;mol/L) with 87% sensitivity and 98%

retinol in this popu&shy;la&shy;tion. Similar findings were noted for pregnant women in

Nevertheless, a variety of factors may influence the binding of RBP to retinol. 
These include the presence and magnitude of the acute-phase response, 
protein-energy malnu&shy;tri&shy;tion, liver disease, 
and chronic renal failure. To overcome these 
confounding effects, use of the ratio of serum RBP: transthyretin (TTR) has been 
proposed

Transthyretin is 
unaffected by vitamin&nbsp;A status but, like RBP and serum retinol, decreases in 
infection and trauma. Hence, theoret&shy;ically, the ratio of RBP:TTR should decline 
during vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency but not during an acute-phase response, thus enabling 
these two conditions to be distinguished. Indeed, Rosales et al.

suggest that 
a cutoff value of 0.36 for RBP:TTR is indicative of marginal vitamin&nbsp;A 
defi&shy;ciency. However, use of this ratio has been questioned

<p></p>
<b>Interpretive criteria for RBP</b>

More research on the 
rela&shy;tion&shy;ship of serum RBP and serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions in popu&shy;la&shy;tions with a 
range of serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions is required before such a cutoff can be 
defined and is likely dependent on the kit or method used to evaluate RBP. In the 
interim, investigators are advised to first establish the rela&shy;tion&shy;ship between serum 
retinol and serum RBP in a subsample of the popu&shy;la&shy;tion under study by HPLC 
before using serum RBP as a surrogate for serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions. This is 
especially impor&shy;tant during pregnancy, when both the transport and the 
metabolism of RBP are altered

<b>Mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of RBP</b>

The RBP assay can be performed using a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay 
procedure in which the RBP is bound to radioactively labeled antibodies. This 
method has a lower limit of detection of 0.5nmol/L

<h3>18a.2.3 Serum retinyl ester </h3>
<p></p>
In normal healthy people, retinyl esters constitute less than 5% of the total vitamin&nbsp;A 
content in fasting serum samples. However, when the capacity of the liver to 
store vitamin&nbsp;A is exceeded &mdash; for example, after the chronic ingestion of excessive 
amounts of vitamin&nbsp;A (hyper&shy;vitamin&shy;osis&nbsp;A), 
or in liver disease &mdash; vitamin&nbsp;A is 
released into the circulation as retinyl esters, and then elevated concen&shy;tra&shy;tions of 
serum retinyl esters are observed. For example, in three patients with 
hyper&shy;vitamin&shy;osis&nbsp;A, retinyl esters made up 67%, 65%, and 33% of the total 
vitamin&nbsp;A present in the plasma

be performed using HPLC. The low levels in fasting serum can be measured

<h3>18a.2.4 Serum carot&shy;enoids</h3>

Approximately 50 carot&shy;enoids show pro&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;A activity and provide about 50% 
of the total vitamin&nbsp;A intake in the United States, as well as larger percentages in 
Asia, Africa, and parts of South America. In those countries where dietary 
carot&shy;enoids from plants are the major source of vitamin&nbsp;A and where dietary 
patterns are relatively constant, serum carot&shy;enoids may serve as a useful secondary 
index of vitamin&nbsp;A intake. For popu&shy;la&shy;tions receiving most of their vitamin&nbsp;A from 
animal sources, serum carotenoid concen&shy;tra&shy;tions provide no inform&shy;ation on

<h3>18a.2.5 Breast milk retinol</h3>

Breast milk retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions can indicate when the maternal vitamin&nbsp;A intake 
is sub&shy;optimal, because lactating women will secrete breast milk with a reduced 
content of retinol. This usually reflects inade&shy;quacies in both maternal dietary 
intake and body stores of vitamin&nbsp;A. Breast milk retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions can also be 
used as an indirect indicator of the vitamin&nbsp;A status of breastfed infants 

<span data-tippy-content="Stoltzfus RJ, Underwood BA. Breast-milk vitamin A as an indicator of the 
vitamin A status of women and infants. Bull World Health Organ. 1995;73(5):703-11.">

<p></p>
Most of the vitamin&nbsp;A in breast milk is in the form of retinyl palmitate in the milk 
fat. Concen&shy;tra&shy;tions are very high in colostrum and transitional breast milk (days 
7&#8209;21 postpartum). After about day 21, the concen&shy;tra&shy;tion stabilizes, so that breast milk 
samples taken after the first month postpartum are the most useful. The 
concen&shy;tra&shy;tion of retinol in breast milk varies over the course of a feed: the lowest 
concen&shy;tra&shy;tion is in the first milk expressed from a full breast because the fat 
content is highest at the end of a feed. Hence, preferably all the milk from a full 
breast that has not been used to feed an infant for at least 2h should be collected.

In practice, collecting the entire contents of one breast is difficult to achieve. 
Instead, a standardized collection procedure can be used to assess vitamin&nbsp;A status 
at the individual level. This involves collecting a small sample of breast milk (8&#8209;10mL) 
from a full breast before the infant starts suckling, either by manual 
self-expression or by using a breast pump

For popu&shy;la&shy;tion assess&shy;ment, casual breast milk samples can be taken randomly 
through&shy;out the day and at varying times after the infants were last fed. This will 
ensure that the variation in milk fat is randomly sampled. However, if random 
sampling is not possible, then the breast milk retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions can be 
expressed in terms of the fat content <a href="#table18a.3">(Table&nbsp;18a.3)</a>,

There are two circumstances when it may be preferable to express breast milk 
retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions per unit volume rather than per gram of fat. First, when a 
field survey includes mothers with a wide range in the stage of lactation, there will 
be a large standard deviation around the mean retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions because of the 
marked variation in milk retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tion from early to late lactation. This 
large variation may be masked by expressing the retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tion in terms of 
fat content. Secondly, in studies in which both the  &beta;&#8209;carotene and the fat content of 
breast milk are increased because of a vitamin&nbsp;A inter&shy;vention, retinol 
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions expressed per unit volume will provide a better measure of the 
response than when expressed in terms of the fat content

<b>Mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of breast milk retinol</b>
<p></p>
After collecting breast milk samples, they must be placed imme&shy;di&shy;ately in an 
insu&shy;lated ice box for transport from the field to the base laboratory. If the analysis 
cannot be completed imme&shy;di&shy;ately, samples may be frozen below &minus;20&deg;C. Care must 
be taken to ensure that the thawed samples are thoroughly mixed before aliquots 
are removed for analysis into amber or yellow poly&shy;propy&shy;lene tubes with airtight 
caps. Analysis of retinol in breast milk can be performed by HPLC, after 
saponifying the breast milk samples. The fat content of breast milk can be 
deter&shy;mined in the field by using the creamatocrit method. This involves collecting 
a sample (about 75&micro;L) of well&#8209;mixed breast milk into a hematocrit capillary tube, 
which is then sealed at one end. The tubes are spun in a hematocrit centrifuge, after 
which the length of the cream layer is measured. The amount of fat is deter&shy;mined 
by comparison with a standard curve of fat concen&shy;tra&shy;tions compiled using a 
standard lipid assay

<h3>18a.2.6 Relative dose response</h3>

The relative dose response (RDR) test can be used to estimate the liver stores of 
vitamin&nbsp;A and thereby identify individuals with marginal vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency. 
The test is based on the observation that during vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency, when liver 
stores are diminished, RBP accumulates in the liver as apo&#8209;RBP. Following the 
admin&shy;istra&shy;tion of a test dose of vitamin&nbsp;A, some of the vitamin&nbsp;A binds to the 
excess apo&#8209;RBP in the liver. It is then released as holo&#8209;RBP (i.e., RBP bound to 
retinol) into the circulation

Consequently, in vitamin&nbsp;A-
depleted individuals, there is a rapid and sustained increase in serum retinol after a 
small oral dose of vitamin&nbsp;A, whereas in individuals with normal liver vitamin&nbsp;A 
stores, this rise in serum retinol is either very small or does not occur.
<p></p>
The validity of the RDR test as an index of body stores of vitamin&nbsp;A has been 
studied by comparing vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;tra&shy;tions in liver biopsy samples with 
corresponding RDR test results for otherwise healthy surgical patients

After sup&shy;plement&shy;ation with vitamin&nbsp;A, 
all the elevated RDR values reverted to normal. These results indicate that the 
RDR is a more sensitive index of marginal vitamin&nbsp;A status than using serum 
vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;tra&shy;tions &lt;0.70&micro;mol/L, but it does not distinguish among 
different levels of adequate vitamin&nbsp;A reserves

<b>Interpretive criteria for the RDR test</b>
<p></p>
Vitamin&nbsp;A-replete subjects have RDR values ranging from zero to 14%. Relative 
dose response values >20% are generally considered indicative of inadequate 
hepatic stores of vitamin&nbsp;A and marginal vitamin&nbsp;A status

<span data-tippy-content="WHO, 1996  Indicators for assessing vitamin A deficiency and their application in

When >20% to &lt;30% of the sample popu&shy;la&shy;tion show abnormal RDR values (i.e., >20%), 
then a public health problem of moderate importance may be assumed. When the 
preva&shy;lence is >30%, the public health problem is severe

A systematic review and meta-analysis revealed 68% sensitivity and 85% specificity 
for the RDR test using total liver reserves of 0.10&micro;mol retinol/g as the reference 
standard for definition of vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency (Figure 18a.5)

<p></p>
<b>Mea&shy;sure&shy;ment of relative dose response</b>
<p></p>
Two blood samples are needed for the RDR test. A baseline fasting blood sample 
is taken imme&shy;di&shy;ately before the admin&shy;istra&shy;tion of a small oral dose (450 to 
1000&micro;g) of vitamin&nbsp;A (as retinyl acetate or retinol palmitate). 
Next, a high&#8209;fat snack that 
contains minimal vitamin&nbsp;A is consumed to ensure absorption of vitamin&nbsp;A. The 
second blood sample is taken 5h later. The RDR (%) is calculated as:

\[\small \frac {\mbox{plas. retinol (5h) &minus; plas. retinol (0h) &times; 
	100%}}{{\mbox{plas. retinol (5h)}}}\]

Concen&shy;tra&shy;tions of serum retinol for the RDR test should be measured 
by reverse-phase HPLC because this method has the 
required precision at low concen&shy;tra&shy;tions. 
Even a small analytical error can alter the RDR value significantly, especially 
when serum retinol concen&shy;tra&shy;tions are low.  

<h3>18a.2.7 Modified relative dose response</h3>

The modified relative dose response (MRDR) test requires only one blood sample, 
avoiding the necessity of taking a baseline sample. This modified test has been 
used to assess the vitamin&nbsp;A status in children and in pregnant and lactating 
women

For the test, a small oral dose of vitamin&nbsp;A2 is administered, usually 
3,4&#8209;di&shy;dehydro&shy;retinyl acetate (DRA). 
This is followed by a high-fat, low-vitamin&nbsp;A 
snack to facilitate the absorption of the DRA. The latter combines with the RBP in 
the same way as retinol but, unlike retinol, is not normally found in human plasma 
except when high levels of freshwater fish are consumed. The DRA is hydrolyzed 
in the gastrointestinal tract to 3,4&#8209;di&shy;dehydro&shy;retinol (DR), absorbed, and 
reesterified, mainly with palmitic acid in the intestinal mucosal cells

The acceptable time between administering the oral DRA dose and obtaining a single 
blood sample (about 0.5&#8209;2ml) is 4&#8209;7h. To enhance the stability of the DRA dose, 
it should be dissolved in corn oil and stored in amber vials inside a cooler on ice in 
the field, or at &minus;20&deg;C to &minus;70&deg;C for long&#8209;term storage. The blood sample should also 
be stored on ice in a light-protected cooler after collection, prior to separation of 
the serum. Analyses of DR and retinol (R) concen&shy;tra&shy;tions in the serum should be 
performed by HPLC. The molar ratio of [DR]:[R] (sometimes reported as A2/A1) 
is then calculated.

<h3>18a.2.8 Subjective assess&shy;ment of night blindness</h3>

Night blindness, or the inability to see after dusk or at night, has been reported 
among young children and women of reproductive age in developing countries 
with moderate to severe vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency

It is the most common ocular manifestation of vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency and is 
often described by specific terms in countries or cultures where the preva&shy;lence is 
high. For example, in some cultures it is known as "chicken eyes" or "chicken 
blindness"

Poor dark adaptation resulting in night blindness 
arises when there is reduced production in the rods of the visual pigment 
rhodopsin, or opsin protein bound to the retinal form of vitamin&nbsp;A.
<p></p>
To assess the preva&shy;lence of night blindness, the local term for night blindness must 
first be identified through focus group discussion 

<span data-tippy-content="Dawson S, Manderson L, Tallo VS. (1993).  A Manual for the

	(<a href="https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/41795"
	target="right" >Dawson et al., 1993</a>), </span>
	
and its reliability field tested. Next, a night blindness history is elicited via interviews. 
Care should always be taken during this stage to exclude those individuals whose 
night blindness results from other causes, such as the rare hereditary eye disease 
retinitis pigmentosa.

Some studies of children >2y have been based on interviews to elicit any history

freely after dusk and bump into objects. In studies of children >2y, WHO

reported 
that 85% of Indonesian preschool children with reported night blindness had low 
serum vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;tra&shy;tions (i.e., &lt;0.70&micro;mol/L). This strong association 
between night blindness and serum retinol levels is shown in 

<a href="#table18a.5">Table&nbsp;18a.5</a>.	

This also shows similar positive findings for a second clinical sign of vitamin&nbsp;A 
defi&shy;ciency &mdash; Bitot's spots with conjunctival xerosis.
<p></p>
Determination of the preva&shy;lence of night blindness is recommended as a tool to 
assess vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency in women of reproductive age. When using maternal 
night blindness in this way, only women with a previous pregnancy that ended in a 
live birth in the past 3y should be included

A recommended cutoff at which vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency is considered a significant 
public health problem within a community is when the preva&shy;lence of maternal 
night blindness is 5% or greater

<span data-tippy-content="Christian P. Recommendations for indicators:

This cutoff value takes into

who report problems with daytime vision (i.e., daytime blindness). Efforts should

due to daytime blindness. WHO

together with minimum sample sizes required. However, the large minimum 
sample sizes required together with the increasing use of vitamin&nbsp;A supple&shy;ments 
among young children in most developing countries preclude the use of these 
WHO cutoffs for children. Instead, in most low&#8209;income countries, the assess&shy;ment 
of nightblindness in women of reproductive age is probably more useful.

<h3>18a.2.9 Rapid dark adaptation test</h3>

Before night blindness develops, disturbances in dark adaptation occur. These can 
be detected by specially designed noninvasive tests

The conventional laboratory-based, formal dark adaptometry test is a tedious and time-
consuming procedure. Instead, a rapid dark adaptation test (RDAT), suitable for 
field conditions, has been developed. This is based on the mea&shy;sure&shy;ments of the 
timing of the Purkinje shift 

<span data-tippy-content="Thornton SP. A rapid test for dark adaptation. 
Ann Ophthalmol. 1977 Jun;9(6):731-4. ">

in which the peak wavelength 
sensitivity of the retina shifts from the red toward the blue end of the visual 
spectrum during the transition from photopic or cone&#8209;mediated day vision to 
scotopic or rod&#8209;mediated night vision. This shift causes the intensity of blue light 
to appear brighter than that of red light under scotopic lighting conditions.
<p></p>
The RDAT requires a light&#8209;proof room, a light source, a dark, nonreflective work 
surface, a standard X&#8209;ray view box, and sets of red, blue, and white discs; details 
are given in Vinton and Russell 

<span data-tippy-content="Vinton NE, Russell RM. Evaluation of a rapid test of dark adaptation.

	target="right" >1981</a>). </span>
	
<p></p>
Mea&shy;sure&shy;ments for the RDAT are undertaken during the first few minutes of dark 
adaptation. This is a disadvantage because the mea&shy;sure&shy;ments rely mainly on the 
cones or light vision cells in the retina instead of the rods or dark vision cones. As 
a result, the test is not very sensitive to the early signs of vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency

An additional disadvantage is that the 
RDAT is not appropriate for preschool children, who are too young to perform the 
test accurately. This is unfortunate because preschool children are the group most 
at risk for vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency. False positives may also occur and between 
examiner variability may produce inconsistencies in the results.
<p></p>
Age influences dark adaptation and hence must be taken into account when 
determining the normal range of the rapid test adaptation times for healthy 
reference popu&shy;la&shy;tions

<h3>18a.2.10 Pupillary and visual threshold test</h3>

A scotopic (dim light vision) device has been developed to assess the 
responsiveness and sensitivity of the pupil to light as an indication of an 
individual's dark adaptation threshold. The test measures the threshold of light at 
which pupillary contraction occurs under dark-adapted conditions 

<span data-tippy-content="Congdon N, Sommer A, Severns M, Humphrey J, Friedman D, Clement L,

A portable field dark adaptometer was developed that includes a digital 
camera, retinal bleaching flash, and Ganzfeld light source housed within a pair of 
light-obscuring goggles

Pupillary response mea&shy;sure&shy;ments may be more affordable for countries wishing to use this device.
<p></p>
Unlike the RDAT, the pupillary and visual threshold test can be conducted in the 
field on individuals of all ages, including preschool children, who cannot be tested 
by the RDAT. The test requires minimal cooperation from the subjects and takes 
about 20 min per subject. A darkened facility is required for this test. A portable 
tent has been developed and tests devised to ensure that the darkness in the testing 
area is adequate

The apparatus consists of two handheld 
illuminators, each having a yellow-green, light-emitting diode light source 
(dominant wavelength = 572nm) with 12 intensity settings. Each illuminator is 
designed to fit entirely over one eye and to illuminate the entire retina. One of the 
illuminators is designed to measure light of "low intensity" (illumination range: 
8.75 to &#8209;3.00 log cd/m<sup>2</sup>) and the 
other "high intensity" (illumination range &#8209;4.16 
to 0.44 log cd/m<sup>2</sup>).
<p></p>
Before testing, participants are subjected to a camera-flash "partial bleach" of the 
full retina, which involves placing the subjects in a dark room and exposing them 
to a camera flash reflected through a foil-lined cone, after which they are allowed 
10 min of dark adaptation. The visual threshold is measured first by placing the 
low&#8209;intensity illuminator over the subject's left eye. The light intensity is then 
incremented over 11 intensity settings (roughly a 4&#8209;log unit range) at 10s intervals 
until a pupillary response (i.e., quick contraction of the pupil on presenting the 
stimulus) is seen in the uncovered right eye on two successive trials. The 
uncovered right eye is observed with an obliquely mounted red LED light source 
(dominant wavelength = 626nm), which preserves dark adaptation in both the 
subjects and the observer. Next, the pupillary threshold is measured, as described 
above, using the high intensity illuminator; further details are given in Congdon et 
al.

The stimulus for the visual or the pupillary threshold is defined as the lowest level 
at which the subject can correctly distinguish stimulus from non-stimulus on three 
successive trials. High pupillary and visual scores reflect a pupillary response 
achieved at a greater light intensity, and indicate poorer dark adaptability

Additional studies are needed to establish whether testing for both pupillary and 
visual thresholds is necessary, because the latter requires less training and 
standardization of personnel. In some studies on young children aged 1 to 2y, only 
pupillary testing has been performed because complete visual testing on such 
young children is not always possible

Significant improvements in dark adaptation as assessed by visual and/or pupillary

Nevertheless, there are limitations associated with the pupillary and visual 
threshold tests. For example, some investigators have shown overlapping values 
for deficient and nondeficient popu&shy;la&shy;tion groups, so that scotopic threshold testing 
may be more suitable for popu&shy;la&shy;tion assess&shy;ment than for individuals. Further, the 
time required to administer the test is about 20 min per subject, so it is probably 
not feasible to test large numbers of individuals. Sanchez et al.

suggest that 
for popu&shy;la&shy;tions at high risk for vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency, 
as few as six subjects may be 
sufficient to show that the group mean thresholds differ significantly from normal. 
In popu&shy;la&shy;tions with mild vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency, testing about 100 subjects is 
probably adequate

<p></p>
Another limitation is that recovery of the normal pupillary response after dosing 
with vitamin&nbsp;A supple&shy;ments takes about 4&#8209;6wk. One must wait at least this long 
before retesting treated individuals. Finally, the period required to train examiners 
to recognize the pupillary response is 1&#8209;3d.
<p></p>
Two cutoff values were proposed to indicate whether vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency is a 
problem or not in an area, based on a mean pupillary dark adaptation score for a 
popu&shy;la&shy;tion. Scores worse than the cutoff of &minus;1.11 log&nbsp;cd/m<sup>2</sup> are said to indicate 
vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency, whereas scores better than the 
normal cutoff of &minus;1.24 log&nbsp;cd/m<sup>2</sup> should indicate that a popu&shy;la&shy;tion is normal, or that an intervention has 
successfully improved vitamin&nbsp;A status

The popu&shy;la&shy;tion mean should be calculated for this test, rather than the proportion 
falling below a specific value, as has been stipulated for the other tests of vitamin&nbsp;A 
nutriture. This approach is recommended because in popu&shy;la&shy;tions with marginal 
vitamin&nbsp;A status, the small proportion of subjects with abnormal values for the test 
could potentially markedly increase the sample size required for testing.

<h3>18a.2.12 Stable isotope methods and total body stores of vitamin&nbsp;A</h3>

Retinol isotope dilution (RID) tests are the only method that indirectly provide a 
quantitative measure of the hepatic stores of vitamin&nbsp;A. It involves the 
admin&shy;istra&shy;tion of an oral dose of isotopically labeled vitamin&nbsp;A. The dose is 
allowed to mix with the vitamin&nbsp;A pool in the body. A post-dose blood 
sample is taken, and the ratio of labeled to non-labeled vitamin&nbsp;A in serum is 
measured by mass spectrometry. The amount of total body stores of vitamin&nbsp;A is 
related to the extent of dilution of the labeled tracer and is calculated using 
prediction equations

suggest that 3d may suffice. A shorter

Therefore, a value that represents accurate vitamin A status is 
determined because actual hepatic reserves are estimated. 
While best used at the group level, vitamin&nbsp;A status can be viewed across the 
continuum, such as that represented in Figure 18a.2

<b>Hepatic liver reserves to define vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency and toxicity</b>
<p></p>
The criteria to define vitamin&nbsp;A defi&shy;ciency were evaluated in light of the Dietary 
Reference Intakes (DRIs) for North Americans

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33765844/"
	target="right" >Tanumihardjo, 2021 </a>). </span>
	
The criteria 
used to formulate DRIs were clinical eyes signs, circulating plasma retinol 
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions, bile excretion containing vitamin&nbsp;A metabolites, and long-term 
vitamin&nbsp;A storage. In consideration of DRI criteria, induced biliary excretion and 
long-term vitamin&nbsp;A storage do not occur until 
liver vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;tra&shy;tions are
&le;0.10&micro;mol/g

together with the corresponding cutoff values 
used in popu&shy;la&shy;tion assess&shy;ment. Some caution is needed when applying these 
cutoffs to individuals because of the influence of the many confounding factors. 
Table 18a.8 also provides inform&shy;ation on the popu&shy;la&shy;tion preva&shy;lence levels of each 
indicator for defining a mild, moderate, or severe public health problem in relation 
to vitamin&nbsp;A, although these prevalence values are currently being reevaluated
<p></p>
According to WHO 

<span data-tippy-content="WHO, 2011   Guideline: supplementation in infants and children
6–59 months of age">
	(<a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/44664/9789241501767_eng.pdf"
	target="right" >2011</a>), </span>
	
a public health problem exists when a popu&shy;la&shy;tion has at 
least two biological indicators with a preva&shy;lence above the level corresponding to a 
defi&shy;ciency, or one biological indicator of defi&shy;ciency supported by a composite of at 
least four demographic and ecological risk factors, two of which must be nutrition&#8209; and
diet-related. Details of these demographic and ecological risk factors are given 
in WHO

The selection of the most appropriate combination of criteria depends on the 
purpose of the study, the expected range of vitamin&nbsp;A status for the study group, 
and the resources available. WHO often uses mortality outcomes to define its 
guidance, especially for young children
