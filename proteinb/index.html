<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

The assessment of protein status in the human body is challenging 
because available bio&shy;markers lack specificity. Short-term inadequate
intakes lead to protein losses from the visceral protein pool,
quantified traditionally using visceral serum proteins, all of which
have a low sensitivity and specificity.  Additional protein bio&shy;markers
in serum or whole blood used may include serum insulin-like growth
factor&nbsp;1, consid&shy;ered more sensitive and specific than visceral serum
proteins, serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine, a potential bio&shy;marker of skeletal muscle
mass, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) used as a bio&shy;marker of protein
intake, espe&shy;cially in preterm infants.
<p></p>
In chronic protein deficiency, there is loss of skeletal muscle mass
which can be measured by technological methods in clinical settings such
as
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), ultra&shy;sound, and
bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).
Future studies may apply BIA&#8209;derived phase
angle in both com&shy;mu&shy;nity and clinical settings to detect reduced muscle
mass and strength (i.e., sarco&shy;penia) espe&shy;cially in the elderly.
Fat&#8209;free mass index, calculated by dividing fat&#8209;free mass by height
squared, may be used to assess muscle mass in patients with chronic
illnesses.  In resource poor settings, however, proxy measures of muscle
mass based on anthropometry such as 
mid-upper arm circum&shy;ference (MUAC), 
mid-upper arm muscle circum&shy;ference (MUAMC),
arm muscle area (AMA),
and calf circum&shy;ference are used.  In the past, urinary metabolites such as
crea&shy;ti&shy;nine, 3&#8209;hydroxy&shy;proline and 3&#8209;methylhistidine have also been used
as indicators of skeletal muscle mass with varying success.
<p></p>
Functional indices of protein status include changes in immuno&shy;logical
responses and muscle function, the latter through hand grip strength,
and more recently BIA&#8209;phase angle.  Preferably, a combination of
measure&shy;ments, based on selected serum bio&shy;markers, anthropometry, and
tests of skeletal muscle mass and function, should be used to assess
body protein status.

<h3>16b.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment of protein status </h3>
<p></p>
A comprehensive assessment of protein status requires 
dietary intake data, and selected anthro&shy;pometric and bio&shy;chem&shy;ical measures. 
In chronic protein deficiency, if facilities are available, 
technological methods such as dual-energy 
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), ultra&shy;sound, and bioelectrical impedance 
analysis (BIA) can also be used to quantify loss of skeletal muscle mass.
No single param&shy;eter is
suffi&shy;ciently reliable to assess protein nutri&shy;tional status.
<p></p>
Protein turnover is a contin&shy;uous process by which all body
proteins are broken down and resyn&shy;the&shy;sized.  The balance of break&shy;down
and synthesis reaches a steady state when there is no net gain or loss
of protein.  With inad&shy;equate protein intake and/or a diet limited in
indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids, the balance shifts towards tissue catabolism
to provide sufficient amino acids for endoge&shy;nous require&shy;ments.
Short-term inad&shy;equate intake leads to protein losses from the visceral
protein pool (i.e. serum proteins, erythro&shy;cytes, granulo&shy;cytes,
lym&shy;pho&shy;cytes, etc

Traditionally, the visceral
protein pool has been quantified through the measure&shy;ment of circulating
visceral serum proteins, details of which are outlined below.
<p></p>
In chronic protein deficiency, however, muscle proteins undergo
proteolysis to supply the necessary amino acids for enhanced protein
synthesis.  There&shy;fore, there is loss of both skeletal muscle mass and
muscle function

they vary in complexity, availability and cost and are also discussed
below.

<p></p>
Theoretically, visceral protein bio&shy;markers have three potential
roles, namely diagnosis of protein-energy malnu&shy;trition, monitoring of
therapeutic inter&shy;ven&shy;tions , and the provision of information on prognosis
(i.e., predicting outcome) on which to decide whether to intervene
therapeutically

<span data-tippy-content="Livingstone C. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and 
clinical nutrition. Clin Sci (Lond). 2013 Sep;125(6):265&#8209;80. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23721057/"
	target="right" >Livingstone, 2013</a>).</span>

To accomplish these roles, an
ideal bio&shy;marker should have the following characteristics listed in Box
16b.2 and summarised by Livingstone

<p></p>
<b>Features of an ideal protein-energy visceral protein
bio&shy;marker </b>
<p></p>
Unfortunately, none of the visceral protein bio&shy;markers listed in
Box&nbsp;16b.1 meet&nbsp;all the criteria listed in Box&nbsp;16b.2.  This has led to
controversy over their use, espe&shy;cially in clinical settings where acute
and chronic disease is common.  In such settings visceral serum proteins
act as negative-acute phase proteins, declining in response to
inflam&shy;mation due to the influence of cytokines, regardless of
malnu&shy;trition.  As it is not possible to separate the
influence of inflam&shy;mation from that of malnu&shy;trition, 
the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition has deemed the available 
visceral serum proteins of limited use for assessing 
protein-energy malnutrition. Instead, they emphasize that visceral serum proteins should
only be recog&shy;nized as inflam&shy;matory bio&shy;markers asso&shy;ciated with "nutrition
risk"

<span data-tippy-content="Evans DC, Corkins MR, Malone A, Miller S,

	target="right" >Evans et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>).</span>

<p></p>
The current consensus is that visceral serum proteins should
always be used alongside bio&shy;markers of inflam&shy;mation and as a complement
to other methods of nutri&shy;tional assess&shy;ment such as a nutrition-focused
physical examination

<span data-tippy-content="Bharadwaj S, Ginoya S, Tandon P, Gohel TD, 
Guirguis J, Vallabh H, Jevenn A, Hanouneh I. Malnutrition:

Several nutrition-focused physical examination assess&shy;ment tools are available for
diagnosing malnu&shy;trition in hospitalized patients.  See Keller

for more details.  Whether visceral serum proteins can be used to diagnose
protein-energy nutri&shy;tional status in the absence of inflam&shy;mation is the
subject of active investigation.
<p></p>
Currently, the bio&shy;marker most widely used to identify the
presence of inflam&shy;mation in both com&shy;mu&shy;nity and hospital settings is
serum C&#8209;reactive protein (CRP). It is a useful bio&shy;marker because it responds 
rapidly to changing clinical conditions, is widely available, and has high sensitivity

<span data-tippy-content="Evans DC, Corkins MR, Malone A, Miller S, 
Mogensen KM, Guenter P, Jensen GL; ASPEN Malnutrition

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33125793/"
	target="right" >Evans et&nbsp;al 2019</a>).</span>

Measuring CRP concurrently with visceral serum proteins allows for some 
differen&shy;tiation between the contribution of inflammation versus protein-energy 
malnutrition when interpreting decreased visceral serum protein levels

<span data-tippy-content="Bharadwaj S, Ginoya S, Tandon P, Gohel TD,

	target="right" >Bharadwaj et&nbsp;al., 2016</a>).</span>

The importance of adjusting for the confounding effects
of inflam&shy;mation on bio&shy;markers in low&#8209;income countries has led to a new
approach using regres&shy;sion correction to adjust for the confounding
effects of inflam&shy;mation termed the "BRINDA inflam&shy;mation adjust&shy;ment
method."  For the BRINDA method, CRP alone, alpha&#8209;1&#8209;acid glyco&shy;protein
(AGP) alone, or both AGP and CRP together can be used.  So far, the
BRINDA inflam&shy;mation adjust&shy;ment method has been applied only to
bio&shy;markers of micronutrient status (i.e., iron, zinc, and vitamin A).
However, in the future this method may be modified for use with visceral
serum proteins when used in settings where inflam&shy;mation co&#8209;exists.  For
details of a practical guide on applying the BRINDA adjust&shy;ment method,
see Luo et&nbsp;al.

<p></p>
All the serum visceral proteins are affected to varying degrees
by several other factors besides inflam&shy;mation, which together reduce
their specificity; these are summarized in Box&nbsp;16b.2 and discussed in
more detail below.

<h3>  16b.1.1  Total serum protein </h3>
<p></p>
This bio&shy;marker measures the total protein content in blood serum
and includes albumin and globulins.  It is easily measured and in the
past was used an index of visceral protein status in national nutrition
surveys, espe&shy;cially in low-income countries

However, it is now known to be a poor bio&shy;marker of protein status.  Many
factors influence total serum protein concen&shy;tra&shy;tions as shown in Box&nbsp;16b.2,
compromising their specificity and sensitivity.  An additional
factor often impacting on total serum protein levels in severely ill
hospital patients is the administration of blood products such as
albumin.  A recent system&shy;atic review and meta-analysis of older adults
found only a moderate associ&shy;ation between total serum protein levels and
risk of malnu&shy;trition in a non&#8209;acute population, defined by validated
nutrition assess&shy;ment tools, such as subjective global assess&shy;ment (SGA);
although other bio&shy;markers evaluated were said to be superior

<p></p>
<h3>  16b.1.2  Serum albumin </h3>
<p></p>
The primary protein in human serum is albumin (between 3&#8209;5g/kg
body weight) which has been used in the past as a bio&shy;marker of
protein nutri&shy;tional status.  However, serum albumin concen&shy;tra&shy;tions only
reflect changes within the intra&shy;vascular space and not the total
visceral protein pool.  As such, it is a poor nutri&shy;tional bio&shy;marker.
Albumin has a large pool size and a long half-life (14&#8209;20d) so it is
insensitive to short-term changes in protein status and thus not
appro&shy;priate for assessing acute changes in nutri&shy;tional status.
More&shy;over, in cases of both acute and chronic illness, serum albumin
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions may be main&shy;tained due to a compen&shy;satory reduc&shy;tion in
albumin catabolism.  For example, in the anorexia nervosa population,
normal or only slightly decreased serum albumin levels have been
observed, despite the presence of severe protein-energy malnu&shy;trition,
low muscle mass and reduced muscle strength

so in an inflam&shy;matory state
albumin leaks out of the intra&shy;vascular space resulting in a measurable
decrease in serum values

Even a well&#8209;nourished
person can develop hypo&shy;albuminemia (low albumin) within hours of a
traumatic injury or acute illness due to inflam&shy;mation and fluid shifts

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30288759/"
	target="right" >Soeters et al., 2019</a>). </span>

As albumin leaves the intra&shy;vascular
space, interstitial edema can develop which further dilutes measured
serum values.
<p></p>
Albumin also provides more than 50% of the antioxidant activity
in plasma

<span data-tippy-content="Taverna M, Marie AL, Mira JP, Guidet B. 
Specific antioxidant properties of human serum albumin.

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23414610/"
	target="right" >Taverna et al., 2013</a>)</span>

so it binds to pro&#8209;oxidative substances and
is rapidly degraded.  The half&#8209;life
of albumin may be shortened during an inflam&shy;matory period, further
contributing to reduced serum levels.  
<p></p>
The use of serum albumin
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions as a prognostic index for the devel&shy;op&shy;ment of
post&shy;operative compli&shy;cations has been extensively studied.  Adults
under&shy;going spinal surgery with pre&#8209;operative hypo&shy;albuminemia were
reported to experience an increase in post&shy;operative complications
(hospital length of stay, surgical site infec&shy;tions and readmission
rates)

Whether compli&shy;cations could be improved with
pre&#8209;operative nutri&shy;tional and/or medical inter&shy;ven&shy;tions is uncertain due
to the retro&shy;spec&shy;tive nature of these studies.  In many cases, however,
surgery was the only possible inter&shy;ven&shy;tion to improve the under&shy;lying
inflam&shy;matory processes.
<p></p>
Several other studies attempting to evaluate whether intense
nutri&shy;tional inter&shy;ven&shy;tions in acute or chronically ill patients with
hypo&shy;albuminemia improved low serum albumin levels and/or clinical
outcomes were unable to demonstrate any signif&shy;icant improvements.  The
2021 American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN)
position paper discourages the use of serum albumin as a proxy measure
of total body protein and as a bio&shy;marker of nutri&shy;tional status in
clinical settings

<b>Factors affecting serum albumin</b>
<p></p>
<b>Age</b> influences serum albumin, with concen&shy;tra&shy;tions rising
until the second or third decade of life and then declining thereafter,
possibly related to a reduc&shy;tion in the rate of albumin synthesis.  In a
2017 review and meta-analysis of malnu&shy;trition risk in older adults
(n=111), albumin levels &lt;35g/dL were asso&shy;ciated with reduced
nutri&shy;tional status.  However, the authors suggest that albumin was
insensitive as a screening bio&shy;marker in this population

occurring at age 25y

<b>Pregnancy</b> reduces serum albumin due in part to
hemodilution.
<p></p>
<b>Inflammation, infection, and metabolic stress</b> elicit the
acute phase response mediated by pro&#8209;inflam&shy;matory cytokines.  Albumin
is a negative acute phase reactant, so its production is decreased if
there is an active infection or inflam&shy;mation resulting in low serum
albumin concen&shy;tra&shy;tions

<b>Disease states</b> such as some gastro&shy;intestinal diseases
(e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and renal diseases are
asso&shy;ciated with decreased serum albumin concen&shy;tra&shy;tions (i.e.,
hypo&shy;albuminemia) due to an increase in albumin losses either via the
gastro&shy;intestinal tract or kidneys.  In liver disease, low serum albumin
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions arise from a reduc&shy;tion in protein synthesis, whereas in
hypo&shy;thyroidism and congestive heart failure, fluid retention and dilutional
effects contribute to reduced serum albumin levels.  Degradation of
albumin is also reduced in hypo&shy;thyroidism further contributing to
altered albumin levels
<p></p>
<b>Semi-starvation</b> is asso&shy;ciated with low albumin levels
(i.e., hypo&shy;albuminemia) due to a reduc&shy;tion in protein intake which in
turn reduces the ability of the liver to synthesize albumin.  In some
cases, however, fluid loss may occur leading to higher serum albumin
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions (hyper&shy;albuminemia).
<p></p>
<b>Dehydration</b> as may occur with severe diarrhea may result
in hyper&shy;albuminemia as a result of a diminished plasma volume.
<p></p>
<b>Blood trans&shy;fusions and parenteral administration of
albumin</b> may increase serum albumin, masking any changes in levels in
hospital patients, thus confounding its use.
<p></p>
<b>Interpretive criteria and measure&shy;ment of serum albumin</b>
<p></p>
Reference intervals are a statistically derived range of values
that encompass the central 95% of values from a healthy refer&shy;ence
population.  Values within this interval are assumed to represent a
normal range.  Bio&shy;marker test results lying outside of the refer&shy;ence
interval suggest an abnormal result.  For more discussion, see 
Chapter&nbsp;1:  Introduction; Section&nbsp;1.6  Evaluation of nutri&shy;tional assess&shy;ment
indices.  Unfortunately, depending on the bio&shy;marker, refer&shy;ence intervals
are not necessarily trans&shy;ferable between labora&shy;tories due to differ&shy;ences
in both the refer&shy;ence populations (e.g., ethnic compo&shy;sition, geographic
factors, habitual diets, lifestyles) and analytical methods used.
<p></p>
Several countries have established refer&shy;ence intervals for serum
albumin.  In the U.S, Ritchie et&nbsp;al.

Other methods include standard electro&shy;phoresis and

<h3>  16b.1.3  Serum pre&shy;albu&shy;min or transthyretin</h3>
<p></p>
Pre&#8209;albumin, historically known as trans&shy;thyretin, is a protein
synthesized in the liver which acts as a trans&shy;port protein for thyroid
hormones.  Prealbumin circulates bound to retinol&#8209;binding protein&nbsp;4 
(RBP&nbsp;4) and its retinol ligand.  Pre&#8209;albumin has a high indis&shy;pens&shy;able to
dispensable amino acid ratio

Synthesis of pre&shy;albu&shy;min decreases as the body nitrogen pools
decline following a reduc&shy;tion in protein intake, suggesting that
pre&shy;albu&shy;min may have potential as bio&shy;marker of protein nutritional
status.  Certainly in the rat model, pre&shy;albu&shy;min was noted to decrease
after 14 days on an intake of sixty percent dietary protein

The response of serum pre&shy;albu&shy;min to
dietary protein intake has also been investigated in human studies.  In
children with severe protein-energy malnu&shy;trition, for example,
pre&shy;albu&shy;min levels increased within 48 hours of protein supple&shy;mentation
and normalized within eight days of therapy

However, in these early
studies, the possible influence of inflam&shy;mation on the pre&shy;albu&shy;min
response was not consid&shy;ered.  In a later system&shy;atic review and
meta-analysis of blood bio&shy;markers asso&shy;ciated with risk of malnu&shy;trition
in older adults

a sensitivity analysis confirmed
that serum pre&shy;albu&shy;min concen&shy;tra&shy;tions were markedly reduced in response
to acute inflam&shy;matory stress.  In a later study of neonates in the
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), concen&shy;tra&shy;tions,of pre&shy;albu&shy;min were
also negatively correlated with CRP (&#8209;0.62; P&lt;0.005)

Hence, together these findings emphasize that
caution must be used when inter&shy;preting pre&shy;albu&shy;min concen&shy;tra&shy;tions in
acute health care settings.
<p></p>
The use of pre&shy;albu&shy;min as a nutri&shy;tional bio&shy;marker in
non-inflam&shy;matory states has also been investigated.  In a system&shy;atic
review of subjects with restrictive eating disorders but were otherwise
healthy with no evidence of inflam&shy;matory illness, those with severe
protein-energy malnu&shy;trition  had normal pre&shy;albu&shy;min concen&shy;tra&shy;tions that
did not decline until their Body Mass Index (BMI) was &lt;12.  Based on these findings, the
authors concluded that pre&shy;albu&shy;min concen&shy;tra&shy;tions cannot be used as
bio&shy;markers of protein nutri&shy;tional status or to identify the need for
nutrition support even in otherwise healthy subjects with no evidence of
inflam&shy;mation

<p></p>
Never&shy;theless, considerable controversy remains over the
usefulness of serum pre&shy;albu&shy;min as a bio&shy;marker of protein nutritional
status.  Investi&shy;gations on the use of pre&shy;albu&shy;min as a bio&shy;marker for
monitoring the efficacy of nutrition support in clinical nutrition
practice have been extensive, in part because of its short half&#8209;life
(i.e., 2&#8209;3d).  Results have been mixed.  Bernstein et&nbsp;al.  

<span data-tippy-content="Bernstein LH, Leukhardt-Fairfield CJ, Pleban W,

	target="right" >1989</a>)</span>

reported weekly increases in serum pre&shy;albu&shy;min of 40&#8209;50mg/L in response
to adequate nutri&shy;tional support.  They suggested that a response of less
than 20mg/L in a week is indicative of either inad&shy;equate nutritional
support or a failure to respond to the treatment.  Others have argued
that if inflam&shy;mation decreases during nutri&shy;tional support, pre&shy;albu&shy;min
will surely increase, so the part played by nutri&shy;tional care will be
difficult to distinguish

Indeed, the recent
ASPEN position paper on the use of visceral proteins as nutrition
bio&shy;markers concluded that normalization of pre&shy;albu&shy;min during nutrition
support could indicate several factors including the resolution of
inflam&shy;mation, the reduc&shy;tion of nutrition risk, a trans&shy;ition to
anabolism, and/or potentially lower calorie and protein require&shy;ments

In view of these uncertainties, authors of the
ASPEN publi&shy;cation discourage the use of pre&shy;albu&shy;min as a bio&shy;marker of
total body protein or total muscle mass.  They also conclude that
pre&shy;albu&shy;min is not useful for monitoring nutrition support, even for
indi&shy;vid&shy;uals with no evidence of inflam&shy;matory illness.
<p></p>
Never&shy;theless, the ASPEN recommendations remain open to debate.
Despite its recog&shy;nized limitations, according to Delliere & Cynober

<span data-tippy-content="Dellière S, Cynober L. Is transthyretin a good marker 
of nutri&shy;tional status? Clin Nutr. 2017 Apr;36(2):364&#8209;370.">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27381508/"

plasma pre&shy;albu&shy;min can be useful to diagnose malnu&shy;trition  and
its severity in those indi&shy;vid&shy;uals with no inflam&shy;mation syndrome.
Moreover, they also advocate pre&shy;albu&shy;min as a good bio&shy;marker for
monitoring the efficacy of the response to nutrition inter&shy;ven&shy;tions.  In
their review, they provide two algorithms, one to interpret pre&shy;albu&shy;min
levels in patients with a CRP concen&shy;tration indicative of
the absence of inflam&shy;mation (i.e.,&lt;15mg/L), and a second to interpret
levels in intensive care unit patients; see Delliere & Cynober

<b>Age and sex</b> influence serum pre&#8209;albumin.
Concen&shy;trations increase linearly from birth during
infant growth, plateauing in adulthood until the sixth decade,
after which concen&shy;tra&shy;tions decline.
At the onset of puberty, hormonal-induced sexual dimorphisms
occur with males having higher
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions than females which reach a plateau during full
sexual maturity. These sex&#8209;related
differ&shy;ences are main&shy;tained during adulthood, with concen&shy;tra&shy;tions
of 300&#8209;330mg/L in adult
males compared to 250&#8209;270mg/L in adult females.  From the sixth decade,
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions show a stepwise decrease, with sex&#8209;related differ&shy;ences
becoming less marked and no longer evident by the eighth decade

<b>Inflammation, infection, stress</b> elicit the acute phase
response resulting in a decrease in serum pre&shy;albu&shy;min concen&shy;tra&shy;tions.
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the observed decline,
including the existence of hepatic reprioritization of protein
synthesis, possibly increased tissue catabolism, and/or redistribution
of pre&shy;albu&shy;min because of an increase in capillary permeability

<b>Disease states</b> such as kidney disease degrade pre&shy;albu&shy;min
so with any renal dysfunction pre&shy;albu&shy;min levels are increased.
Conversely, pre&shy;albu&shy;min levels are decreased in liver disease, and
dialysis because the ability of the liver to synthesize proteins,
including pre&shy;albu&shy;min, is impaired.  Likewise, signif&shy;icant hyper&shy;glycemia
can decrease pre&shy;albu&shy;min levels through several mechanisms such as an
increase in protein degra&shy;dation, inflam&shy;mation, and endothelial
dysfunction.  The latter causes increased permeability and loss of
proteins like pre&shy;albu&shy;min from the blood stream

<p></p>
<b>Hyperthyroidism</b> is asso&shy;ciated with a decrease in serum
pre&shy;albu&shy;min concen&shy;tra&shy;tions in part because the increased thyroid hormones
reduce the amount of thyroxine (T4) available to bind with pre&shy;albu&shy;min as
well as an increase in protein turnover and break&shy;down.  
In contrast in hypo&shy;thyroid states, thyroid hormones are sometimes low
resulting in increased pre&shy;albu&shy;min levels.
This is because the reduced availability of thyroxine leads to less binding with prealbumin, 
potentially causing an accumulation of unbound prealbumin in the blood.
<p></p>
<b>Pregnancy and estrogen-containing preparations</b> (e.g. oral
contraceptive agents, estrogen replacement therapy) increase serum
pre&shy;albu&shy;min concen&shy;tra&shy;tions due to increased liver protein synthesis in
response to the increased demand and hormonal changes (i.e., increased
levels of estrogen and progesterone).
<p></p>
<b>Medications</b> such a corticosteroids and non&#8209;steroidal
anti&#8209;inflam&shy;matory agents increase pre&shy;albu&shy;min concen&shy;tra&shy;tions

<b>Changes in fluid distribution and hydration</b> changes

and decreasing with hemodilution

Cut-offs for serum pre&shy;albu&shy;min applied for the diagnosis of
protein malnu&shy;trition  vary across countries.  In France and Poland,
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions of 0.10g/L and 0.05g/L have been frequently applied to
indicate protein malnu&shy;trition  and severe protein malnu&shy;trition,
respectively.  A recent two-part investigation, based first on a large
retro&shy;spec&shy;tive estimation to refine the two cutoffs, followed by a
prospective validation study, has redefined cutoff values asso&shy;ciated
with malnu&shy;trition  based on Receiver Operating Charac&shy;ter&shy;istics (ROC)
curve analysis.  In this study, serum pre&shy;albu&shy;min concen&shy;tra&shy;tions
indicative of malnu&shy;trition  and severe malnu&shy;trition  were reported as
0.17g/L (sensitivity 0.68; specificity 0.67) and 0.12g/L (sensitivity
0.53; specificity 0.73), respectively

However, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values obtained from the prospective
study were both relatively low (0.674 and 0.609) highlighting that
pre&shy;albu&shy;min is not an optimal bio&shy;marker to define protein malnu&shy;trition
and severe malnu&shy;trition.
<p></p>
Assay of serum pre&shy;albu&shy;min is inexpensive and easy.  Of the two
methods available, immune-nephelometry is more accurate than
immuno&shy;turbidimetry and was the method used in the cut-off study of
Delliere et&nbsp;al

<h3>  16b.1.4  Serum retinol&#8209;binding protein </h3>
<p></p>
Retinol binding protein (RBP) is the serum protein responsible for the
trans&shy;port of retinol throughout the blood stream and is bound to
pre&shy;albu&shy;min.  Of the visceral proteins, retinol binding protein has the
shortest half&#8209;life (approx&shy;imately 12h) with a relatively small body pool.  Retinol
binding protein is catabolized in the kidneys and is elevated with renal
failure.  Some of the factors affecting serum RBP are similar to those
outlined for pre&shy;albu&shy;min, including the decrease in serum RBP
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions during the acute phase response.  Unlike pre&shy;albu&shy;min,
however, RBP is signif&shy;icantly impacted by both vitamin A and zinc
status, low levels of these micronutrients inhibiting mobilization of
RBP in the liver.  Hence, these are additional factors limiting RBP as a
useful protein bio&shy;marker, limiting its use

<h3>  16b.1.5  Serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine</h3>
<p></p>
Serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine is a derivative of the skeletal muscle protein
creatine phosphate.  Creatine is a nitrogenous organic acid made up of
three amino acids, glycine, arginine, and methionine which is produced
mainly in the liver and kidney, and then trans&shy;ported to skeletal and
heart muscles.  Once in the tissues, creatine is phosphorylated to
creatine phosphate, a readily available energy source used for muscle
contractions

<p></p>
Creatinine in serum is produced from the spontaneous,
non&#8209;enzymatic break&shy;down of creatine in the skeletal muscle cells.  This
process is done contin&shy;uously at a nearly constant rate in healthy
subjects and is irreversible.  Conse&shy;quently, the body creatine pool must
be replenished daily by the intake of indis&shy;pens&shy;able amino acids.  As
serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine originates mainly from the creatine in skeletal muscle
cells, the circulating level of crea&shy;ti&shy;nine has been consid&shy;ered a
potential bio&shy;marker reflecting muscle mass, provided kidney function is
stable and under the steady state.  However, many other factors besides
muscle mass influence serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine concen&shy;tra&shy;tions, and the
contribution of muscle mass to the variation in serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine appears
small.
<p></p>
Several studies have shown serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine can serve as a
bio&shy;marker of skeletal muscle in healthy adults.  For example, Baxmann et al.

in a study of healthy adults classified as sedentary or
having mild or moderate / intense physical activity, observed serum
crea&shy;ti&shy;nine was signif&shy;icantly correlated with lean body mass measured by
bioelectrical impedance analyses (BIA), after adjust&shy;ment for
protein / meat intake and physical activity.  Several other investigators
have reported that serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine is also a surrogate marker of
skeletal muscle mass in dialysis patients, and that low lean body mass
in the dialysis population is asso&shy;ciated with increased mortality; see

however, highlight the many factors that
may influence serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine concen&shy;tra&shy;tions, limiting its use as a
bio&shy;marker for muscle mass; these are summarized below.
<p></p>
<b>Factors affecting serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine</b>
<p></p>
<b>Age and sex</b> influence serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine with lower levels
in the elderly and in females than males, both asso&shy;ciated with lower
muscle mass.
<p></p>
<b>Dietary intake</b> of creatine from meat is converted to
crea&shy;ti&shy;nine after cooking, so a large meal of cooked meat may increase
serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine.  High doses of creatine supple&shy;ments by indi&shy;vid&shy;uals
with risk factors for kidney disease may also lead to elevated serum
crea&shy;ti&shy;nine concen&shy;tra&shy;tions.  Dietary protein also has a small effect
because protein is the main source of the amino acid precursors of
creatine.
<p></p>
<b>Ethnicity</b> can influence serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine due to
differ&shy;ences in muscle mass and genetic factors.  For example, black
African Americans often have a higher muscle mass resulting in higher
serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine levels than Caucasians.
<p></p>
<b>Intravenous fluid administration</b> can also impact levels.
High fluid volumes dilute serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine levels, thus reducing
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions, whereas fluid restriction (e.g., dehydration) results in
elevated levels

<p></p>
<b>Pregnancy</b> is asso&shy;ciated with low serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions reflecting a physio&shy;log&shy;ically increased glomerular
filtration rate.
<p></p>
<b>Physical activity</b> increases muscle mass which is
reflected by a higher serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine concen&shy;tration.  Bouts of
strenuous exercise can cause trans&shy;ient elevations in crea&shy;ti&shy;nine levels
due to muscle break&shy;down.
<p></p>
<b>Chronic renal failure</b> is asso&shy;ciated with an elevated serum
crea&shy;ti&shy;nine reflecting a decrease in glomerular filtration rate.  Hence,
serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine cannot be used as a nutri&shy;tional bio&shy;marker in those with
reduced renal function.  In fact, crea&shy;ti&shy;nine is used as an indicator of
kidney function with high serum levels representing reduced kidney
function.
<p></p>
<b>Other disease states</b> such as advanced liver disease
reduce serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine due to decreased crea&shy;ti&shy;nine production arising
from a reduc&shy;tion in hepatic creatine synthesis.
<p></p>
<b>Numerous drugs</b> compete with tubular trans&shy;port mechanisms
and inhibit crea&shy;ti&shy;nine secretion, leading to a rise in serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine.
Examples include Probenecid, Cimetidine, Trimethoprim, and possibly
fenofibrate

<b>Sarcopenia index </b>

The sarco&shy;penia index (SI) is a simplified approach that aims to
predict skeletal muscle mass by comparing metabolites of different
cellular origins

It is consid&shy;ered more reliable for estimating muscle mass than
serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine alone.  The index is calculated as follows:
<p></p>
Sarcopenia Index= [(serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine/serum cystatin&nbsp;C) &times; 100]
<p></p>
Both serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine and Cystatin&nbsp;C are bio&shy;markers that are
filtered out by the kidneys and used routinely to estimate glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) in clinical settings.  Creatinine represents
muscle tissue, whereas Cystatin C is a protein derived from all
nucleated cells at a constant rate, is distributed in extracellular
fluid, and representative of all body tissue.  Additionally, Cystatin&nbsp;C
is completely reabsorbed and catabolized within the proximal tubule,
irrespective of age, sex, inflam&shy;mation, malignancy, infection, diet or
muscle mass.  Concen&shy;trations of Cystatin&nbsp;C increase in hyper&shy;thyroidism
and with steroid use and are lower in elderly persons and women.  With
normal kidney function, a low SI index indicates that the patient has
less skeletal muscle available for serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine production
(relatively low numerator) and thus, relative to Cystatin&nbsp;C, this would
indicate low muscle mass and potentially sarco&shy;penia (i.e., age&#8209;related
loss of muscle mass combined with low muscle strength)

For every 10 unit decrease in Sarcopenia Index (SI), the odds of a low skeletal
muscle index increased 1.4&#8209;fold.  This associ&shy;ation was superior to that
of serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine alone after adjust&shy;ment for the same covariates.

(see Section&nbsp;16b.5), and physical per&shy;for&shy;mance by the five-chair stand

In this review, low muscle
mass accompanied by low muscle strength and low physical per&shy;for&shy;mance
were the criteria used as the refer&shy;ence standard for sarco&shy;penia.
However, the optimal cutoff point for sarco&shy;penia detection based on the
SI could not be established, so more
research is warranted.
<p></p>
Studies have also reported associ&shy;ations between a low SI 
and a high risk of adverse clinical outcomes.  For example, in the
study of Barreto et&nbsp;al.

<b>Interpretive criteria and measure&shy;ment of serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine
and Cystatin&nbsp;C</b>
<p></p>
Reference intervals for serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine concen&shy;tra&shy;tions vary
with age, gender, muscle mass, and overall health.  Examples of
refer&shy;ence intervals for adults are 0.6&#8209;1.2mg/dL (53&#8209;106&micro;mol/L) for
healthy adult men and 0.5&#8209;1.1mg/dL (44&#8209;99&micro;mol/L) for healthy women.
These refer&shy;ence intervals will vary slightly depending on the crea&shy;ti&shy;nine
assay method and level of muscle mass.  For children, for example, the
refer&shy;ence interval is typically lower due to their reduced muscle mass
compared to adults, whereas for elderly adults, lower values are due to
age-related reduc&shy;tions in both muscle mass and kidney function.
<p></p>
Two colorimetric methods are used to measure serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine:
enzymatic methods and the Jaffe method.  Of these, the enzymatic method
is more sensitive and thus more suitable for detecting lower serum
crea&shy;ti&shy;nine concen&shy;tra&shy;tions anticipated in pediatric populations and
patients with lower muscle mass.  Point-of-care handheld devices have
been developed to assay crea&shy;ti&shy;nine in whole blood by enzymatic methods,
providing results in 2&#8209;15mins.  Such methods could be useful in the
field in low-income countries; see Kashani et al.

<h3>  16b.1.6  Serum Insulin-like growth factor 1 </h3>
<p></p>
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF&#8209;1) (formerly called 
Somatomedin&nbsp;C) is a peptide hormone produced mainly in the liver in response to
pituitary growth hormone.  Insulin-like growth factor circulates in the
serum largely bound to binding proteins (mainly IGF&#8209;BP3) with minimum
diurnal variation and a short half-life (approx&shy;imately&nbsp;24h).  Serum IGF&#8209;1
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions are dependent on age, with the lowest levels at birth,
peaking during puberty, and gradually declining in adulthood.  There are
also physio&shy;logical changes in IGF&#8209;1 levels during normal pregnancy, with
levels decreasing during the first and second trimesters, followed by an
increase by the 36th week of pregnancy

<span data-tippy-content="Huang R, Shi J, Wei R, Li J. Challenges of insulin-like growth 
factor-1 testing. Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 2024 Aug;61(5):388&#8209;403.">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38323343/"
	target="right" >Huang et&nbsp;al., 2024</a>).</span>

<p></p>
IGF&#8209;1 has an important role in up-regulating protein synthesis
and main&shy;taining muscle mass, with low serum levels possibly reflecting
nutri&shy;tional insufficiency and tissue catabolism

<span data-tippy-content="Livingstone C. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and 
clinical nutrition. Clin Sci (Lond). 2013 Sep;125(6):265&#8209;80. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23721057/"
	target="right" >Livingstone, 2013</a>).</span>


During periods of fasting, for example, serum IGF&#8209;1 levels decrease (by
nearly fourfold), increasing with nutri&shy;tional repletion

<span data-tippy-content="Keller U. Nutritional Laboratory Markers 
in Malnutrition. J Clin Med. 2019 May 31;8(6):775.">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159248/"
	target="right" >Keller, 2019</a>).</span>

Some investigators suggest that serum IGF&#8209;1 is more sensitive and
specific bio&shy;marker of protein-energy nutri&shy;tional status than pre&shy;albu&shy;min,
trans&shy;ferrin and retinol binding protein

<span data-tippy-content="Livingstone C. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and

	target="right" >Livingstone, 2013</a>).</span>

<p></p>
Never&shy;theless, many factors other than nutri&shy;tional status affect
serum IGF&#8209;1 and reduce its specificity.  Of these summarized in 
Table&nbsp;16b.5, the most notable is the acute phase response.  Conse&shy;quently, in
patients who have an active systemic inflam&shy;matory response, serum IGF&#8209;1
has limited use.  Table 16b.5 summarizes the other factors influencing

In anorexia nervosa patients, low serum IGF&#8209;1 levels are asso&shy;ciated
with nutritionally acquired growth hormone resistance.  
With nutritional rehabilitation, IGF&#8209;1 levels seem to correlate with improved 
BMI z&#8209;score.  As such, IGF&#8209;1 has been proposed 
as a measure of leaness and could be used to
monitor both short-term weight changes and nutritional
rehabilitation in anorexia nervosa patients

<b>Interpretive criteria and measure&shy;ment of serum IGF&#8209;1 concen&shy;tra&shy;tions</b>
<p></p>
Normal values for serum IGF&#8209;1 vary considerably between
indi&shy;vid&shy;uals, ranging from 27.0 to 45.4% making it difficult to establish
lower limits across populations.  Moreover, IGF&#8209;1 concen&shy;tra&shy;tions vary
with the assay used so assay-specific refer&shy;ence intervals are required.
Currently, there is an urgent need to develop refer&shy;ence intervals for
serum IGF&#8209;1; for more discussion of the issues involved see Huang et&nbsp;al.

Conse&shy;quently, currently, relative changes in serum IGF&#8209;1 may be
more useful than absolute values when monitoring nutritional
rehabilitation of chronically malnourished patients, provided the same
assay is used

<p></p>
Currently assay of serum IGF&#8209;1 is expensive and limited to a few
specialist laboratories.  The predominant methods for assaying IGF&#8209;1
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions in clinical labora&shy;tories are immuno&shy;assays, based on
either chemi&shy;luminescence or electro&shy;chemiluminescence.  Prior to the
assay, interfering binding proteins must be removed from the sample.
The most widely adopted method for removing binding proteins involves
acid / ethanol precip&shy;itation, now modified to include the addition of
IGF&#8209;2 to dissociate IGF&#8209;1 from the IGF binding proteins.  This
additional step ensures complete elimination of binding protein
interference and is now incor&shy;porated into automated systems in
commercial laboratories.
<p></p>
Modern mass spectrometric methods such as liquid
chro&shy;matog&shy;raphy-tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#8209;MS/MS) and liquid
chro&shy;matog&shy;raphy &#8209; high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (LC&#8209;HRAMS)
have also been developed which detect IGF&#8209;1 based on its molecular
weight and minimize interference caused by IGF&#8209;1 variants.  Both methods
deliver robust, reliable and accurate results; see Huang et&nbsp;al.

<h3>  16b.1.7  Plasma amino acids</h3>
<p></p>
Plasma amino acids concen&shy;tra&shy;tions reflect a complex pathway
influenced by many factors including protein intake, amino acid
oxidation, tissue break&shy;down, and protein synthesis.  As a result, there
is signif&shy;icant variability in plasma amino acid concen&shy;tra&shy;tions
between individuals

investigated changes in plasma amino acid
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions in healthy adults fed a series of diets deficient in
essential amino acids.  They noted a 30% decrease in fasting plasma
concen&shy;tra&shy;tions for some amino acids (phenylalanine, lysine, isoleucine,
and leucine) over the 12d study, whereas other amino acid levels
(threonine and valine) decreased by about half within four days of the
study initiation

Initially, the group
hypo&shy;thesized that the plasma levels of the deficient amino acids would
reflect the concen&shy;tration found in skeletal muscle.  Even though their
initial hypo&shy;thesis may have been a contributing factor, their results
suggested other processes may also be involved.  For example, the

fasting and fed state may reflect the role of carbo&shy;hydrates on amino
acid trans&shy;port into the liver for protein synthesis

<h3>  16b.1.8  Blood urea nitrogen/urea</h3>
<p></p>
Both urea and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are endpoints of the
meta&shy;bolism of dietary protein and tissue turnover.  Measured urea levels
reflect the whole urea molecule whereas BUN only reports the nitrogen
content of urea.  As nitrogen comprises about 50% of the urea molecule, BUN
levels are roughly half that of measured urea.  Nitrogen utilization
occurs very rapidly following enteral or parenteral nitrogen intake
whereas the overall urea pool is slow to change (7&#8209;10 turnover
time).  This means urea/BUN can be used as bio&shy;markers of protein intake
in clinical practice although they must be interpreted cautiously with
short term inter&shy;ven&shy;tions .  Additionally, serum urea/BUN levels may be
impacted by fluid status.  For example, levels may be artificially
elevated in a dehydrated state or artificially lowered with high
intravenous fluid administration and/or hyper&shy;volemia (i.e., fluid
overload).
<p></p>
Urea is commonly used as a bio&shy;marker in neonates admitted to
neonatal intensive care units (NICU).  A positive correlation between
protein intake and BUN has been observed in several studies of preterm
infants

In clinically stable enterally fed preterm infants, a BUN value lower than
1.6mmol/L (4.48 mg/dL) indicates insufficient protein intake and is
used to guide the use of human milk fortifiers.  Periodic determinations
of BUN are recommended by the European Milk Bank Associ&shy;ation to guide
indi&shy;vid&shy;ualized fortification of human breast milk in very low birth
weight infants

One fortification strategy
endorsed is called Adjustable Fortification (AF) and recommends
adjusting protein intake based on measured BUN.  For example, if BUN
levels are &lt;10 mg/dL then protein intake should be increased, whereas
when BUN levels are &gt;10mg/dL and inad&shy;equate growth is observed, then
non-protein calories should be increased with no change to protein
intake.  In contrast, with BUN &gt;16mg/dL and adequate growth, a decrease
in protein intake should be consid&shy;ered

recently examined the effect of this fortification strategy compared to
targeted breast milk fortification.  The latter is based on adjusting
fortification/intake based on analysis of breast milk compo&shy;sition

Adjustable Fortification but growth param&shy;eters did not differ between
the two strategies.

<h3>  16b.1.9  Immunological biomarkers</h3>
<p></p>
Consistent changes in immuno&shy;logical responses have been observed
during protein-energy malnu&shy;trition  which have been reversed with
nutri&shy;tional repletion

<span data-tippy-content="Lesourd BM, Mazari L. Immune responses during 
recovery from protein-energy malnutrition.

	target="right" >Roebothan & Chandra, 1994</a>).</span>

As a result, measure&shy;ments of immuno&shy;competence may be
useful markers of functional protein-energy status.  However, many
non-nutri&shy;tional factors (infec&shy;tions, illnesses, major burns,
medications, surgery, emotional and physical stress) influence the
immune response in the absence of protein-energy malnu&shy;trition .
There&shy;fore, to correctly interpret the results of immuno&shy;logical
measure&shy;ments, the results should always be interpreted in conjunction
with other bio&shy;markers of protein status.
<p></p>
Although no single test can measure the adequacy of the immune
response, the most frequently used tests are discussed below:
<p></p>
<b>Lymphocyte count.</b> Lymphocytes are small cells that
circulate between blood and lymphoid tissues and are derived from
hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.  Lymphocytes are the
primary cells of the acquired immune system and comprise 20&#8209;40% of the
total white blood cells (WBCs).  A decrease in total lym&shy;pho&shy;cytes, often
to less than 1500/mm<sup>3</sup> (refer&shy;ence range 2000&#8209;3500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) can be
supporting evidence of severe protein-energy malnu&shy;trition  in the
absence of any other hematological abnormalities

<p></p>
In clinical labora&shy;tories the lymphocyte count (and total white
cell count) are deter&shy;mined automatically using an electronic particle
counter (e.g., Coulter Counter).  These counters discriminate cells based
on their induced resistance as they pass through an electrical potential.
<p></p>
<b>Thymus-dependent lym&shy;pho&shy;cytes</b>.   Approximately 75&#8209;80% of the
circulating lym&shy;pho&shy;cytes are T&#8209;cells which affect destruction of
virus-infected cells, bacteria, and some malignant cells.  During severe
protein-energy malnu&shy;trition, both the proportion and absolute number of
T&#8209;cells in the peripheral blood may be reduced

This low

In most cases, these changes can be rapidly reversed with
nutri&shy;tional therapy.  Hence, sequential measure&shy;ments of T&#8209;cell numbers
can provide an index of the effect of a nutrition inter&shy;ven&shy;tion and
monitor nutri&shy;tional recovery in malnourished patients.
<p></p>
Measure&shy;ment of T&#8209;cells is performed by flow cytometry.  Isolated
immune cells are stained in suspension with fluorescently tagged
antibodies to identify cells of interest prior to analysis through a
flow cytometer; for more details, see Manhas & Blattman

<b>Delayed cutaneous hyper&shy;sensitivity (DCH)</b>.  This is used as a
direct measure of T&#8209;cell-mediated immunity in response to an antigen
that is observed on the skin.  When healthy persons are re-exposed to
recall antigens intradermally, the T&#8209;cells respond by proliferation and
then by the release of soluble mediators of inflam&shy;mation.  This produces
an induration (hardening) and erythema (redness).  These skin reactions
are often reduced in malnourished persons, although the response is
non-specific and occurs with marasmus or kwash&shy;iorkor and with
micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A, zinc, iron, and
pyridoxine.  The reactions are reversed, however, after appropriate
nutri&shy;tional rehabilitation.  Several other diseases and drugs also
influence DCH, so it is a poor measure of protein malnu&shy;trition,
espe&shy;cially in sick patients.  Box&nbsp;16b.3 summarizes the non-nutritional
factors that affect the DCH response, and thus reduce the specificity of
the test.

For this test, generally a panel of 4&#8209;5 antigens are injected
intradermally, often into the forearm.  The area of induration is
measured after 48h, with a positive result being taken as an area of
induration of at least 0.5cm.  Lack of response to all antigens is
called anergy.  A cell mediated immunity test kit for measuring DCH is
available which is preloaded with stan&shy;dard&shy;ized doses of seven antigens
(<i>Tuberculin, Tetanus toxoid, Diphtheria toxoid, Streptococus, Candida,
Tricophyton and Proteus</i>) in glycerol solution and a glycerin control.
Use of seven antigens reduces the number of false negatives and
increases the sensitivity of the test.  Use of this kit eliminates some
of the methodological problems asso&shy;ciated with the traditional skin
testing method.

<h3>  16b.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment of muscle mass based on technology</h3>
<p></p>
Muscle is a major component of the fat-free mass and the primary
site for glucose uptake and storage as well as a reservoir of amino
acids stored as protein, as noted earlier.  assess&shy;ment of muscle mass
can there&shy;fore provide an index of the protein reserves of the body,
which can be metabolized during prolonged periods of negative nitrogen
balance, leading to loss of muscle.  Indeed, loss of muscle mass is now
an important diagnostic criterion for the definition of protein
malnu&shy;trition  by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND)/American
Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN)

In the elderly, loss of muscle mass is a defining
characteristic of sarco&shy;penia (defined as loss of muscle mass as well
as strength).  Sarcopenia often occurs in the face of chronic and acute
illness and may be asso&shy;ciated with several negative outcomes, including
falls, fractures, and mobility disorders, cognitive impairments, and
mortality

The consensus report by the Global Leadership Initiative on
Malnutrition (GLIM) endorsed methods such as dual-energy absorp&shy;tiom&shy;etry
(DXA), bioelectrical impedance (BIA), ultra&shy;sound, computed tomography
(CT), or magnetic resonance imaging as validated measures of body
compo&shy;sition.  However, the advan&shy;tages and limitations of each technique
vary, and must be consid&shy;ered prior to selecting the appro&shy;priate method.
For more details of each of these methods, see Chapter&nbsp;14: Body compo&shy;sition: Laboratory
Methods 
<p></p>
Recommendations to support the use of these technological
methods for the assess&shy;ment of muscle mass in clinical patients are
inconsistent across expert groups.  For example, DXA has been endorsed
for body compo&shy;sition assess&shy;ment by the GLIM Body compo&shy;sition Working
Group, and European and Asian sarco&shy;penia working groups

Diagnostic ultra&shy;sound, also called sonography, is an imaging technique
used to measure various tissue thick&shy;nesses, including muscle, bone, and
subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue.  The device is low cost, and
capable of making fast and noninvasive regional estimates of body
compo&shy;sition with no exposure to ionizing radiation.  In the ASPEN
system&shy;atic review, only three of the seven ultra&shy;sound studies included

Bioelectrical impedance analysis measures the electrical
conductivity of a weak alternating current at one or more frequencies
passed between two electrodes attached to the body in various locations.
The current flows at various rates depending on the compo&shy;sition of the
body.  The current is well conducted by tissues with a high water and
electrolyte content such as lean tissues but is poorly conducted by
adipose tissue and bone which have a low water and electrolyte content.
The drop in voltage as the current passes through the body (i.e.,
impedance) is detected through the current sensing surface electrodes,
and the impedance data (i.e., resistance, R; reactance, X; impedance, Z;
and phase angle, PA) are recorded by the BIA device.  From the data
generated, estimates of fat-free mass and total body water can be made.
BIA has gained widespread use in both com&shy;mu&shy;nity and clinical settings
because it is a low cost, portable, and noninvasive tool with minimal
risks.  These features render BIA an ideal method for follow-up studies.
However, the accuracy of the estimates of fat-free mass is often
compromised in clinical populations who may have alterations in body
water or abnormalities in body geometry.  See Kyle et&nbsp;al.

measured

The BIA algorithms applied are
based on or validated against other body compo&shy;sition refer&shy;ence methods
(e.g., multiple dilution, DXA, and CT).  However, none of these
refer&shy;ence methods are totally accurate and error-free.
<p></p>
Many factors may influence the precision and accuracy of BIA
techniques.  They include factors asso&shy;ciated both with the indi&shy;vid&shy;ual
(e.g., degree of adiposity, fluid and electrolyte status, skin
temper&shy;ature) and with the environment (ambient temper&shy;ature, proximity to
metal surfaces and electronic devices), the assumptions under&shy;lying
prediction or modeling equations, instrumentation, and variations in the
protocols used for the BIA measure&shy;ments.  For more discussion of these
factors, see Section&nbsp;14.8 in Chapter&nbsp;14.
<p></p>
Interestingly, the ASPEN does not support the use of BIA for the assess&shy;ment of
body compo&shy;sition in the clinical setting, based on their system&shy;atic
review of 23 BIA studies.  Their main objections included the scarcity
of data on the validity of BIA in specific clinical populations,
difficulties comparing studies using different BIA devices, variability
in the body compartments estimated, and the proprietary nature of
manufacture-specific BIA regres&shy;sion models to procure body compo&shy;sition
data.  For a summary and discussion of the studies reviewed which led to
this conclusion, see Sheean et&nbsp;al.

The questionable validity of BIA approaches for the assess&shy;ment
of whole body compo&shy;sition estimates in clinical populations, espe&shy;cially
those with abnormal body geometry or altered fluid homeostasis, has led
to the use of raw BIA measure&shy;ments per se for bedside assess&shy;ment of
nutri&shy;tional status and/or clinical outcomes.  Raw BIA measure&shy;ments do
not depend on equations or models, thus eliminating bias and are
available from any single frequency BIA device.  From the raw BIA
measure&shy;ments generated, phase angle can be estimated, now known to be a
surrogate of both the quantity and quality of lean muscle mass

<h3>  16b2.1  Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) - derived phase angle</h3>

The derived phase angle
(PA) is a specific non-invasive measure&shy;ment obtained directly from a
phase-sensitive BIA device.  The phase angle concept is based on changes
in resistance and reactance as low-level alternating currents pass
through evaluated tissues, providing information on hydration status and
body cell mass.  As such, phase angle is being used as a marker of
abnormal body compo&shy;sition and low muscle strength.  The phase angle is
also sensitive to changes over time and hence could be useful in the
evaluation of different treatments.  Phase angle is obtained directly
from the raw param&shy;eters, resistance, R and reactance, X and is
calculated using the following equation

\[\small \mbox  { PA (degrees) = arctan (Reactance/Resistance) &times; (180 degrees/&#960;&nbsp;)}\]

Where arctan =arctangent; Reactance, X represents the health and
integrity of cells and reflects how much of the current is stored in
cell membranes; Resistance R indicates how easily the electric current
flows through body fluids and is deter&shy;mined primarily by the amount of
water and electrolytes in the body.

clinical applications of phase angle assess&shy;ment.  For example, a lower
phase angle can indicate compromised cellular health and may be
asso&shy;ciated with malnu&shy;trition  and sarco&shy;penia in the elderly. A system&shy;atic
review has confirmed that phase angle is decreased in sarcopenic
subjects, with a higher prevalence of sarco&shy;penia reported in those with
low phase angle

Typically, low phase angle values
are related to more-severe illnesses and worse overall health outcomes.
<p></p>
<b>Factors affecting phase angle</b>
<p></p>
<b>Age-related changes</b> in phase angle are relatively marked.
Phase angle values peak during early adulthood and then gradually
decline as indi&shy;vid&shy;uals age.  The basis of this age-related decline is
uncertain.  Several factors may be involved, including loss of muscle
mass and strength and physio&shy;logical changes in the ratio of
extracellular water (ECW) and intracellular water (ICW) with aging.
<p></p>
<b>Sex</b> differ&shy;ences in phase angle exist, with women having
lower values due to a lower muscle mass.
<p></p>
<b>Body mass index</b> (BMI) influences phase angle.  In adults,
values increase proportionally with BMI depending on the BMI range.  See
Bellido et&nbsp;al.

<p></p>
<b>Ethnicity/race</b> affects phase angle values.  In the US
NHANES (1999&#8209;2004) survey data, Hispanic and African Americans had
larger phase angle values than Caucasians.  Hence, ethnicity/race should
be consid&shy;ered when evaluating phase angle values

<p></p>
<b>Alterations in fluid distribution</b> affect phase angle
values.  In disease-related malnu&shy;trition  there is an early shift of
fluids from intracellular water (ICW) to extracellular water (ECW) space
with increased ECW/ICW and a concomitant decrease in body cell mass.
Both factors contribute to the lower phase angle values

<b>Interpretive criteria</b>
<p></p>
Several countries have generated normative refer&shy;ence values for
phase angle measured by BIA based on population samples; details are
given below.  Notable differ&shy;ences in phase angle normative refer&shy;ence
values across countries have been observed, some of which may be related
to ethnicity-specific differ&shy;ences in relative leg length, frame size,
and body build.  Such differ&shy;ences may also be contributed in part by the
devices used and/or lack of adequate standardization of the phase angle
measure&shy;ment technique.  Hence, stan&shy;dard&shy;ized population-specific
refer&shy;ence data may be necessary.  In general, values for phase angle in
a healthy population are reported to range from 5&#8209;8&deg;, with a decrease
with increasing age, older adults having values between 4&#8209;6&deg;.

provided phase angle cut-points (defined

on the US NHANES 1999&#8209;2004 data; these are presented in Table 16b.7.  For
the phase angle cut-points, fat free mass (FFM) index, generated by dividing

<h3>  16b.2.2  Fat-free mass index </h3>
<p></p>
Use of a fat-free mass (FFM) index has been explored in place of
fat-free mass alone to overcome the confounding effect of variation in
stature on fat-free mass.  Stature reportedly explains 45% of the
variance in FFM and 2% of the variance in fat mass 

<span data-tippy-content="VanItallie TB, Yang MU, Heymsfield SB, Funk RC, 
Boileau RA. Height-normalized indices of the body's fat-free mass 
and fat mass: potentially useful indicators

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2239792/"
	target="right" >Van Itallie et al., 1990</a>).</span>

Hence, the fat-free mass index (FFMI) assesses the amount
of muscle mass relative to a person's height.  It is calculated by
dividing fat-free mass (FFM) in kilograms by height in meters squared.
<p></p>
Fat-free mass index is used to evaluate nutri&shy;tional status among
patients with chronic illnesses or those under&shy;going treatments that may
affect muscle mass, such as cancer or chronic obstruc&shy;tive  pulmonary
disease (COPD).  For example, Zhang et&nbsp;al.

reported low FFMI was asso&shy;ciated with a worse prognosis even among cancer patients 
with a normal/high BMI, emphasizing the prognostic value of FFMI in these
patients.  Fat-free mass index is also used to diagnose sarco&shy;penia in
the elderly, and to evaluate the efficacy of treatment such as exercise
programs or medications aimed at improving muscle mass

Based on these findings, the GLIM have

malnu&shy;trition  for use for all patients and in all clinical settings

	<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31767002/"
	target="right" >Wells, 2019</a>).</span>

To date, however, challenges remain when applying
FFMI to assess nutri&shy;tional status in these children.
Under&shy;nutrition in children often coexists with edema, so depending on
the method used to measure body compo&shy;sition, some of the assumptions
applied to convert raw data into body compo&shy;sition values may have been
violated due to altered hydration (see Chapter&nbsp;14. Section&nbsp;14.8 for these
assumptions).  Increasingly in the future, BIVA may be employed to
differentiate between children who are dehydrated and those with edema,
as discussed earlier.  An additional challenge limiting the use of
FFMI in children has been the absence of normative
refer&shy;ence values and cut-off points that can be used to identify
malnu&shy;trition.  Current data indicate that universal refer&shy;ence data for
FFMI may not be feasible, and instead population specific
refer&shy;ence data may be required.  Furthermore, any comparison with the
refer&shy;ence values should be made using the same body compo&shy;sition
measure&shy;ment technique as that used to assess body compo&shy;sition in the
child under study

However, caution is needed when applying these FFMI cutoffs
across populations.  Ethnic-specific cut-off values for FFMI may be
needed.  South Asians are known to have relatively less lean body mass
and more fat at any given BMI value, and hence are likely to have lower
FFMI values than non-Asians

A major challenge limiting the use of FFMI in
children has been the absence of both normative refer&shy;ence values and
cut-off points that can be used to identify malnu&shy;trition in children in
low-income countries.  Current data indicate that universal refer&shy;ence
data for FFMI may not be feasible, and instead population
specific refer&shy;ence data may be required.  Furthermore, any comparison
with the refer&shy;ence values should be made using the same body compo&shy;sition
measure&shy;ment technique as that used to assess body compo&shy;sition in the
child under study

As a result, they are used to predict changes in protein
status in resource-poor settings, provided the changes are not small;
they are discussed below.
<p></p>
<h3>  16b.3.1  Mid-upper arm circumference </h3>
<p></p>
Mid-upper arm circum&shy;ference (MUAC) has been used in low-income
countries to identify protein-energy malnu&shy;trition  and to monitor
progress during nutri&shy;tional therapy.  In low-income countries the amount
of subcutaneous fat in the upper arm is often small, so changes in MUAC
tend to parallel changes in muscle mass.  As changes in MUAC are easy to
detect and require a minimal amount of time and equipment, they are
often used for screening for protein-energy malnu&shy;trition  in emergencies
such as famines and refugee crises.  In these situations, measure&shy;ment of
weight and height may not be feasible, and ages of the children are
often uncertain

<span data-tippy-content="de&nbsp;Onis, M., Yip, R., & Mei, Z. (1997).

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/9141745/"
	target="right" >de&nbsp;Onis et al., 1997</a>)</span>.

In addition, use of a
weight-based nutri&shy;tional assess&shy;ment (e.g., WLZ) can be misleading in
children with severe acute protein-energy malnu&shy;trition  (SAM) who
frequently have diarrheal disease accompanied by dehydration, which
lowers the weight of a child.  For example, Modi et&nbsp;al.

showed that MUAC outperformed weight-for-length-score &lt;&minus;3 to identify
SAM in children from Bangladesh aged 6&#8209;60mo with diarrhea.  In such
cases, a fixed cutoff point (e.g., 11.5cm) has been used to distinguish
normal and children with protein-energy malnu&shy;trition  and diarrhea.
<p></p>
The use of fixed cutoffs to distinguish normal and malnourished
children assumes that MUAC is relatively independent of age.  However,
the age independence of MUAC has been questioned

MUAC is recommended because its
measure&shy;ment is less affected by fluid retention compared to the lower
extremities, a condition that often occurs in older adults.  Sarcopenia
is characterized by decreases in muscle mass, as well as strength and
function, all of which have multiple adverse health consequences.

Currently, there is no consensus on the MUAC cutoff to predict
low muscle mass and diagnose under&shy;nutrition in adults.  WHO has proposed
universal cutoff values for MUAC of 22cm for females and 23cm for males
to screen for under&shy;nutrition

However, reginal and
ethnic differ&shy;ences in MUAC exist, and a higher MUAC cutoff (23.5cm) has
been used to screen for under&shy;weight in women of reproductive age in
northern Vietnam.  If the lower WHO cutoff (22cm) had been used, many
women at risk for under&shy;nutrition would have been misclassified as
healthy.
<p></p>
Cutoffs for MUAC to predict low muscle mass and identify
sarco&shy;penia in adults have also been investigated.  In a study of
com&shy;mu&shy;nity-dwelling Chinese adults &gt;50y, Hu et&nbsp;al.

recommended MUAC cutoffs of &lt;28.6cm for men and &lt;27.5cm for women for
predicting low muscle mass, and &lt;27cm for both sexes to identify
sarco&shy;penia.  This cutoff was developed based on low muscle mass
diagnosed using the European Working Group on
Sarcopenia in Older People&nbsp;2 (EWGSOP2) criteria.  Whether these MUAC cutoffs for adults are
applicable for other race-ethnic groups warrants investigation.
<p></p>
WHO has developed MUAC-for-age refer&shy;ence data (Z&#8209;scores and
percentiles by sex) for children aged 3&#8209;60mo for international use.  The
curves show both age-specific and sex-specific differ&shy;ences for boys and
girls aged &lt;24mos.  Numerical Z&#8209;score tables and charts for boys are
also available.

<p></p>
Never&shy;theless, it is important to realize that the
MUAMC is a one-dimensional measure&shy;ment,
whereas MUAMA is two-dimensional, and
mid-upper-arm-muscle volume is three dimensional.  Conse&shy;quently, if the
volume of the mid-upper-arm muscle declines during protein-energy
malnu&shy;trition  or enlarges following a program of nutri&shy;tional support, the
MUAMC change will be proportionally smaller
than the change in the mid-upper-arm muscle area

Hence, MUAMC is insensitive to small changes of muscle mass
that might occur, for example, during a brief illness.

<b>Interpretive criteria and measure&shy;ment of
mid-upper-arm-muscle circumference</b>
<p></p>
Mid-arm-muscle circum&shy;ference is the calculated circum&shy;ference of
the inner circle of muscle surrounding a small central core of bone

	target="right" >Gurney & Jelliffe, 1973</a>)</span>.

The muscle circum&shy;ference of the mid-upper arm is derived from
measure&shy;ments of both the MUAC and triceps skinfold thick&shy;ness.  For
details on the measure&shy;ment of triceps skinfold thick&shy;ness, see Section
11.1.2 of Chapter&nbsp;11.  The equation for the calculation of
MUAMC is based on the same
assumptions as those described for mid-upper-arm fat area (see 
Chapter&nbsp;11, Section&nbsp;11.1.4).
<p></p>
As variations in skinfold compressibility are ignored and as the
triceps skinfold of females is generally more compressible than that of
males, female MUAMC may be under&shy;estimated.
As a further complication, the MUAMC
equation does not take into account between subject variation in the
diameter of the humerus relative to MUAC

limb fat and muscle areas for assessment of nutri&shy;tional status.

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:443/6975564/"

If MUAC = mid-upper-arm circumference, TSK = triceps skinfold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d1 = arm diameter, and d2 = muscle diameter.  
Then: <br>
<div style="text-align:center">
TSK = 2 &times; subcutaneous fat (d1 - d2) <br>and MUAC = &#960;&nbsp;&times; d1. <br>
MUAMC = &#960;&nbsp;&times; d2 = &#960;&nbsp;&times; [d1 - (d1 - d2)] 
<br>= &#960;&nbsp;&times; d1 - &#960;&nbsp;&times; (d1 - d2).  
<br><b>Hence MUAMC = MUAC - (&#960;&nbsp;&times; TSK) </b>
<br>
</div>
Where MUAMC =
mid-upper-arm-muscle circumference, MUAC = mid-upper-arm circumference,
and TSK = triceps skinfold thick&shy;ness.  Note that this equation is only
valid when all measure&shy;ments are in the same units (preferably mm).

<h3>  16b.3.3  Mid-upper-arm-muscle area </h3>

Mid-upper-arm-muscle area (AMA) is said to be preferable to
mid-upper-arm-muscle circumfer-ence as an index of total body muscle
mass because it more adequately reflects the true magnitude of muscle
tissue changes

Several studies have examined the
validity of mid-upper-arm-muscle area by comparison with in vivo body
compo&shy;sition refer&shy;ence methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
computer tomography (CT), bioelectrical impedance (BIA), and DXA.
Unfortunately, the validity of the calculated mid-upper-arm-muscle area
(AMA) as a proxy for actual arm-muscle mass is dependent on the
characteristics of the study population and the in vivo refer&shy;ence method
used.  For example, the traditional equation appears to overestimate AMA
in obese patients and may not be appro&shy;priate for under&shy;nourished children

<h3>  16b.3.4  Calf circumference</h3>
<p></p>
Calf circum&shy;ference is often used as a surrogate marker of
skeletal muscle mass when body compo&shy;sition techniques are not available.
The measure&shy;ment is simple and practical and has been reported as the
most used measure&shy;ment in clinical practice to assess muscle mass, based
on an international survey in 55 countries 

<span data-tippy-content=" Bruyère O, Beaudart C, Reginster JY, et al.

Calf circum&shy;ference has the added advan&shy;tage of having a lower fat mass
compared to other body sites.  As a result, the impact of fat mass on
the measure&shy;ments will be less

<b>Factors affecting calf circumference</b>
<p></p>
<b>Age</b> has little effect on calf circum&shy;ference in adult
males and females until age 60y, after which calf circum&shy;ference
decreases slowly with age, irrespective of ethnicity or race.  These
age-related trends in calf circum&shy;ference values appear to be confounded
by BMI.
<p></p>
<b>Sex</b> impacts on calf circum&shy;ference with males having
higher values than females.
<p></p>
<b>Ethnicity</b> or race differ&shy;ences exist due to alterations in
muscularity.  Such ethnic differ&shy;ences are confounded by BMI.
<p></p>
<b>Body mass index</b> influences calf muscle values.  Persons
with overweight/obesity have higher calf circum&shy;ference values, whereas
for those with BMI&lt;18.5, values are smaller irrespective of age,
ethnicity or race.  Such differ&shy;ences are attributed to the larger amount of
adipose and inter&shy;muscular adipose tissue in the calves, limiting the
usefulness of calf circum&shy;ference diagnostic per&shy;for&shy;mance as a marker of
muscle mass.  However, BMI adjust&shy;ment factors are available; see below

To apply the adjust&shy;ment factors, add 4cm to the calf
circum&shy;ference measure for BMI &lt;18.5 or subtract 3, 7, or 12cm from the
calf circum&shy;ference measure for BMI 25&#8209;29, BMI 30&#8209;39, and BMI = 40,
respectively.  Without these adjustments, raw calf circum&shy;ference
measure&shy;ments would result in an under&shy;estimate of the prevalence of low
calf circum&shy;ference in those with BMI = 25 and an overestimate in those
with a BMI &lt;18.5.

<p></p>
<h3>  16b.4.1  Urinary crea&shy;ti&shy;nine </h3>
<p></p>
Urinary crea&shy;ti&shy;nine is a break&shy;down product of creatine phosphate,
a metabolite distributed primarily in skeletal muscle, as noted earlier;
(see serum crea&shy;ti&shy;nine Section&nbsp;16b.1.5). Under the steady-state and a
stable kidney function, crea&shy;ti&shy;nine is usually produced by the body at a
relatively constant rate depending on the absolute amount of muscle
mass.  Several studies have investigated the relation between 24h
urinary crea&shy;ti&shy;nine and skeletal muscle mass using refer&shy;ence methods to
measure muscle mass.  These studies led to the devel&shy;op&shy;ment of prediction
equations to estimate total body muscle mass based on 24h urinary
crea&shy;ti&shy;nine excretion

This prediction equation was developed with total body potassium-measured
lean body mass as the refer&shy;ence for skeletal muscle (see Chapter 14, 
Section 14.2).  In a more recent study, the total body creatine pool was
measured in subjects who ingested a gel capsule filled with the stable
isotope deuterated creatine (DCR).  Skeletal muscle mass was deter&shy;mined
in these same subjects using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the
refer&shy;ence and reported to be well correlated with skeletal muscle mass
measured from the stable isotope deuterated creatine using mass
spectroscopy

<li><b> 
Dietary intakes of creatine and crea&shy;ti&shy;nine</b>  from
meat or supple&shy;ments increase urinary crea&shy;ti&shy;nine
excretion. Dietary protein also has a small effect
on urinary crea&shy;ti&shy;nine excretion because it is the
main source of the two dietary amino acid precursors
of creatine—arginine and glycine.
<li><b> 
Menstruation</b>  affects crea&shy;ti&shy;nine excretion. It increases
by 5%–10% late in the second half of the
menstrual cycle, decreasing just before and during
menstrual flow

<li><b> 
Age</b>  influences crea&shy;ti&shy;nine excretion, a decline occurring
with increasing age. This effect is attributed to
a probable progressive decrease in lean body mass
in absolute terms, a decrease in the proportion
of muscle in lean body mass, espe&shy;cially in men,
and a probable lower meat intake in older subjects

<li><b>

of crea&shy;ti&shy;nine. The decrease is not related to depletion

to creatine, to intestinal degradation of crea&shy;ti&shy;nine to
products other than creatine, and to a decreased urine
volume

Traditionally, the crea&shy;ti&shy;nine height index (CHI) as a percentage has been
used to evaluate the degree of depletion of muscle mass in children with
the marasmic form of protein-energy malnu&shy;trition.  In these subjects,
there will be a decrease in CHI because of loss of lean body mass to
main&shy;tain serum protein levels.  Knowledge of the exact age of the child
is not required, which can be an advan&shy;tage in low-income-countries.  The
CHI can also be used to monitor the effects of long-term nutritional
inter&shy;ven&shy;tions  on repletion of lean body mass in hospital patients.
Changes in adipose tissue and fluid retention in these patients have no
influence on CHI.  However, the CHI is not sensitive to weekly changes
in lean body mass and must be used over longer periods.

Urinary 3&#8209;hydroxy&shy;proline has also been used in earlier studies
in low-income countries on malnourished children with impaired growth in
whom excretion levels were signif&shy;icantly lower than thoseF in
age-matched, well-nourished children, irrespective of whether the
malnourished children had kwash&shy;iorkor, marasmus, 
or marasmic-kwash&shy;iorkor. However, in clinical settings, 
urinary 3&#8209;hydroxy&shy;proline is commonly
used for cancer screening (and not as a nutri&shy;tional bio&shy;marker).  In
cancer screening, levels are elevated because cancerous cells destroy
the high collagen content of the cellular basement membrane

A variety of extraneous factors are known to influence urinary

<ul>
<li><b> 
Age-related changes</b>  in urinary 3&#8209;hyroxyproline
excretion are related to differ&shy;ences in growth velocity:
excretion rises rapidly during periods of
fast growth. Hence, the highest excretion is
apparent during the adolescent growth period
(11–16 y), after which there is a gradual reduc&shy;tion
in hydroxy&shy;proline excretion.
<li><b> Gender</b>  influences urinary 3&#8209;hydroxy&shy;proline excretion.
Males, for example, have greater
amounts of soft and calcified tissue and excrete
larger amounts of hydroxy&shy;proline than females.
<li><b> Infection</b>  influences urinary 3&#8209;hyroxyproline excretion
and complicates the interpretation of the
results.
<li><b> Intake of collagen or gelatin</b>  increases urinary
3&#8209;hydroxy&shy;proline excretion.
<li><b> Disease states</b>  involving disturbances in collagen
meta&shy;bolism such as rheumatoid arthritis
are asso&shy;ciated with elevated hydroxy&shy;proline excretion.
<li><b> Parasitic infec&shy;tions</b>  such as hookworm and

excretion.

<p></p>
<b>Interpretive criteria and measure&shy;ment of
3&#8209;hydroxy&shy;proline</b>
<p></p>
Recognition of the influence of age on
3&#8209;hyroxyproline excretion led to the devel&shy;op&shy;ment of the hydroxy&shy;proline
index.  This is independent of age in children and attempts to take body
weight into account and is shown below:

\[\small \frac{\mbox{mg hydroxy&shy;proline per ml urine}} 
{\mbox{mg creatinine per ml urine}} &times; \mbox{kg body weight}\]

In well-nourished children between 1 and 6y, the hydroxy&shy;proline index
is relatively constant and is approx&shy;imately 3.0 whereas in malnourished
children the index is low, irrespective of the type of malnu&shy;trition  and
statistically related to the weight deficit

The use of 24h urine samples is preferred but it is not
practical for children.  Instead, early morning fasting samples can be
collected, thereby minimizing the effects of the dietary ingestion of
hydroxy&shy;proline.  Both colorimetric and high-per&shy;for&shy;mance liquid
chro&shy;matog&shy;raphy (HPLC) can be used to analyze urinary hydroxy&shy;proline.
The colorimetric method is available as a commercial kit.  For the
method, the urine samples are first hydrolyzed, then decolorized and
neutralized prior to oxidation to pyrrole.  Pyrrole is estimated
colorimet&shy;rically after coupling with p&#8209;dimethylaminobenzaldehyde

<h3>  16b.4.3  Urinary 3&#8209;methylhistidine </h3>
<p></p>
Urinary 3&#8209;methylhistidine (3&#8209;MH) arises from the catabolism of
the two skeletal muscle proteins actin and myosin. 3&#8209;methylhistidine
cannot be re-utilized for protein synthesis, but instead is excreted
quantitatively into the urine without further meta&shy;bolism.  There&shy;fore, in
indi&shy;vid&shy;uals in a steady state of body compo&shy;sition, 3&#8209;MH urinary
excretion has been proposed as a predictor of fat-free mass and muscle
break&shy;down

Never&shy;theless, there are several limitations to the use of 3&#8209;MH
(Box&nbsp;16b.6) for assessing the size and turnover of the skeletal protein

and it declines further in the

<p></p>
Of the confounding factors listed in Box&nbsp;16b.6, in clinical

protein turnover is sensitive to stressful conditions, resulting in an

protein mass

primarily arm strength, whereas if the subject is standing, lower body

In the United States, cross-sectional data (mean, SD) from the
2011 US National Institutes of Health Toolbox project are available for
height, weight, handgrip strength (kg), together with the 5th, 10th,
50th, 25th and 50th percentiles by side of hand (dominant and
non-dominant), sex, and age (3&#8209;17y)

used the same 2011 dataset to
compile refer&shy;ence values for US adults 18&#8209;85y.  Again, data for height,
weight, hand grip strength (kg) and percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th
and 90th) by sex, side of hand (dominant and non-dominant) and 13 age
groups (limited to 5y spans, except the strata 18&#8209;24y) are
presented.  No cutoffs for HGS based on the data for
either children or adults were derived.
<p></p>
In Germany, the normative refer&shy;ence values are based on a
nationally representative sample of healthy participants aged 17&#8209;90y.
Mean values for HGS across seven height groups (within
each age group:  17&#8209;19y, 20&#8209;24y, 25&#8209;29y, 30&#8209;34y,
35&#8209;39y, 40&#8209;44y, 45&#8209;49y)
were calculated and presented as sex-specific refer&shy;ence values,
stratified by age and body height.  For example, the refer&shy;ence value for
40&#8209;44y women with a height of 165&#8209;169cm is 34.8kg; this value increases
by about 1kg for every 5cm of additional height as shown in Table 16b.14.

Note that because all these normative refer&shy;ence values are based
on cross-sectional data, they are likely to under&shy;estimate indi&shy;vid&shy;ual
decline and hence should not be used to monitor the trajectories of
indi&shy;vid&shy;uals.  Moreover, as with all cross-sectional studies, such a
design limits the degree to which causal and age-related inference can
be drawn

Accurate measure&shy;ment of HGS requires use of a

The hydraulic hand dynamometer Jamar measures
grip force (kgf) and is accepted as the gold standard instrument.  The
Jamar dynamometer is small and portable, although relatively heavy
(i.e.,1.5 lb), with a dial that reads force in both kilograms and
pounds, and allows assess&shy;ment to the nearest 1kg or 2.5&nbsp;lb.

In Asia, the spring-type dynamometer (Smedley) that detects the
amount of spring tension (kgf) is more widely used.  Data generated by
these two devices are not comparable

	Box&nbsp;16b.7  Protocol for Performing Hand Grip Strength   </b>
	<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b> Calibration:</b> 
Before starting, make sure the dynamometer is calibrated according to
the manufacturer's instructions to ensure accurate measure&shy;ments
<li><b> Preparation:</b>   Ensure the participant is in a comfortable seated position
with their feet flat on the floor and their arm resting on a flat
surface.  
<li><b> Shoulder position:</b>   The shoulder should be in a neutral
position, and the elbow should be bent at 90 degrees 
<li><b> Wrist position:</b> 
Wrist should be between 0 and 30 of dorsiflexion 
<li><b> Grip Position:</b> 
Instruct the participant to hold the dynamometer in their hand so that
the handle rests comfortably against their palm.  The handle should be
adjusted for a snug fit, neither too tight nor too loose 
<li><b> Grip Technique:</b> 
The participant should be encouraged to grip the handle as firmly as
possible without straining excessively.  The four fingers should wrap
around the handle, while the thumb rests on the other side.  Ensure that
the wrist is main&shy;tained in a neutral position 
<li><b> Measure&shy;ment:</b>   Ask the
participant to squeeze the dynamometer with maximal effort for about 3
to 5 s. During this time, encourage them to exert their maximum
strength.  The participant should avoid any sudden jerks or movements
during the squeeze 
<li><b> Encouragement:</b>   "I want you to squeeze as hard as you
can for as long as you can until I say stop".  (When the needle stops
rising) 
<li><b> Rest Between Trials:</b>   Allow a brief rest period (about 1 min)
between each trial to prevent muscle fatigue that could affect
subsequent measure&shy;ments 
<li><b> Repeat Measure&shy;ments:</b>   Typically, three trials
are conducted for each hand alternately.  This provides a more accurate
representation of the participant's handgrip strength.  However, some
investigators see one trial as equally reliable.

Measure&shy;ment of grip strength obtained by dynamometry appears to
have good to excellent relative test-retest reliability, even among
older adults

Dynamometers should be calibrated
every 4&#8209;6mos to main&shy;tain longitudinal validity.
<p></p>
Dominant HGS occurs when the measure&shy;ment is taken
in the subject's dominant
hand and can provide insight into strength available for daily activities.
Some researchers have
suggested using a Relative Handgrip strength in which
grip strength is stan&shy;dard&shy;ized to BMI to
account for differ&shy;ences in body size
