<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Calcium is known for being a&nbsp;major constituent of bones
and teeth. About 99% of the body's calcium is found in
these hard tissues. Calcium is also an extra&shy;cellular divalent
cation in the blood, where it exerts functional roles such as
cell signaling and membrane transport. Its con&shy;centration in
blood is tightly regulated by many hormones including
parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin.
Blood levels of calcium are not useful in determining the
nutritional status of calcium because of these hormonal
influences. Dietary requirements for calcium are derived
using calcium balance, which is negative when calcium
intake is too low to main&shy;tain normal bone density and zero
in adults when calcium intake is sufficient or positive
during growth and pregnancy. Calcium balance can be
estimated using dual-absorptiometry (DXA) or measuring
urine and fecal losses. A calcium intake above requirement
does not stimulate further increases in bone mass; instead
excess intake can lead to adverse effects such as soft tissue
calcification and kidney stone formation. When calcium
intakes are low, and/or when vitamin&nbsp;D is inadequate to
permit sufficient calcium absorption, bone health is
impaired leading to rickets in children and osteomalacia or
osteoporosis in adults. Other health benefits of calcium are
under investigation.

<h2>23a.1 Calcium</h2>

Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body,
accounting for <span class="n">10&ndash;20g</span> per kg 
body weight in adults. Bone
is the main reservoir for calcium. The remain&shy;der is located
in body tissues (10g), blood, and the extra&shy;cellular fluids
(900mg). In con&shy;trast, a&nbsp;greater pro&shy;portion of the
distribution of phosphorus and magnesium, the other two
bone minerals, is located in soft tissue 

(<a href="#table23a.1">Table&nbsp;23a.1</a>).

 All of these three minerals have two major roles&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; as struc&shy;tural
components in bone and regulatory agents in body fluids.
 
 <h2>23a.2 Functions of calcium</h2>
 
Calcium has a&nbsp;struc&shy;tural role in bones and teeth, where
99&percnt; of the body's calcium exists primarily as calcium
hydroxyapatite  [Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>]. Bone is a&nbsp;dynamic
tissue that undergoes remodeling throughout  life except
for  the teeth. Bone formation is under the con&shy;trol of
osteoblasts, the bone forming cells, whereas bone
resorption is initiated by osteoclasts, the bone resorbing
cells. During growth, bone formation exceeds resorption as
bone modeling is predominant. In later life when only bone
remodeling takes place, bone resorption begins to occur at a
faster rate than bone formation and this results in age-related bone loss 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Siddiqui, J. A., & Partridge, N. C. (2016). Physiological Bone Remodeling: Systemic Regulation and Growth Factor Involvement. Physiology (Bethesda, Md.), 31(3), 233–245.">

     target="right" >Siddiqui and Partridget,  2016</a>).</span>
<p>
The remain&shy;ing 1&percnt; of total body calcium is in the soft
tissues where it has a&nbsp;regulatory role in several metabolic
pro&shy;cesses, including enzyme activation, vascular
con&shy;traction and vasodilation, muscle con&shy;tractibility, nerve
transmission, hormone function, and membrane transport.
When the levels of absorbed calcium from the diet are
insufficient to balance the obligatory fecal and urinary
losses, calcium is drawn from the bone and blood calcium
levels are main&shy;tained within narrow limits. This
homeostatic regulation of the calcium level in the blood is
achieved by the interaction of the parathyroid hormone
(PTH), 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D), and
calcitonin, the three major calcium-regulating hormones

     target="right" >Peacock, 2010</a>).</span>

Phosphorus, pro&shy;tein, estrogen, and other
hormones, including glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones,
growth hormone, and insulin also have a&nbsp;role 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Siddiqui, J. A., & Partridge, N. C. (2016). Physiological Bone Remodeling: Systemic Regulation and Growth Factor Involvement. Physiology (Bethesda, Md.), 31(3), 233–245.">

<h2>23a.3 Absorption and metabolism of calcium</h2>

Calcium balance refers to the state of the calcium body
stores (in bone) which are a&nbsp;function of dietary intake,
intestinal absorption, renal excretion, and bone remodeling.
A major con&shy;trol of calcium balance is the amount of
calcium absorbed. Calcium is absorbed across the intestinal
mucosa in two ways: active transport and passive para-cellular diffusion.
Active absorption of calcium is influenced by calcium and
vitamin&nbsp;D status of the individual, age, pregnancy, and
lactation. Active absorption occurs when intakes of calcium
are low relative to need, and is regulated primarily via
1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and its intestinal receptors. Passive absorption
is more important at high intakes of calcium 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Weaver, C. M., & Peacock, M. (2019). Calcium. Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.), 10(3), 546–548.">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30915443"
     target="right" >Weaver and Peacock, 2019</a>).</span>
<p>
Efficiency of calcium absorption is highest when dietary
calcium intakes are low or during periods of rapid
growth in infancy, early childhood, and adolescence, and
during pregnancy and lactation. Indeed, absorption is very
high during infancy (about 60&percnt;) 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Abrams SA, Grusak MA, Stuff J, O’Brien KO. (1997). Calcium and magnesium balance in 9–14-y-old children. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 66: 1172–1177.">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9356535"
     target="right" >Abrams et&nbsp;al., 1997</a>)</span>

and about 34&percnt; during puberty 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Abrams SA, Stuff JE. (1994). Calcium metabolism in girls: current dietary intakes lead to low rates of calcium absorption and retention during puberty. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 60: 739–743.">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7942582"
     target="right" >Abrams and Stuff, 1994</a>),</span>

stabilizing at about 
<span class="n">25&ndash;30&percnt;</span> in young adults. Subsequently,
the intestinal absorption of calcium decreases pro&shy;gressively
with age 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Christakos S, Dhawan P, Porta A, Mady LJ, Seth T. (2011). Vitamin&nbsp;D and intestinal calcium absorption. Molecular And Cellular Endocrinology 347:  25–29">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21664413"
     target="right" >Christakos et&nbsp;al., 2011</a>).</span>
<p>
Urinary calcium excretion is also regulated in response to
need. Normally calcium re-absorption in the kidney
nephrons is not 100&percnt;. When there is hypo&shy;calcemia to
stimulate PTH release, one action of PTH is to increase
efficiency of calcium re-absorption thus reducing calcium
losses in urine 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Peacock M. (2010). Calcium metabolism in health and disease. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology 5: S23-S30">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20541252"
     target="right" >Peacock, 2010</a>).</span>

Several dietary variables
affect both calcium absorption and retention and, hence,
calcium status. Diets high in pro&shy;tein increase the urinary
excretion of calcium (hyper&shy;calciuria), which, however, is
compensated by increased calcium absorption

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Mangano KM, Sahni S, Kerstetter JE. (2014). Dietary protein is beneficial to bone health under conditions of adequate calcium intake: an update on clinical research. Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care 17:69-74.">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24316688"
     target="right" >Mangano et&nbsp;al., 2014</a>).</span>

Dietary sodium also influences urinary calcium
losses, with high sodium intakes increasing urinary
calcium losses 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Bedford JL, Barr SI. (2011). Higher urinary sodium, a&nbsp;proxy for intake, is associated with increased calcium excretion and lower hip bone density in healthy young women with lower calcium intakes. Nutrients 3(11):951-961. ">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22254088"
     target="right" >Bedford and Barr, 2011</a>),</span>

and lowering bone density in women 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Devine, A., Criddle, R. A., Dick, I. M., Kerr, D. A., & Prince, R. L. (1995). A longitudinal study of the effect of sodium and calcium intakes on regional bone density in postmenopausal women. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 62(4), 740–745.">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7572702"
     target="right" >Devine et&nbsp;al., 1995</a>).</span>

Caffeine, like pro&shy;tein and sodium, also increases urinary calcium loss but
has only a&nbsp;small negative effect on calcium retention, which
can be offset by increasing dietary calcium intakes

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Barrett-Connor E, Chang JC, Edelstein SL. (1994). Coffee-associated osteoporosis offset by daily milk consumption: the Rancho Bernardo Study. Journal of the American Medical Association 271: 280–283.">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8295286"
     target="right" >Barrett-Connor et&nbsp;al., 1994</a>).</span>
<p>
High phosphorus intakes reduce urinary calcium losses
(i.e., have a&nbsp;hypo&shy;calciuric effect), but because they increase
losses of endogenous fecal calcium at the same time

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Heaney RP, Recker RR. (1994).  Determinants of endogenous fecal calcium in healthy women. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 9: 1621–1627.">

     target="right" >Heaney and Recker, 1994</a>),</span>

their net effect on calcium
balance is still under debate.  One might assume that there
would be no effect except in con&shy;ditions in which the
coordination between calcium and phosphate homeostasis
occurs through the actions of PTH, FGF&#8209;23 and
1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D. The disruption of this coordination, however,
can occur with disease states such as chronic kidney
disease (CKD)

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Peacock M. (2010). Calcium metabolism in health and disease. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology 5: S23&#8209;S30.">

 However, increasing
dietary phosphorus through inorganic phosphate additives
may have detrimental effects on bone and mineral
metabolism in humans and animals

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Vorland, C. J., Stremke, E. R., Moorthi, R. N., & Hill Gallant, K. M. (2017). Effects of Excessive Dietary Phosphorus Intake on Bone Health. Current osteoporosis reports, 15(5), 473–482. ">

 <p>
Phytates and oxalates can inhibit the absorption of
calcium by forming insoluble calcium com&shy;plexes in the
gastrointestinal tract 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Barger&#8209;Lux MJ, Heaney RP, Lanspa SJ, Healy JC, DeLuca HF. (1995). An investigation of sources of variation in calcium absorption efficiency. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 80: 406–411.">

Hence, they may have a&nbsp;negative effect on calcium status, although their
overall effect may be small unless dietary calcium intakes
are low. Some other dietary com&shy;ponents, including lactose
and inulin, enhance passive calcium absorption by
increasing calcium solubility in the ileum

<p>
Several clinical con&shy;ditions are associated with disturbances
in calcium absorption. Calcium malabsorption is associated
with gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's and celiac
disease, and intestinal resection or bypass. Intestinal
absorption of calcium is also impaired in patients with renal
failure, caused by the reduced synthesis 
of 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Peacock M. (2010). Calcium metabolism in health and disease. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology 5: S23-S30.">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20541252"
     target="right" >Peacock, 2010</a>).</span>

Excessive intestinal
absorption of calcium and hyper&shy;calcemia occur in
sarcoidosis, when excessive calcitriol appears in serum, and
also in vitamin&nbsp;D intoxication.

 Milk and milk pro&shy;ducts (e.g., cheeses,
yoghurt) are excellent sources of readily available
(bio&shy;available) calcium. Plant-based beverages made from
soy, almonds, rice and oats are available as substitutes for
milk, but must be fortified.  The availability of the calcium
from these beverages is unknown, except for fortified
soymilk for which the calcium availability is similar to cow
milk, but only if calcium carbonate is used as a fortificant

Unfortified plant-based beverages have
little calcium. Canned fish with bones (e.g., salmon,
sardines) are good sources of calcium. Leafy-green
vegetables are also good sources, but absorption of calcium
from some of these foods, especially spinach, may be low

Ancient grains (e.g., teff,
quinoa, amaranth) and nuts are good sources of calcium

but highly refined or modern
cereal grains such as wheat and maize are not.
 <p>
Preparation of foods may also be a&nbsp;factor influencing their
calcium con&shy;tent. For example,  in Guatemala, when corn
(maize) tortillas are prepared according to the Mayan
tradition of cooking corn with limestone and leaving it to
soak overnight in hot water, the calcium con&shy;tent
rises from  about 10mg to about 200mg of calcium per 100g

Foods fortified with calcium are available in many
countries. In the European Union, the following forms of
calcium are authorized for addition to foods and for use in
food supplements:  carbonate, chloride, citrate malate,
glucon&shy;ate, glycerophosphate, lactate, hydroxide, oxide,
acetate, L&#8209;ascorbate, bisglycinate, salts of citric acid,
pyruvate, salts of orthophosphoric acid, succinate, L&#8209;lysinate, malate, L&#8209;pidolate, L&#8209;threonate, sulphate

Supplemental sources of calcium are widely available in
many dosages and in a&nbsp;variety of chemical forms in many
countries. These pills, capsules and liquids are usually
regulated by the government.  For example, in the United
States, the following forms of calcium are allowable as
supplements: carbonate, phosphate, citrate, glucon&shy;ate, and

Some supplements that are derived from oyster shell, algae, and
in chewable drugs labeled as antacid such as TUMS<sup>TM</sup>, are
mainly in the form of calcium carbonate, the form of
calcium naturally occurring in rocks such as chalk and
limestone. This form of calcium is generally the cheapest to
buy and has the highest amount of calcium by weight
(40&percnt;). However, calcium carbonate is poorly absorbed
unless stomach acid is available for dissociation.  Also,
calcium carbonate is the form of calcium that causes the
most side-effects such as bloating and con&shy;stipation

Calcium balance studies pro&shy;vided the
evidence for values for ages 
<span class="n">1&ndash;50y,</span> whereas for those
over 50y, values were set to prevent bone loss. For infants
age <span class="n">0&ndash;6mos,</span> an AI is 
given based on the average intake
of calcium from human milk, whereas 
at age <span class="n">7&ndash;12mos,</span>
the AI assumes 120mg calcium from human 
milk plus 140mg calcium from com&shy;plementary food. The values set for
the AIs for infants pro&shy;vide enough absorbed calcium to
meet the calcium requirements estimated by the factorial
method. For children, estimates of desirable bone accrual
were con&shy;sidered; EAR values, which start at 500mg for
toddlers (age 
<span class="n">1&ndash;3y)</span>, rise to 800mg for children, then
peak at 1100mg for adolescents, were based on a&nbsp;new
calculation of calcium retention data

For adults, main&shy;tenance of bone through attaining
neutral calcium balance is the goal. The EAR values are
800mg for men age 
<span class="n">19&ndash;70y</span> and for women 
<span class="n">19&ndash;50y,</span>
and the RDA for these age groups is 1000mg. The
difference in age cut-offs for men (i.e., 70y) and women
(i.e., 50y) reflects data showing that women at 50y
experience abrupt bone loss at menopause in con&shy;trast to
men at this age where bone loss is slow.  For women over
50y and men over 70y, EAR values are similar at 1000mg
which translates into an RDA value of 1200mg.  This
higher level set for women over 50y and men over 70y
was con&shy;sidered a&nbsp;justified public health measure in the face
of supportive yet incon&shy;clusive data suggesting a&nbsp;higher
intake of calcium would prevent bone loss and pro&shy;tect
against fractures. Values during pregnancy and lactation are
not different from other women in the same age group in
view of the well documented ability of pregnant and
lactating women to increase calcium absorption, and hence
compensate for their increased needs

<h2>23a.6 Calcium deficiency</h2>

<h3>23a.6.1 Hormonal responses to calcium deficiency</h3>

Calcium homeostasis is under systemic (i.e., hormonal)
con&shy;trol together with additional local regulating factors
through intestinal absorption, influx and efflux from bone,
and calcium excretion and re-absorption by the kidney.
Serum calcium con&shy;centrations must be kept con&shy;stant at
approximately 2.5mmol/L, a&nbsp;con&shy;centration that is
con&shy;trolled by the interrelated action of three hormones:
parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, and calcitonin.
The first two hormones determine how much calcium is
retained in the body through con&shy;trol of absorption, bone
turnover, and renal excretion. Calcitonin has a&nbsp;role in how
calcium moves between the extra&shy;cellular fluid and bone

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, and Allergies. (2012). Scientific opinion on the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of calcium. EFSA Journal 10:2814. ">

     target="right" >EFSA, 2012</a>).</span>
<p></p>
Fasting, which represents acute calcium deficiency, causes
a decrease in serum calcium con&shy;centrations, inducing the
release of PTH via the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)
located on the cell surface of the parathyroid glands 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, and Allergies. (2012). Scientific opinion on the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of calcium. EFSA Journal 10:2814. ">

     target="right" >EFSA, 2012</a>).</span>

In hypo&shy;calcemia, PTH has three actions which
together bring serum calcium levels back to normal. The
immediate response is bone resorption to release calcium
into the blood. The second response is to increase renal
re-absorption of calcium in kidney tubules in order to retain
calcium. Finally, PTH stimulates 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D synthesis in
the kidney

which serves to allow active
absorption of calcium in enterocytes. Feedback con&shy;trol of
this rise in serum calcium occurs as a&nbsp;normal serum
con&shy;centration of calcium inhibits PTH secretion.  In
addition, higher than normal serum calcium stimulates
calcitonin secretion by the para-follicular C&nbsp;cells of the
thyroid gland, causing calcium to move into bone.

unclear, but it is a&nbsp;recognized treatment for
hyper&shy;calcemia

 <h3>23a.6.2 Bone health</h3>
 
Chronic calcium deficiency, arising from an habitually
inadequate intake or poor absorption of calcium, is one of
the many important factors associated with reduced bone
mass. Bone mass in later life depends on the peak bone
mass achieved during growth and the rate of the
subsequent age-related bone loss. The age span over which
peak bone mass is achieved is between the early teenage
years and age 30, during which time 95&percnt; of bone mass is
achieved. By 30y further gains are unlikely

although exact timing varies with the
skeletal site and sex. Optimization of bone mass is
important because it reduces the risk of osteoporosis in
later life.
<p>
Calcium intake and its association with bone health has
been the subject of intense debate as epidemiological
studies have not always found a&nbsp;con&shy;sistent relationship
between calcium intake and bone density. One reason is that
calcium is a&nbsp;threshold nutrient so that when present in
sufficient amounts, a&nbsp;higher calcium intake does not result in
any further improvement in bone mineral accrual

 In most countries the Nutrient Reference Values
(NRVs) have been set for main&shy;tenance of bone health. For
example, in the United States and Canada, the Estimated
Average Requirement (EAR) and Recommended Dietary
Allowance (RDA) for calcium for all ages is based on
main&shy;taining a&nbsp;positive calcium balance in children and
preventing a&nbsp;negative calcium balance in adults

Calcium-deficiency rickets and osteomalacia occur in
many parts of the world. Case reports from the United
States, South Africa, and Nigeria have described infants
and children with radiological rickets, growth retardation,
and bio&shy;chemical signs of hyper&shy;parathyroidism but with
normal vitamin&nbsp;D status. In all these cases of rickets,
habitual calcium intakes were low but phosphorus intakes
were adequate or high. Moreover, the children in
South Africa responded to calcium-rich
hospital diets

Osteopenia and osteoporosis are con&shy;ditions characterized
by a&nbsp;reduced bone mass.  In osteopenia, the T&#8209;score is low,
at &minus;1. In osteoporosis, reduction in bone mass is
greater, i.e., the T&#8209;score is &minus;2 and there is increased
bone fragility and risk of fracture. The T&#8209;score is a&nbsp;relative
rating expressed in standard deviation units describing the
bone mineral density (BMD) measured at the spine, hip, or
forearm.  A T&#8209;score is similar to a&nbsp;Z&#8209;score except it is not
measured against a&nbsp;same age person but rather against a
young adult with normal BMD.   Measurement is done
using a&nbsp;variety of methods described in Section&nbsp;23a.9.

Using moderate-certainty evidence from intervention studies,
WHO has made the following recommendation: In
populations with low dietary calcium intake, daily calcium
supplementation <span class="n">(1.5&ndash;2.0g</span> oral elemental calcium) is
recommended for pregnant women to reduce the risk of
pre-eclampsia. Additional con&shy;siderations included in this
recommendation are that all of the calcium may be from
foods, if possible; that the intake should be obtained in
divided doses, not all at once; and that iron supplements
should be taken at a&nbsp;different time from calcium
supplements.

Reduction in risk of colorectal adenomas with dietary
calcium was first postulated in 1984, whereby in the
presence of calcium ions, the toxic effects of free fatty
acids on colon epithelial cells could be reduced by
con&shy;version to insoluble calcium soaps

Since that time, numerous studies have refined this
hypothesis, and pro&shy;tective effects have been noted in
animal studies. A systematic review and meta-analysis of
randomized con&shy;trolled trials regarding calcium
supplementation for the prevention of colorectal adenomas
found a&nbsp;modest pro&shy;tective effect of

Blood cholesterol levels may be influenced by calcium
intake. A systematic review reported that calcium
supplementation reduced LDL cholesterol and increased
HDL cholesterol through mechanisms involving
suppression of calcium-regulating hormones (e.g., PTH)
that subsequently reduced intracellular calcium in
adipocytes, thus stimulating lipogenesis and lipid storage

However, as described below
in Section&nbsp;23a.7, excess calcium intake may be implicated in
pro&shy;moting cardio&shy;vascular disease. Hence, to date there is
no con&shy;clusion regarding the role of calcium intake in
reducing heart disease risk through cholesterol metabolism.
Body weight con&shy;trol by calcium has been debated for
many decades.  The initial suggestion  arose from the
finding that dairy intake facilitated weight loss better than
low calorie diets without dairy, an effect that was attributed
to calcium 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Zemel MB, Richards J, Milstead A, Campbell P. (2005). Effects of calcium and dairy on body composition and weight loss in African-American adults. Obesity Research 13:1218-1225.">

A recent trial com&shy;pared the
effect of supplements and dairy-con&shy;taining foods and
con&shy;cluded that con&shy;suming 4 to 5 servings of low-fat dairy
foods per day or taking calcium and vitamin&nbsp;D supplements
in persons with borderline dietary intakes of these two
nutrients is beneficial for weight loss and/or main&shy;tenance of
weight loss in postmenopausal women

<h2>23a.7 Effects of high intakes of calcium</h2>

There are several health con&shy;cerns regarding excess calcium
intake over long periods of time. The risk of renal stones,
risk of cardio&shy;vascular disease, and inhibition of iron
absorption are current con&shy;cerns 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Cormick G, Belizán JM. (2019). Calcium intake and health. Nutrients. 11(7). pii: E1606. ">

Previously, recognition that high intakes of calcium
caused calcification of soft tissue leading to &ldquo;milk-alkali
syndrome&rdquo;

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Whiting SJ, Wood RJ. (1997). Adverse effects of high-calcium diets in humans. Nutrition Reviews 55: 1-9.">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9155211"
     target="right" >Whiting and Wood, 1995</a>),</span>

was the rationale for
setting the first Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for
calcium at 2500mg/d for all persons older than 1y,
including pregnant and lactating women (IOM, 1997).  More
recently, the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board has set the
Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) at 2000mg/d for adults
over 50y due to reports of the increased incidence of kidney
stones occurring in calcium supplementation trials 

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine. (2011) Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin&nbsp;D. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. ">

target="right" >IOM, 2011</a>).</span>

A higher UL is set for other age groups in the United
States and Canada as the risk of stone occurrence in younger
ages is much lower.  The European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) however, as noted earlier, ruled that there was not
sufficient data to change from the previous UL of 2500mg
derived as the amount showing no adverse effects with
chronic intake

<p>
One con&shy;cern that remains con&shy;troversial is the effect of
excess calcium on risk of cardio&shy;vascular disease (CVD).
Many calcium trials were re&#8209;analyzed for heart effects even
though  none were  specifically designed to assess this effect.
The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis of
cohort studies and randomized con&shy;trolled trials 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Yang C, Shi X, Xia H, Yang X, Liu H, Pan D, Sun G. (2020).

found that calcium intake from dietary sources did not
increase the risk of CVD including coronary heart disease
(CHD) and stroke. However, there was evidence that
calcium supplements might raise CHD risk, especially
myocardial infarction. It should be noted that many of these
trials pro&shy;vided subjects (most often older women) with  daily
calcium supplements of 1000&ndash;1500mg without measuring
dietary calcium intakes or accounting for the habitual
calcium supplement use by subjects. Hence, calcium
intakes may have exceeded 2000mg/d, the UL level set for
adults over 50y by the Institute of Medicine

<h2>23a.8 Biochemical indices of calcium status</h2>

As calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated, there is no
satisfactory single test to assess calcium status directly on a
routine basis. Calcium is an important extra&shy;cellular
electrolyte (Ca<sup>&plus;&plus;</sup>) and 
can be measured in serum or plasma.
Normally values are reported as total calcium con&shy;centration,
but ionized calcium can be an important measure&shy;ment.
Hypo&shy;calcemia and hyper&shy;calcemia (reduced and elevated
serum calcium con&shy;centrations, respectively) are not likely to
be caused by dietary intakes alone except on a&nbsp;transient
basis. Urinary calcium excretion (calciuria) may give some
clues as to calcium metabolism but as levels are equally
likely to be from bone turnover or from dietary intakes,
calciuria is difficult to interpret on its own. Instead,
bio&shy;chemical markers of bone formation and bone resorption
are used as measures of calcium status as they reflect need
for calcium (shown as excess bone resorption) and calcium
adequacy (shown as appro&shy;priate bone formation)

<h3>23a.8.1 Serum calcium and its regulation</h3>

Serum calcium is not a&nbsp;test of nutritional status but rather
reflects hormonal regulation of calcium, not calcium
balance. Calcium is present in the blood in three different
forms: as free Ca<sup>2&plus;</sup> ions, 
bound to pro&shy;tein (about 45&percnt;),
and com&shy;plexed to citrate, phosphate, sulfate and
carbonate (about 10&percnt;). Calcium in the blood (and in
extra&shy;cellular fluid) is kept con&shy;stant at 2.5mmol/L (range
<span class="n">2.25&ndash;2.6mmol/L)</span>, but 
it is ionized calcium (between 
<span class="n">1.1&ndash;1.4mmol/L)</span> that is the form that is actively transported
across membranes 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, and Allergies. (2012). Scientific opinion on the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of calcium. EFSA Journal 10:2814. ">
       (<a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2814"
     target="right" >EFSA, 2012</a>).</span>

Values decrease with age
in men. Females usually have slightly lower con&shy;centrations
<span class="n">(2.20&ndash;2.54mmol/L)</span>, associated with small differences in
serum albumin con&shy;tent and the calcium-reducing effect of
estrogens. Serum calcium decreases by 
<span class="n">5&ndash;10&percnt;</span> up to the
end of the third trimester of pregnancy, after which
con&shy;centrations rise. This decrease in total serum calcium
may not be &ldquo;true&rdquo; hypo&shy;calcemia, as it is not due to a
decrease in ionized calcium. However, changes in the
serum chemistries and calcium-regulating hormones can be
mistaken as a&nbsp;disorder of calcium 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Almaghamsi A, Almalki MH, Buhary BM. (2018). Hypo&shy;calcemia in pregnancy: a&nbsp;clinical review update. Oman Medical Journal 33:453-462.">

     target="right" >Almaghamsi et&nbsp;al., 2018</a>).</span>
<p>
Hypo&shy;calcemia (low serum calcium) and hyper&shy;calcemia
(elevated serum calcium) indicate serious disruption of
calcium homeostasis but generally do not reflect calcium
balance. In severe hypo&shy;calcemia, blood 
calcium is &lt;&nbsp;2.12mmol/L, and in severe 
hyper&shy;calcemia blood calcium is &gt;&nbsp;2.72mmol/L. 
Serum calcium levels must be corrected for the
serum albumin con&shy;centration before con&shy;firming the
diagnosis of hyper&shy;calcemia or hypo&shy;calcemia 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Fong J, Khan A. (2012). Hypo&shy;calcemia: updates in diagnosis and management for primary care. Canadian Family Physician 58:158-162.">

<p>
Hypo&shy;calcemia is most com&shy;monly a&nbsp;con&shy;sequence of
vitamin&nbsp;D inadequacy or hypo&shy;para&shy;thyroidism, or a
resistance to either of these hormones. Hypo&shy;calcemia has
also been associated with the use of certain drugs including
bisphos&shy;phonates, cisplatin, anti&shy;epileptics, diuretics, and
pro&shy;ton pump inhibitors. Symptoms of hypo&shy;calcemia may
include muscle spasms, cramps, tetany, numb&shy;ness, and
seizures, but also can be asymp&shy;tomatic

Hypo&shy;calcemia is com&shy;mon in the critically ill patient
but the interpretation of the low serum calcium level is
complicated by the co-existence of hypo&shy;albuminemia and
disorders of acid-base balance, thus in these patients
hypo&shy;calcemia is defined in terms of ionized calcium
con&shy;centration rather than  total calcium con&shy;centration.
Mechanisms causing hypo&shy;calcemia in critically ill patients
include: hypo&shy;para&shy;thyroidism, severe vitamin&nbsp;D deficiency,
hyper&shy;phos&shy;phatemia, infusion of chelating agents such as
citrate, alkalosis caused by hyper&shy;ventilation, and
pancreatitis that causes a rise of free fatty acids (FFAs) that
result in increased binding of calcium to albumin 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Kelly A, Levine MA. (2013). Hypo&shy;calcemia in the critically ill patient. Journal of Intensive Care Medicine 28(3):166-177.">

 <p>
Hyper&shy;calcemia occurs in association with
hyper&shy;para&shy;thyroidism, hyper&shy;thyroidism, and sarcoid&shy;osis and
when large parts of the body are immobilized (e.g., when a
patient is hospitalized after spinal cord injury or major
limb-bone fractures). In the latter cases, calcium from the
rapidly atrophying bone is released into the circulating
body fluids. In addition, hyper&shy;calcemia is one of the
characteristic features of vitamin&nbsp;D intoxication. It arises
from hyper&shy;absorption of intestinal calcium and to a&nbsp;lesser
degree from the release of calcium from bone

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Peacock M. (2010). Calcium metabolism in health and disease. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology 5: S23-S30.">

Severe chronic hyper&shy;calcemia can result in
nephrolithiasis (renal stones) and impairment of kidney
function, as well as in calcification of soft tissues (e.g.,
nephrocalcinosis and vascular calcification), the latter when
phosphorus con&shy;centrations in the blood are also high, as in
renal insufficiency

Hyper&shy;calcemia may occur in advanced stages of the
following cancers:  multiple myeloma, breast cancer,
parathyroid cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer, lymphoma,
leukemia, and bone metastases

This hyper&shy;calcemia causes many unpleasant clinical
symptoms such as vomiting, anorexia, con&shy;stipation,
frequent and increased urination, a&nbsp;patient may seek
medical treatment at which time blood levels may be
measured along with urinalysis and kidney function tests.
Treatment would involve initially reducing hyper&shy;calcemia
through  fluid replacement followed by use 
of calcium-losing diuretics such as furosemide. As well, anti-resorptive
medications such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, that
reduce bone turnover, may be used to prevent calcium
release from bone resorption.

<h3>23a.8.2 Measurement of serum calcium</h3>

Serum calcium levels have traditionally been determined by
flame atomic absorption spectro&shy;photometry (AAS)

       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14228268"
     target="right" >Zettner and Seligson, 1964</a>)</span>

or by automated pro&shy;cedures that use
the o&#8209;cresolphthalein com&shy;plexone method 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Bourke E, Delaney V. (1993). Assessment of hypo&shy;calcemia and hyper&shy;calcemia. Clinics in Laboratory Medicine 13: 157–181.">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8462259"
     target="right" >Bourke and Delaney, 1993</a>).</span>

Earlier methods used flame photometry.
For surveying the American population, the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) uses
a DxC800 system with ion-selective electrode methodology
to measure calcium con&shy;centrations in serum, plasma, or
urine. Only NHANES&nbsp;III pro&shy;vides ionized calcium values
for the American population. Considerable differences in
the quality of serum calcium measure&shy;ments among
laboratories may occur, emphasizing the necessity for
rigorous quality-con&shy;trol practices. In general, the
coefficient of variation for the AAS method is less than that
for flame photometry

Analytical variation for serum calcium 
via AAS ranges from 
<span class="n">0.9&percnt;&ndash;3.04&percnt;</span>

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Gallagher SK, Johnson LK, Milne DB. (1989). Short-term and long-term variability of indices related to nutritional status. I: Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, and Zn. Clinical Chemistry 35: 369–373.">

<p>
As such a&nbsp;large amount of calcium in serum is bound to
albumin, it follows that con&shy;centrations can be influenced by
changes in serum albumin levels. As a&nbsp;result, when serum
albumin levels are outside the normal limits

as may occur in liver disease or malnutrition, serum
calcium values should be corrected, as noted earlier. The
correction is approximate, and if there is uncertainty in the
interpretation of the results, serum ionized calcium should
be directly determined.
<p>
In many methods. serum rather than plasma should be used
for calcium analysis as the former has no anticoagulant
added. Most anticoagulants, with the notable exception of
lithium heparin, interfere with the determination of
calcium: they com&shy;plex with or precipitate the calcium in
the sample.

<h3>23a.8.3 Measurement of serum ionized calcium</h3>

Fasting blood samples are recommended for the
measure&shy;ment of ionized calcium in serum, to eliminate the
effect of a&nbsp;recent meal. The samples should be stored
anerobically at 0&deg;C prior to the assay. Serum ionized
calcium can be measured using com&shy;mercially 
available ion-specific electrodes 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Wandrup J, Kvetny J. (1985). Potentiometric measurement of ionized calcium in anaerobic whole blood, plasma, and serum evaluated. Clinical Chemistry 31: 856–860.">

Care must be taken to ensure that the calcium standards used for
the assay con&shy;tain sodium and chloride at the same levels as
in the test samples. Further details on preparing blood for
ionized calcium are published

Factors affecting serum ionized calcium levels include
physical activity and circadian rhythm.

that &ldquo;adjust&rdquo; total calcium with albumin and/or pro&shy;tein
levels, and sometimes including other blood con&shy;stituents
such as phosphate

There are over
30 published formulas, with the most widely used one
being the Payne Formula: 

\[\small \mbox{Adjusted calcium (mmol/L)&nbsp;&equals;&nbsp;Total 
calcium (mmol/L)&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;0.02 (40&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;serum albumin (g/L))}\]
However, caution is advised before applying this formula
as it is not applicable in many situations.
<p>
The clinical utility of ionized calcium ranges from
con&shy;ditions with moderate evidence (drug-induced calcium
disorders, cardio&shy;vascular outcomes), good 
evidence (post-thyroidectomy hypo&shy;calcemia), and very good to strong
evidence (calcium disorders in critically ill patients,
primary hyper&shy;para&shy;thyroidism, malignancy-related
hyper&shy;calcemia). There is poor to fair evidence for use of
ionized calcium in pre-eclampsia

<h3>23a.8.4 Calcium balance</h3>

Calcium is lost daily through urinary and fecal excretion. In
the gastrointestinal tract, calcium is lost through sloughing
of cells as well as unabsorbed calcium in the feces. A small
amount of calcium is lost in sweat.  Replacement of these
losses must occur through the diet

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Weaver, C. M., & Peacock, M. (2019). Calcium. Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.), 10(3), 546–548.">

     target="right" >Weaver and Peacock, 2019</a>).</span>

A zero calcium balance means all losses have been
replaced, and there is no net bone loss to pro&shy;vide serum
calcium during periods of fasting. A positive calcium
balance indicates that losses are less than intake, and
implies calcium accretion into bones, an expected finding
during growth and during pregnancy. A negative calcium
balance means losses exceed intake, and the additional
calcium lost is from bone. Over time a&nbsp;negative calcium
balance indicates bone formation is less than bone
resorption.

 pro&shy;vides a&nbsp;summary of these
assumptions.
 <p>
Measurement of calcium balance was a&nbsp;main&shy;stay of
nutrition research prior to the introduction of bone imaging
equipment.  These early experiments required facilities
(metabolic units) where participants could receive all
meals, sometimes for several months. A typical
experimental pro&shy;tocol would adhere to the following steps:
<ol>
<li>participants ingest the experimental diet for at least one
week adaptation; 
<li>in each 15d cycle participants
would con&shy;sume only those foods and beverages pro&shy;vided,
and every day collect 24h urine samples; 
<li>additionally participants would collect all feces along with
con&shy;sumption of a&nbsp;fecal marker during these 15d; 
<li>study research personal prepare com&shy;posites of  food, urine,
and feces representing each of three 5d cycles; and
<li>calcium was measured in the food and fecal com&shy;posites
after dry ashing to remove the organic material, followed
by quantitative dilution, while urine was acidified to
prevent precipitation of calcium

 </li></ol>

Balance is calculated as Ca-intake minus Ca-losses.
Unless participants resided in a&nbsp;metabolic unit, calcium
losses through sweat were not taken into con&shy;sideration.
Overall, this method is expensive and requires exceptional
participant cooperation.

<h3>23a.8.5  Urinary calcium as a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker</h3>

The amount of urinary calcium excreted is highly variable
as it is dependent on the diet and the efficiency of intestinal
absorption. Under con&shy;ditions of bone accretion, one
expects less calcium to be excreted as bones are forming,
while during bone loss, more excretion might be observed.
Measure of 24h urine calcium may pro&shy;vide some
indication of calcium intake as extremely low excretion
rates may indicate low calcium intake. However, extremely
high excretion rates, (i.e., hyper&shy;calciuria), may be
indicative of bone loss or clinical con&shy;ditions unrelated to
dietary intake.
<p>
For calcium balance, a&nbsp;24h collection of urine is
necessary to obtain the estimate of calcium excretion, yet
this pro&shy;cedure requires enormous participant com&shy;pliance.
To gauge an indication of urinary calcium rate, some
studies measure calcium in spot urine samples, usually after
an overnight fast, when urinary calcium is expressed per
mg or mmol of urinary creatinine.  Using urinary creatinine
in the denominator corrects for variability of urinary
excretion as the amount of creatinine excreted in 24 hours
is con&shy;stant for individuals. Further, creatinine excretion can
be used as an measure of muscle mass as it is made from
creatine. Hence, when expressing urinary calcium excretion
as a&nbsp;ratio of urinary creatinine excretion, one can equalize
excretion between participants of dissimilar body mass.
There is good correlation between excretion ratios of
calcium expressed per mg or mmol of urinary creatinine in
24h urine collections and those based on spot urine
collections

<h3>23a.8.6 Biomarkers of bone formation and resorption</h3>

Bone remodeling is an important pro&shy;cess that con&shy;tinuously
renews bone throughout life. It repairs micro-damage,
main&shy;tains mineral homeostasis, and ensures mechanical
pro&shy;ficiency by modifying the micro-architecture. Bone
remodeling is regulated by a&nbsp;variety of systemic and local
factors. Bone remodeling involves the following cycle of
events: osteocyte signaling, recruitment of osteoclasts to
begin resorption, degradation and removal of bone,
reversal, formation of new bone by osteoblasts, and then a
period of resting

formation or degradation of the bone matrix brought about
by dietary influences, such as availability of calcium,

changing, a&nbsp;com&shy;bination of bio&shy;markers, such as one

more information than a&nbsp;single marker

<h3>23a.8.6.1 Biomarkers of bone formation</h3>
Bone formation is determined by measuring pro&shy;teins that
increase in serum as a&nbsp;result of osteoblast activity during
bone formation.  These include bone alkaline phosphatase
(BALP), which is measured as enzymatic activity, and the
vitamin&nbsp;K&#8209;dependent pro&shy;tein osteocalcin (OC).  A third
marker, pro&shy;collagen type&nbsp;I&nbsp;N&#8209;terminal pro&shy;peptide (PINP)
that reflects the pro&shy;tein synthesis capacity of the osteoblast
can also be used. Early measure&shy;ment of these three bone
formation markers (OC, BALP and particularly PINP) has
shown positive correlations with subsequent bone mineral
density improvements in trials of teriparatide, a&nbsp;drug
pro&shy;moting bone formation  

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Bonjour JP, Kohrt W, Levasseur R, Warren M, Whiting S, Kraenzlin M. (2014).

Bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), an isoenzyme also
known as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase or skeletal
alkaline phosphatase, is measured in serum, and is essential
for normal bone mineralization. Several techniques have
been developed to measure the activity of this enzyme. In
adults approximately 50&percnt; of serum total alkaline
phosphatase is present as bone alkaline phosphatase,
whereas during childhood, the bone isoenzyme
predominates. BALP may also be measured when assessing
vitamin&nbsp;D deficiency (see chapter 18b.12.2) during which
osteoblast activity is suppressed due to low calcium
absorption. Thus, BALP is not specific to calcium
deficiency and interpretation of its activity must be
accompanied by other measure&shy;ments.
<p>
Osteocalcin (OC), measured in serum, is also called a&nbsp;bone
&gamma;&#8209;carboxy&shy;glutamic acid–con&shy;taining pro&shy;tein because it
con&shy;tains up to three &gamma;&#8209;carboxy&shy;glutamic acid residues. This
small non-collagenous pro&shy;tein is specific for bone tissue
and dentin and com&shy;prises about 
<span class="n">1&ndash;2&percnt;</span> of total bone
pro&shy;tein. During synthesis of osteocalcin, a&nbsp;small fraction is
released directly into the blood. Osteocalcin is cleared by
the kidneys so that serum levels depend on renal function.
The half-life of serum osteocalcin is short 
<span class="n">(15&ndash;70min).</span>
Uncertainties persist as to the exact role of osteocalcin.
Indeed, osteocalcin is secreted solely by osteoblasts, yet has
only minor effects on bone mineralization. Instead,
osteocalcin acts as a&nbsp;hormone-like factor in glucose
homeostasis, brain development, cognition, and male
fertility

Most of the organic
matrix of bone is type&nbsp;I collagen associated with
non-collagenous pro&shy;teins, and Type&nbsp;I collagen is rich in the
amino acid hydroxy-pro&shy;line. During the con&shy;version of
pro&shy;collagen to collagen, which occurs extra&shy;cellularly, the
pro&shy;collagen pro&shy;peptides, pro&shy;collagen type&nbsp;I&nbsp;carboxy-
terminal pro&shy;peptide (PICP) and pro&shy;collagen 
type&nbsp;I&nbsp;amino&shy;terminal&nbsp;pro&shy;peptide (PINP) 
are released into the
circulation. Although both bone alkaline phosphatase and
PINP are markers of bone formation,  PINP is the reference
bio&shy;marker for bone formation

<h3>23a.8.4.2 Biomarkers of bone resorption</h3>

Bone resorption markers include the pyridinium 
cross-links (PYR) subdivided into pyridinoline and
deoxypyridinoline together with the associated
telopeptides, i.e., carboxy terminal telopeptide (CTX) and
N&#8209;terminal telopeptide (NTX), all of which are released
during collagen breakdown (<a href="#table23a.6"> Table&nbsp;23a.6</a>).  A second marker
of bone resorption is tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
(TRAP), a&nbsp;measure of osteoclast number

<p>
Pyridinium cross-links (PYD) measured in urine were
among the first bone bio&shy;markers of resorption, but are
rarely measured today. The crosslinks are
hydroxylysylpyridinoline (known as pyridinoline, PYD)
and lysylpyridinoline (known as deoxypyridinoline, DPD)
and are important for the struc&shy;tural integrity of the
collagen. Pyridinoline is widely distributed in both type&nbsp;I
collagen of bone and type&nbsp;II collagen of cartilage, as well
as in smaller amounts in the other con&shy;nective tissues, and is
thus con&shy;sidered non-specific. In con&shy;trast,
deoxypyridinoline is found almost exclusively in type&nbsp;I
collagen of bone

Both the cross-links are 
released into the circulation after mature tissue
collagen is degraded. They are not re-utilized or
metabolized in the liver but, instead, are excreted in the
urine unchanged, in peptide-bound and free forms. Neither
PYD or DPD are com&shy;monly measured

Cross-linked N&#8209;telopeptides (NTX) and C&#8209;telopeptides

resorption. C&#8209;telopeptides (CTX ) 
are better characterized than NTX and
are the preferred bone resorption marker, although both
have similar pro&shy;perties and origins. CTX is the reference
marker for bone resorption

 <h2>23a.9 Measurement of bone mineral con&shy;tent and bone
mineral density</h2>

Noninvasive techniques can be used to pro&shy;vide an indirect
assessment of calcium balance as well as calcium “stores”
in bone by measuring the bone mineral con&shy;tent (BMC) or
bone mineral density (BMD). These methods include dual
X&#8209;ray absorptiometry (DXA, also called DEXA) and
quantitative com&shy;puted tomography (QCT), both major
diagnostic tools for osteoporosis. Ultrasound (US),
although less accurate for medical diagnosis, can serve as a
tool for screening and for field work. These technologies
measure the mineral con&shy;tent of bone in the appendicular
skeleton, the axial skeleton, or the total skeleton,
measure&shy;ments that relate directly to the calcium con&shy;tent of
the skeleton. As almost all of the calcium in the body is
stored in the skeleton, it follows that skeletal mineral
con&shy;tent can be used as an indirect measure of body calcium
stores. These same methods can also be used to monitor the
response to changes in calcium intakes over relatively long
time periods, i.e., months or even years.
<p>
Over the past 40&nbsp;years technologies such as DXA and QCT
have been developed and refined to measure calcium in
hard tissues, and thus estimate of total body mineral
con&shy;tent, which in turn can be used to calculate total body
calcium. These technologies are also used to determine
bone integrity for the diagnosis of osteoporosis and other
bone diseases.  They can also be used during treatment to
evaluate efficacy as well as in research studies for the
development of new drugs, exercise regimens, or nutrition
interventions 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) (2020). ">
       (<a href="http://www.iofbonehealth.org"
     target="right" >IOF, 2020</a>).   </span>
<p>
The measure&shy;ment of bone mineral using DXA is usually
expressed as the bone mineral density, which corrects for
pro&shy;jected bone area. However, the measure&shy;ment is not a
true density measure&shy;ment, but instead, a&nbsp;measure of areal
density (g/cm<sup>2</sup>) derived by dividing 
bone mineral con&shy;tent&nbsp;(g) 
by the scanned bone area. Bone mineral density is
calculated in this way to reduce the bio&shy;logical variation
observed in values for bone mineral con&shy;tent at all ages and
thus to increase the statistical power of detecting abnormal
values. Nevertheless, bone mineral density does not
adequately correct for bone area and body size and thus
must be interpreted carefully

In con&shy;trast, QCT uses multiple slices to con&shy;struct 
three-dimensional images, thus pro&shy;viding a&nbsp;true volumetric
measure for BMD

<p>
Diagnosis for osteoporosis is based on the difference
between the measured bone mineral density (BMD) of the
participant and the mean BMD of healthy young adults,
matched for sex and ethnicity. The difference is expressed
relative to the young adult population standard deviation,
and reported as a&nbsp;T&#8209;score.

<h3>23a.9.1 Single-photon absorptiometry</h3>

Single-photon absorptiometry was the first practical
noninvasive method that was developed to examine the
peripheral skeleton

       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6623097"
     target="right" >Wahner et&nbsp;al., 1983</a>).</span>

although now it has mostly been replaced by DXA 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) (2020). ">
       (<a href="http://www.iofbonehealth.org"
     target="right" >IOF, 2020</a>).  </span>

The original method was based on the assumption that the bone
mineral con&shy;tent is inversely pro&shy;portional to the amount of
photon energy transmitted through the bone under study. A
mono-energetic photon source is used, usually <sup>125</sup>I or
<sup>241</sup>Am. The technique is fast, taking 
approximately 5min. With this method, bone mineral density is measured
with a&nbsp;precision (&percnt;CV) of less than 2&percnt; and with an
effective dose to the participant of only 0.1&micro;Sv.
The site most frequently selected for measure&shy;ments by
single-photon absorptiometry is the lower radius, at
approximately one-third of the distance from the styloid

Newer technologies have replaced SPA for human studies as SPA
cannot measure those sites (hip or spine) needed for clinical
diagnoses. In the past four decades SPA machines
have been adapted and used for animal studies of bone
health

<h3>23a.9.2 Dual X&#8209;ray absorptiometry (DXA)</h3>

The first com&shy;mercial DXA scanner was marketed in 1987.
There are now several com&shy;mercial versions, each using
similar measure&shy;ment pro&shy;cedures The original DXA method
used an isotopic source, typically  <sup>153</sup>Gd , that emitted
two  low-energy gamma rays at 44Kev and 100KeV. The short
half-life of the isotopic source <sup>153</sup>Gd, however, limited the
precision with which long-term changes in bone mineral
con&shy;tent in the same participant could be made using this
technique. This limitation led to the radioactive <sup>153</sup>Gd
source being replaced with an X&#8209;ray tube behind a&nbsp;K&#8209;edge
filter. The filter con&shy;verts the polychromatic X&#8209;ray beam
into one with two main energy peaks at 40Kev and 70KeV.
These two con&shy;gruent X&#8209;ray beams are passed through the
body, and the ratio of beam attenuation at the lower energy
relative to that at the higher energy differentiates between
bone mineral, bone-free mass, and the fat mass 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Kim HS, Jeong ES, Yang MH, Yang SO. (2018). Bone mineral density assessment for research purpose using dual energy X&#8209;ray absorptiometry. Osteoporosis and Sarcopenia 4(3):79-85.">

     target="right" >Kim et&nbsp;al., 2018</a>).</span>

As a&nbsp;result, this modified instrument is termed a
dual energy X&#8209;ray absorptiometer, abbreviated as DXA (or DEXA).
<p>
The DXA instrument is used not only for bone mineral
measures but also to assess body com&shy;position, as described
in Chapter 14. Only the measure&shy;ments of bone mineral
mass (g), bone mineral con&shy;tent  (g/cm),  and  “areal”  bone
mineral density (g/cm<sup>2</sup>) are discussed here. Using DXA,
measure&shy;ments of areal bone mass density (aBMD) can be
made at the lumbar spine, femur, and forearm, as well as
total body. Measurements of body mineral density at the
lumbar vertebrae (L2 to L4) are often favored because they
are sensitive to the changes associated with aging, disease,
and therapy. Care must be taken when positioning the
participant for the scan to ensure that precise and accurate
data are obtained. Under some circumstances, it may be
appro&shy;priate to make a&nbsp;whole-body scan. This is quick,
taking from 3min to 35min, depending on the instrument
used and the age of the participant, and requires very little
cooperation from the participant. As a&nbsp;result, scans can be
readily performed on young children, the elderly, and even
persons who are sick, although pregnant women should be
excluded

<p>
Dual-energy X&#8209;ray absorptiometry is now the dominant
method for measuring bone loss for clinical diagnosis of
osteopenia and osteoporosis. In intervention studies care
must be taken to ensure that both the length of the
intervention and the size of the study population are
sufficient to allow the detection of small changes in bone
mineral density. A meta-analysis of trials reported that
increasing calcium intake from dietary sources increased
BMD by 
<span class="n">0.6&ndash;1.0&percnt;</span> at the 
total hip and total body at one
year, and by 
<span class="n">0.7&ndash;1.8&percnt;</span> at 
these sites and the lumbar spine
and femoral neck at two&nbsp;years

       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26420598"
     target="right" >Tai et&nbsp;al., 2015</a>).</span>

Larger decreases in bone loss have been observed after treatment
with estrogen, calcitonin, or biphosphates.
<p>
When com&shy;paring measure&shy;ments using DXA based on
different instruments and technologies, it is important to
acknowledge the potential for systematic differences
arising from methodological factors which could mask
those associated with bio&shy;logical variation. Methodological
factors may include differences in instrument calibration
methods, whereas variations in body thickness, distribution
of body fat, and the fat con&shy;tent of the bone marrow are
major sources of bio&shy;logical variation.  Of the latter, DXA is
especially sensitive to discrepancies in body thickness,
which can lead to systematic differences in the bone
mineral estimates on thin and obese subjects.
In a&nbsp;global survey of fracture liaison services, although
access to DXA was reported to meet the needs 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Clynes MA, Westbury LD, Dennison EM, Kanis JA, Javaid MK, Harvey NC, Fujita M, Cooper C, Leslie WD, Shuhart CR; International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) and the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF).

only around 50&percnt; of institutions con&shy;firmed
adherence to basic DXA quality and reporting
pro&shy;cedures, and many required educating the
operators/interpreters. Indeed, significant variability
worldwide in both the quality and access to DXA
services was reported in this survey.
<p>
Calcium balance using DXA may be determined by
obtaining a&nbsp;total body (TB) DXA scan that pro&shy;vides bone
mineral con&shy;tent (BMC).  Scans of total body bone mineral
con&shy;tent (TBBMC) can be used to calculate calcium
requirements of specific life cycle groups, on the
assumption that bone mineral is 32·2&percnt; calcium

     target="right" >Vatanparast et&nbsp;al., 2010</a>).</span>

Use of this value is a&nbsp;better
approximation of calcium in bone than simply dividing the
atomic weight of calcium (40g/mol) by the molecular
weight (i.e., 1005g/mol) of hydroxyapatite
Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> 
because the mineral in bone is hydrated
so water molecules con&shy;tribute to the weight of bone
mineral con&shy;tent.

Estimates of calcium losses via urine, feces, and sweat
were derived from metabolic balance studies to which was
added the calcium accrued as bone mineral for growth
(derived from TBBMC).  The latter was measured in a
cohort of Canadian males and females in two age groups,
<span class="n">9&ndash;13y</span> and

To translate the physiological requirements for
absorbed calcium (from the factorial approach) into the
EAR, it is necessary to take into account the pro&shy;portion of
calcium in the habitual diet that is absorbed by the
intestine. Assuming an efficiency of absorption of 38&percnt;
from an omnivorous diet, the equation used for the
estimated Ca dietary requirement (i.e., the EAR) using the
formula for adolescence which is a&nbsp;period of rapid growth:<br/>
EAR&nbsp;&equals;&nbsp;Ca losses&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;(Ca needs for growth / 38&percnt;)<br/>

<h3>23a.9.3 Com&shy;puterized tomography (CT) and
peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT)</h3>
Computerized tomography (CT), often called quantitative
CT (QCT) when referring to bone measure&shy;ments, can be
used to measure bone mass of both the appendicular and
axial skeleton, although the method is not feasible for
population studies. The advantage of QCT is that a&nbsp;true
three-dimensional (i.e., volumetric) bone density can be
obtained, so results can be expressed in g/cm<sup>3</sup> rather than
the two-dimensional areal density measured by DXA.
Bone can also be identified as cortical or trabecular in
nature on the basis of bone density measure&shy;ments. This is
an advantage because some forms of osteoporosis are
predominantly trabecular in character. The equipment is not
portable, and the radiation dose required per slice for
imaging is relatively high <span class="n">(50&ndash;500&micro;Sv),</span> although it can be
reduced if scans are limited to regions of specific interest.
The cost of the equipment and its main&shy;tenance is high.
 <p>
The use of QCT technology applied to specific bone sites
yields information about micro&shy;architecture. Methods that
can be used include micro&#8209;CT and peripheral Quantitative
CT (pQCT), with the latter having widespread use. The
equipment for pQCT is small relative to DXA and CT, and
pro&shy;vides imaging of both the arm at the distal radius and
the lower leg (tibia) sites to assess bone micro&shy;architecture.
High-Resolution pQCT (HR&#8209;pQCT) has been developed to
improve the resolution pro&shy;blems of pQCT. Recently,
second-generation HrpQCT has been introduced which
differs from the first-generation HR&#8209;pQCT in scan region,
resolution, and morphological measure&shy;ment techniques

<h3>23a.9.4 Quantitative ultrasound</h3>

Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) is used for measure&shy;ments of
the bone density of the peripheral skeleton such as the
proximal arm (radius), lower leg (tibia) or heel. A wide
variety of equipment is now available to measure the
attenuation of a&nbsp;sonographic pulse as it passes through bone
and is scattered and absorbed by the trabeculae. The heel is
the most frequently used measure&shy;ment site because it has a
large volume of trabecular bone that is accessible for
transmission measure&shy;ments. However, there are ultrasound
machines on the market that measure multiple skeletal
sites. Quantitative Ultrasound has the advantage of being
radiation-free and a&nbsp;portable system.
<p>
Quantitative ultrasound measures the speed of sound (SoS)
in meters per second (m/s). In a&nbsp;study of different age
groups using QUS, measures of SoS (m/s) varied according
to life stages that reflected bone development 

 <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Rivas-Ruiz R, Clark P, Talavera JO, Huitrón G, Tamayo JA, Salmerón J. (2015). Bone speed of sound throughout lifetime assessed with quantitative ultrasound in a&nbsp;Mexican population. Journal of Clinical Densitometry 18:68-75.">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565831"
     target="right" >Rivas-Ruiz et&nbsp;al., 2015</a>).</span>
	 
For example, bone SoS accretion was found to
begin 5y earlier in girls than 
boys (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), a&nbsp;sex-related 
difference that mirrors results seen in DXA scans

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Vatanparast H, Bailey DA, Baxter-Jones AD, Whiting SJ. (2010). Calcium requirements for bone growth in Canadian boys and girls during adolescence. British Journal of Nutrition 103:575-580">
       (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19852873."
     target="right" >Vatanparast et&nbsp;al., 2010</a>).</span>

The maximal (peak bone) SoS
was noted at 28y at the radius site and at
22y at the tibia site. Women who were
postmenopausal (age <span class="n">45&ndash;50y)</span> showed a&nbsp;significant
decrease in SoS measures at both these sites (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05)
compared with men, as would be expected. Thus, while the
precision of QUS is poor relative to DXA, the equipment
may be suitable for characterizing bone in populations
where DXA is not a&nbsp;feasible option. However, QUS has no
clinical applications and is not used to define T&#8209;scores for
diagnosing osteoporosis or monitoring treatment. However,
a systematic review has shown that quantitative ultrasound
is an independent predictor of fracture for men and women
when QUS values are low
