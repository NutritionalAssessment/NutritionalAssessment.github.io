Quantitative methods for measuring food con&shy;sump&shy;tion of indi&shy;viduals 
consist of 24h&nbsp;
recalls or estimated or weighed food records. These measure actual intakes for 
indi&shy;viduals over one day, or by increasing the number of measurement days, usual 
intakes of foods and nutrients. For retrospective inform&shy;ation on usual intakes of 
foods or nutrients over a&nbsp;longer time period, a&nbsp;dietary history or food fre&shy;quency 
question&shy;naire (FFQ) can be used. Each method has advantages and limitations. 
<p>
Technical improvements for measuring dietary intakes of indi&shy;viduals include 
telephone-assisted inter&shy;views, graduated portion-size photo&shy;graphs printed or 
digitally displayed. Web-based inter&shy;viewer or self-admin&shy;istered 
24h&nbsp;recalls that 
stan&shy;dardize the inter&shy;view and data entry are being used in national food 
consumption surveys. For low-income coun&shy;tries, 24h&nbsp;recall data can be collected 
off-line using a&nbsp;mobile application and linked to a&nbsp;web data&shy;based application 
allowing access to food composition data.  Several image-based methods utilizing 
camera-enabled cellular phones or smartphones, digital, wearable or digital video 
cameras are being tested, some relying on active image capture by users and 
others on passive image capture whereby pictures are taken automatically. Under 
development are wearable devices which objectively measure diet without relying 
on user-reported food intake.
<p>
Selection of the appropriate dietary method depends primarily on the study objectives. 
For average usual intake of a&nbsp;group, a&nbsp;single 24h&nbsp;recall or record is appropriate, 
whereas for the prevalence of inadequate intakes, replicate observations on each 
indi&shy;vidual or at least a&nbsp;representative sub&shy;sample are required. For assessing 
usual nutrient intakes for ranking within a&nbsp;group, multiple 
replicates of 24h&nbsp;recalls 
or 1d food records are essential, with an even larger number per indi&shy;vidual for diet 
counselling, corre&shy;la&shy;tion  or regression analysis.  The number, selection, and 
spacing of the days depends on the  within-in person day-to-day vari&shy;a&shy;tion  of the 
nutrient of inter&shy;est and level of precision required. 
Alter&shy;natively, a&nbsp;semi-quanti&shy;tative 
food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire or dietary history can provide data on usual nutrient 
intakes for ranking or diet counselling etc.

<h2>3.1 Methods for measuring food con&shy;sump&shy;tion of indi&shy;viduals</h2>

This chapter describes methods commonly used for measuring
the food con&shy;sump&shy;tion of indi&shy;viduals. Subsequent chapters
discuss the factors associated with the reproducibility and
validity of each of these methods (Chapters 5&#8209;7) and the
calcu&shy;lation and, subse&shy;quently, evaluation of nutrient intakes (Chapters&nbsp;4
and&nbsp;8b).
<p>
Two groups of methods are used to measure the
food con&shy;sump&shy;tion of indi&shy;viduals. The first group, known as
quanti&shy;tative daily con&shy;sump&shy;tion methods, consists of recalls
or records designed to measure the quantity of the
indi&shy;vidual foods con&shy;sumed over a&nbsp;one&nbsp;day period. By increasing
the number of measurement days, quanti&shy;tative esti&shy;mates of
the usual intakes of indi&shy;viduals can be obtained, using the
same methods. The number, selection, and spacing of the
days depend on the food intake, the nutrients of inter&shy;est,
the day-to-day vari&shy;a&shy;tion  in nutrient intake, and the level
of precision required. Determination of the usual intake of
indi&shy;vid&shy;uals is partic&shy;ularly critical when relationships between diet and
biological parameters or health or chronic disease are assessed.
Estimates of usual intakes of indi&shy;vid&shy;uals in a&nbsp;group or popu&shy;lation
are also needed to estimate the
prevalence of inadequate intakes.
<p>
The second group of
methods includes the dietary history and the food fre&shy;quency
question&shy;naire. Both obtain retrospective inform&shy;ation on the
patterns of food use during a&nbsp;longer, less precisely defined
time period. Such methods can be used to assess the usual
intake of foods or specific classes of foods. With  modifi&shy;cation , 
they can also provide data on usual nutrient intakes of indi&shy;viduals.
<p>
Quantitative daily con&shy;sump&shy;tion methods such as
24h&nbsp;recalls and records, when adjusted appropriately
statis&shy;tically to assess usual intakes, provide less-biased 
esti&shy;mates of dietary intake than those
such as food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naires and dietary histories
that are designed to generate data on usual intakes directly
<span data-tippy-content="Dunn, B. K., Ghosh, S., & Kramer, B. S. (2015). JNCI and cancer prevention. Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 107(3), djv021.  ">

target="right" >National Cancer Institute, 2015</a>). </span> 
<p>
The measurement of food
con&shy;sump&shy;tion at the indi&shy;vidual level is costly and time
consuming. Hence, such studies should be planned with care
<span data-tippy-content="Thompson, F. E., Kirkpatrick, S. I., Subar, A. F., Reedy, J., Schap, T. E., Wilson, M. M., & Krebs-Smith, S. M. (2015).

target="right" >Thompson et&nbsp;al., 2015</a>). </span> 
Even with the advent of new
technologies to measure dietary intakes (Section&nbsp;3.2),
challenges still remain. Consid&shy;eration should be given to
the cost-effective collection of additional data from the
same indi&shy;viduals at the same time; such additional
inform&shy;ation may significantly enhance the inter&shy;pretation of
the dietary data. At a&nbsp;minimum, socioeconomic and
health-related inform&shy;ation, simple anthropometric measures,
possibly a&nbsp;physical activity question&shy;naire, and biological
samples for the determination of important biomarkers
(Chapter 15) should be collected when time and resources
permit

of the food intake of infants is partic&shy;ularly difficult,

milk and complementary foods

nutrient intakes of breastfed infants receiving
complementary foods.

<h3>3.1.1 Twenty-four-hour recall method</h3>

In the 24h&nbsp;recall method, the respon&shy;dent and, where
necessary, their parents or caretakers are asked by the
nutritionist, who has been trained in inter&shy;viewing
tech&shy;niques, to recall the respon&shy;dent's exact food intake
during the previous 24h&nbsp;period or preceding day. Thus the
method assesses the actual intake of indi&shy;viduals. However,
a single 24h&nbsp;recall is not sufficient to describe an
indi&shy;vidual's <i>usual</i> intake of food and nutrients; multiple
24h&nbsp;recalls on the same indi&shy;vidual over several days are
required to achieve this objective (Section&nbsp;3.1.2).
Nevertheless, multiple single-day recalls on dif&shy;fer&shy;ent
indi&shy;viduals can give a&nbsp;valid measure of the usual intake of a
group or popu&shy;lation (Section&nbsp;3.3.1).
<p></p>
A multiple-pass inter&shy;viewing tech&shy;nique is recommended for
the 24h&nbsp;recall methods. The USDA has devel&shy;oped an automated 
multiple-pass method (AMPM) consisting of five steps to
collect dietary data using the
24h&nbsp;recall method; these five steps are shown in

The AMPM is used by the US&nbsp;in the National
Health and Nutrition Examin&shy;ation Surveys (NHANES).
Branded food products have now been added to the
NHANES generic data&shy;base to facilitate easier
selection of foods con&shy;sumed by the participants.
<p>
The first step in the AMPM is the Quick
List where respon&shy;dents list all food con&shy;sumed in the
previous 24h&nbsp;period. The second step, called Forgotten
Foods, includes a&nbsp;series of questions that probes for
categories of foods that are commonly
forgotten. The third step, Time &amp; Occasion, collects the
time each food was eaten and the name of the eating
occasion. The fourth step is the Detail Cycle which elicits
descrip&shy;tions of foods and amounts eaten, aided by the
inter&shy;active use of the USDA Food Model Booklet and measuring
guide

<span data-tippy-content="USDA Food Model Booklet and measuring guides&nbsp;(2002+)">
(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/measuring_guides_dri/2002/fmb.htm" >USDA 
2002+</a>)</span>; 

see Chapter 5
for more details. The Detail Cycle also includes
questions that review each eating occasion and each inter&shy;val
between eating occasions. The fifth step is a&nbsp;final review
question, the Final Probe, which provides the respon&shy;dent a
final opportunity to recall any foods that had not been
reported previously during the inter&shy;view. The
AMPM has been validated by comparing reported energy intake
in young children with total energy expenditure assessed
using the doubly labeled water method

A  modifi&shy;cation  of the multiple-pass 24h&nbsp;recall consisting
of four passes &mdash; termed an interactive 
24h&nbsp;recall &mdash; has been devel&shy;oped to collect information
on rural popu&shy;lations in low- and middle-income coun&shy;tries; 
details are given in the
technical monograph by Gibson and Ferguson

<p></p>
<b>In the first pass</b> a&nbsp;complete list of all the foods and
bever&shy;ages con&shy;sumed during the preceding day is obtained.
<p><b>
In the second pass,</b>  a&nbsp;detailed descrip&shy;tion of
each food and beverage con&shy;sumed, including cooking methods
and brand names (if possible) is collected. Standardized probe
questions, specific for the popu&shy;lation subgroup and setting,
should be used to elicit specific details for each food
item. For example, for milk products, probe questions
should include the kind of dairy product, brand name (if
appropriate), and percentage fat (as butterfat or milk fat).
Further examples of probes that can be used to obtain
detailed descrip&shy;tions of specified foods are also provided
in the monograph.
<p>
<b>In the third pass,</b> esti&shy;mates of the amount of each food and
beverage item con&shy;sumed are obtained, generally in house&shy;hold
measures, and entered either on the data sheet 

<a href="appendix/app3-1.htm" target="_blank"> Appendix&nbsp;3.1 </a>

or a&nbsp;computer-based data-entry form. Care must be taken to
record whether any fortified foods or bever&shy;ages have been

Whenever possible, recall inter&shy;views in rural settings 
in low and middle-income coun&shy;tries should be conducted in
the respon&shy;dent's home, because the familiar environment
encourages partic&shy;ipation, improves the recall of foods
con&shy;sumed, and facilitates calibration of local house&shy;hold
utensils by the inter&shy;viewer.
For a review of potential measurement errors using self-reported 24h recalls in  
low-income coun&shy;tries  and strategies for their prevention, see Gibson et&nbsp;al.

However, major challenges arise when assessing food
con&shy;sump&shy;tion at the indi&shy;vidual level in coun&shy;tries or cultures
where the majority of the food con&shy;sumed is as shared plate
eating. Strategies used to overcome some of these challenges 
are reviewed by <span data-tippy-content="Burrows, T., Collins, C., Adam, M., Duncanson, K., & Rollo, M. (2019). Dietary Assessment of Shared Plate Eating: A Missing Link.

<p>
A major advantage of a&nbsp;24h&nbsp;recall is that the respon&shy;dent
burden is small so that compliance is generally high. In addition, the method
is quick and relatively inexpensive, and can be used equally well
with both literate and illiterate respon&shy;dents. Nevertheless, any
24h&nbsp;inter&shy;view protocol must be stan&shy;dardized, 
pretested,and then piloted prior to use. Standardization is
partic&shy;ularly important in large-scale national surveys and
for compar&shy;isons across coun&shy;tries

Adherence to the inter&shy;view
protocol and accuracy of food coding by the inter&shy;viewers
should be checked periodically during the survey, and the
inter&shy;viewers must be retrained if required to minimize
inter&shy;viewer bias (Chapter 5). Detailed sugges&shy;tions on
how to conduct the inter&shy;view can be found in Hughes
<span data-tippy-content="Hughes BA. (1986). Nutrition inter&shy;viewing and counselling in public health: the North Carolina experience. Topics in Clinical Nutrition 1: 43&ndash;50.">(<a href="https://journals.lww.com/topicsinclinicalnutrition/citation/1986/01000/nutrition_inter&shy;viewing_and_counseling_in_public.7.aspx" target="right" >1986</a>) </span> 

who stressed that leading questions and
judgmental comments should be avoided. An indi&shy;rect approach
employing open-ended questions is recommended. This enables
respon&shy;dents to freely express their feelings so that answers
are not biased. Piloting should be undertaken in an area
near the study site, using respon&shy;dents similar to those who
will partic&shy;ipate in the actual study.
<p>
When 24h&nbsp;recalls are
used to characterize the average usual intake of a
popu&shy;lation group, the respon&shy;dents should be representative
of the popu&shy;lation under study. In addition, the survey
should be conducted in such a&nbsp;way that all days of the week
are equally repre&shy;sented. In this way, any day-of-the-week
effects on food or nutrient intakes will be taken into
account  (Chapter 6). Seasonality must also be
consid&shy;ered as it affects food availability.

Intake.org has provided technical assistance to support national or large-scale dietary 
surveys in Ethiopia, Jordan, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Viet Nam, and Zambia.
The AMPR method, used in the US NHANES&nbsp;III, has been adapted for use
by both the Canadian and Australian national health surveys.
<p>
The US National Cancer Institute have devel&shy;oped an Automated
Self-Administered 24h&nbsp;recall (ASA24) based on the US&nbsp;AMPR
method which is suitable for large-scale epi&shy;demio&shy;logical
studies

Overall partic&shy;ipants were
receptive to completing ASA24, although the ASA24 inter&shy;face
and the steps in completing the recalls were not necessarily
intuitive, espe&shy;cially for younger children and elderly
adults. The inves&shy;tigators emphasized the importance of
piloting protocols using online tools and the potential need
for tailored resources to support certain age groups.
<p>
In general, recall inter&shy;views can be conducted on children
aged &gt;&nbsp;12y
<span data-tippy-content="Deitchler M, Arimond M, Carriquiry A, Hotz C, Tooze JA. (2020). Planning and Design Consid&shy;erations for Quantitative 24-Hour Recall Dietary Surveys in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. Intake Center for Dietary Assessment/FHI Solutions, Washington. DC.">(<a href="https://www.intake.org/index.php/resource/planning-and-design-considerations-quantitative-24-hour-recall-dietary-surveys-low-and" target="right" >Deitchler et&nbsp;al., 2020</a>), </span> 
and on most adults,
except for persons with poor memories (e.g., some elderly).
Parents are typically relied upon as proxy reporters for
capturing dietary intake for children under five years of
age. Children aged from 
<span class="n">5&ndash;12y</span>  should be inter&shy;viewed
along with their primary caretaker, usually the mother, an
approach termed assisted reporting. It may be necessary to
inter&shy;view several people if the children are at school,
day-care, or play in the homes of friends, to ensure that
all foods eaten away from home are reported. Recipe data for
school or day-care meals may be required to supplement the food
intake data collected in the home. In a&nbsp;study of Canadian
preschool children 
<span class="n">2&ndash;5y</span>  in which parents used the online
self-admin&shy;istered 24h&nbsp;recall (ASA24), they were able to
report the food and bever&shy;ages that their child had con&shy;sumed
with reasonable accuracy but the accuracy of portion size
esti&shy;mates was low 
<span data-tippy-content="Wallace, A., Kirkpatrick, S. I., Darlington, G., & Haines, J. (2018).

<p>
In the end, the success of the 24h&nbsp;recall, irrespe&shy;ctive of
the method applied, depends on the respon&shy;dent's memory,
their ability to convey accurate esti&shy;mates of portion sizes
con&shy;sumed, the degree of motivation of the respon&shy;dent, and
the persistence of the inter&shy;viewer

<h3>3.1.2 Repeated 24h&nbsp;recalls</h3>

Twenty-four-hour recalls can be repeated to estimate the average food intake of
indi&shy;viduals over a&nbsp;longer time period (i.e., usual food
intake). The number of 24h&nbsp;recalls required to estimate
the usual nutrient intake of indi&shy;viduals depends on the
day-to-day vari&shy;a&shy;tion  in food intake within one indi&shy;vidual
(i.e., within-person vari&shy;a&shy;tion ). In turn, this vari&shy;a&shy;tion  is
affected by the nutrient under study, the study popu&shy;lation,
and seasonal vari&shy;a&shy;tions in intake.
<p>
Repeated 24h&nbsp;recalls were recommended as part of a&nbsp;system
for measuring food con&shy;sump&shy;tion patterns in the United States
to account for within-person variability as early as 1981
<span data-tippy-content="NRC (National Research Council). (1981). The proposed system.

National Academy Press, Washington, DC., pp. 13&ndash;18">(<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/380/chapter/1" target="right" >NRC, 1981</a>). </span> 
In the US&nbsp;NHANES 
<span class="n">2011&ndash;2014,</span>  food intakes on
two non-consecutive days were recorded, on the first day through using
computer-assisted personal recall inter&shy;views (CAPI), and on the 
second day via a&nbsp;computer-assisted systematic telephone inter&shy;view (CATI),
using the AMPR on both occasions 
<span data-tippy-content="Amoutzopoulos, B., Page, P., Roberts, C., Roe, M., Cade, J., Steer, T., Baker, R., Hawes, T., Galloway, C., Yu, D., & Almiron-Roig, E. (2020).

The second recall inter&shy;views were not conducted on
all respon&shy;dents, but instead were repeated on a&nbsp;randomly
selected sub&shy;sample of the popu&shy;lation. Tooze
<span data-tippy-content="Tooze JA. (2020). Estimating usual intakes from dietary surveys: methodologic challenges, analysis, approaches and recommendations for low- and middle-income coun&shy;tries.

recommends that the repeated 24h&nbsp;recalls should be
performed on non-consecutive days 
<span class="n">3&ndash;10d</span>  apart, and when
only a&nbsp;random sub&shy;sample of the popu&shy;lation is used, repeated
on at least 50 indi&shy;viduals per stratum. Moreover, when 
episod&shy;ically con&shy;sumed 
foods, food groups or nutrients are of partic&shy;ular inter&shy;est, 
then more replicates per person should be collected rather
than increasing the sample size from which two replicates are obtained

<h4>Estimated food records</h4>

For the estimated food record, also referred to as a&nbsp;food
diary by some researchers, the respon&shy;dent is asked to
record in house&shy;hold measures, at the time
of con&shy;sump&shy;tion, all foods and bever&shy;ages eaten
(including snacks), for a
specified time period. Detailed descrip&shy;tions of all foods
and bever&shy;ages (including brand names) and their method of
preparation and cooking should also be recorded. For mixed dishes
such as Spaghetti Bolognese, the amount of each raw
ingredient used in the recipe, the final weight of the mixed
dish, and the amount con&shy;sumed by the respon&shy;dent should be
recorded, wherever possible. The inform&shy;ation is recorded on
a form similar to that shown in 
<a href="appendix/app3-1.htm" target="_blank"> Appendix&nbsp;3-1 </a>,
 except that
house&shy;hold measures are used for food amounts. Usually, the
respon&shy;dent, parent, or caretaker completes the food record,
although in low or middle-income coun&shy;tries a&nbsp;local field
inves&shy;tigator may perform this task
<span data-tippy-content="Dufour, D. L., Staten, L. K., Waslien, C. I., Reina, J. C., & Spurr, G. B. (1999). Estimating energy intake of urban women in Colombia: compar&shy;ison of diet records and recalls. American journal of physical anthropology, 108(1), 53&ndash;63.">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9915301" target="right" >Dufour et&nbsp;al., 1999</a>). </span> 
Reactivity, defined as a&nbsp;change in behavior due to awareness
that behavior is being or will be measured, may be an issue
with this method. The respon&shy;dent has the opportunity to
modify his or her &ldquo;usual&rdquo; diet, potentially in a&nbsp;more
socially desirable manner or to simplify the recording task
<span data-tippy-content="Thompson, F. E., Kirkpatrick, S. I., Subar, A. F., Reedy, J., Schap, T. E., Wilson, M. M., & Krebs-Smith, S. M. (2015).

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26422452"
target="right" >Thompson et&nbsp;al., 2015</a>) </span> 
(Chapter 5).
<p>
Food portion sizes can be estimated by the respon&shy;dent in a
variety of ways. Standard house&shy;hold measuring cups and
spoons should be used if possible, supplemented by
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments with a&nbsp;ruler (for meat and cake) and counts
(for eggs and bread slices). Unfor&shy;tu&shy;nately, errors may
arise because the respon&shy;dent may fail to quantify portion
sizes correctly. Additional errors may also arise during
the conversion of volumes to weights (Chapter 5), although this
latter step is usually completed by the inves&shy;tigator.
Details on how to convert portion sizes to weight
equiv&shy;alents are given in Gibson and Ferguson
<span data-tippy-content="Gibson RS, Ferguson EL. (2008). An Interactive 24-Hour Recall for Assessing the Adequacy of Iron and Zinc Intakes in Developing Countries. HarvestPlus Technical Monograph 8.

<p></p>
The number of days included in an estimated record varies,
depending on the study objective. When the objective is to
obtain an average intake for a&nbsp;group, then only one day per
person is required, provided all days of the week are
equally repre&shy;sented in the final sample. However, when
esti&shy;mates of usual intakes of each person are required, then
the number, selection, and spacing of the days required per
person depends on the factors described for the repeated
24h&nbsp;recall (Section&nbsp;3.1.2). Weekend days should always be
proportionately included in the dietary survey period for
each person, to account for potential day-of-the-week
effects on food and nutrient intakes. This problem is
discussed in more detail in Chapter&nbsp;6.
<p>
The European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)
study in Norfolk, U.K. collected food and nutrient intakes
from 2117 men and women using a&nbsp;7d estimated food diary.
EPIC was a&nbsp;large multicenter prospective study aimed at
investigating the relationship between nutrition and various
life-style factors and the etiology of cancer and other
chronic diseases. The study involved 23 regional centers
located in ten coun&shy;tries, and involved a&nbsp;total cohort of
about 480,000 subjects. The respon&shy;dents of the EPIC study
in Norfolk were provided with a&nbsp;&ldquo;diet diary&rdquo; &mdash; a&nbsp;45-page
colored booklet in which they were asked to record the
descrip&shy;tion, preparation, and amounts of foods eaten over
seven consecutive days. Food portion sizes were estimated
by the respon&shy;dents in terms of house&shy;hold measures, with the
help of 17 sets of color photographs of small, medium, and
large portions of the dif&shy;fer&shy;ent foods.

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870026" target="right" >Ashwell et&nbsp;al., 2006</a>), </span>
seven-day weighed food records were used.
However, when the rolling program was introduced in 2008,
the seven-day weighed food records were replaced by a&nbsp;four-day
estimated food diary due to concerns about respon&shy;dent
burden.
<p>
A weighed food record is the most precise method available
for estimating usual food and nutrient intakes of
indi&shy;viduals. It is the preferred method when diet
counseling or corre&shy;la&shy;tion  of intakes with biological
parameters are involved. In a&nbsp;weighed record, the subject,
parent, or caretaker is instructed to weigh all foods and
bever&shy;ages con&shy;sumed by the subject during a&nbsp;specified time
period. Details of methods of food preparation, descrip&shy;tion
of foods, and brand names (if known) should also be
recorded. For mixed dishes such as Spaghetti Bolognese, the
weight of the portion con&shy;sumed should be recorded, along
with the weights and descrip&shy;tion of all the raw ingredients,
including flavors and spices used in the recipe, as well as
the final total weight of the mixed dish. The method of
recording is similar to that shown 
for a&nbsp;24h&nbsp;recall (Table&nbsp;3.1), 
with the weight of the food items being recorded under
"Amount."
<p>
If occasional meals are eaten away from home, respon&shy;dents
are generally requested to record descrip&shy;tions of the
amounts of food eaten. The nutritionist can then buy and
weigh a&nbsp;duplicate portion of each recorded food item, where
possible, to assess the prob&shy;able weight con&shy;sumed.
Alter&shy;natively, if appropriate, the nutritionist can
telephone a&nbsp;restaurant to obtain details of the portion
sizes con&shy;sumed.
<p>
As with the estimated record, the number, spacing, and
selection of days necessary to characterize the usual
nutrient intakes of an indi&shy;vidual using the weighed record
depend on the within-person vari&shy;a&shy;tion  in food intake, which,
in turn, depends on the nutrient of inter&shy;est, the study
popu&shy;lation, and any seasonal vari&shy;a&shy;tion  of intake. Again,
week-end days should be proportionately included to account
for any weekend effect on the nutrient intake. If a&nbsp;weighed
food record method is to be used, respon&shy;dents must be
motivated, numerate, and literate. Reactivity may be an
issue with this method, and inter&shy;fere with the assessment of
usual dietary intake. Respondents may change their usual
eating pattern to simplify the weighing process or,
alternatively, to impress the inves&shy;tigator

(Chapter 7). In addition, respon&shy;dent burden for a&nbsp;weighed food record is
higher than for an estimated record or for a&nbsp;24h&nbsp;recall, so
indi&shy;viduals may be less willing to cooperate.
Reproducibility, however, is greater in the weighed record
than in the estimated record method because the portion
sizes are weighed, although significant underreporting
(Chapter 5) may still occur.

<h3>3.1.3 Dietary history</h3>

The dietary history method
<span data-tippy-content="Burke BS. (1947). The dietary history as a&nbsp;tool in research. Journal of the American Dietetic Association 23: 1041&ndash;1046.">(<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002822321439490" target="right" >Burke, 1947</a>) </span> 

attempts to estimate the usual food intake and meal pattern of
indi&shy;viduals over a&nbsp;relatively long period of time &mdash; often a
month. This inter&shy;view method was originally designed to be
carried out by a&nbsp;nutritionist trained in inter&shy;viewing
tech&shy;niques. More recently, computerized versions have been
devel&shy;oped which provide stan&shy;dardized methods for data
collection and probing, and minimize potential inter&shy;viewer
bias in responses
<span data-tippy-content="Kohlmeier, L., Mendez, M., McDuffie, J., & Miller, M. (1997). Computer-assisted self-inter&shy;viewing: a&nbsp;multimedia approach to dietary assessment. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 65(4 Suppl), 1275S–1281S. ">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9094933" target="right" >Kohlmeier et&nbsp;al., 1997</a>). </span> 
<p>
Initially, the dietary history had three components. The
first component was an inter&shy;view about the usual overall
eating pattern of the subject, both at mealtimes and between
meals. Such inform&shy;ation included detailed descrip&shy;tions of
foods, their fre&shy;quency of con&shy;sump&shy;tion, and usual portion
sizes in common house&shy;hold measures. &ldquo;What do you usually
eat for breakfast?&rdquo; is a&nbsp;typical question that might have
been included in the inter&shy;view.
<p>
The second component served as a&nbsp;crosscheck and consisted of
a question&shy;naire on the fre&shy;quency of con&shy;sump&shy;tion of specific
food items. This part was used to verify and clarify the
inform&shy;ation on the kinds and amounts of foods given as the
usual intake in the first component. Questions asked
related to specific foods, such as: "Do you like or dislike
milk." A 24h&nbsp;recall of actual intake may also have been
included at this stage.
<p>
In the third component, subjects recorded their food intake
at home for three days. Portion sizes at this stage were
estimated using a&nbsp;variety of tech&shy;niques, including stan&shy;dard
measuring cups and spoons, common utensils, commercial
plastic food models, photo&shy;graphs, or real foods. Today, the
original dietary history method is seldom used in this
three-part format, the third component being commonly omitted.
<p>
The time periods covered by the dietary history method vary.
The maximum time period that can be used has not been
definitely established. When shorter time frames (i.e., one
month) are used, reproducibility and validity are apparently
higher than for longer periods (see Chapter 7).
Measurements of food intake over one-year periods are prob&shy;ably
unrealistic unless seasonal vari&shy;a&shy;tions in food intakes are
taken into account.
<p>
Dutch inves&shy;tigators used a&nbsp;three-part dietary history method
covering one month to record usual food con&shy;sump&shy;tion on
weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays separately
<span data-tippy-content="van Staveren, W. A., de Boer, J. O., & Burema, J. (1985). Validity and reproducibility of a&nbsp;dietary history method estimating the usual food intake during one month. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 42(3), 554–559. ">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4036852" target="right" >van Staveren et&nbsp;al., 1985</a>). </span> 
This approach takes into account the potential
effect of weekends on nutrient intake. The portion size of
foods most frequently con&shy;sumed in this study were weighed by
a dietitian in the home. A weighted daily average intake
was then calculated from the data, using the following
formula: 
</p>
\[\small ((5 &times; \mbox{Weekday}) + \mbox{Saturday} + \mbox{Sunday})  /  7 \]
<p>
A modified version of this dietary history method was
adopted in the Survey in Europe on Nutrition in the Elderly:
A Concerted Action (SENECA). This multicenter survey was
designed to examine cross-cultural vari&shy;a&shy;tions in the
nutrition, lifestyle, health, and perform&shy;ance of elderly
Europeans
<span data-tippy-content="Euronut - SENECA. Nutrition and the elderly in Europe. 1st European Congress on Nutrition and Health in the Elderly. The Netherlands, December 1991. (1991).

The method involved the completion of a&nbsp;three-day estimated
record, followed by an inter&shy;view during which respon&shy;dents
were questioned about their usual dietary intake over the
past month. Portions of the most commonly eaten foods were
weighed by the inter&shy;viewer

<p>
The recording of a&nbsp;dietary history can be very labor
intensive, with inter&shy;views taking up to 2h per respon&shy;dent

Several inves&shy;tigators have
reported that the dietary history tends to overestimate
nutrient intakes, when compared with results from weighed
records. Nes et&nbsp;al. 
<span data-tippy-content="Nes, M., van Staveren, W. A., Zajkás, G., Inelmen, E. M., & Moreiras-Varela, O. (1991). Validity of the dietary history method in elderly subjects.

for example, used the dietary
history devel&shy;oped for the SENECA study and showed that the
method generated consistently higher intakes of energy and
nutrients than three-day weighed records. Livingstone and Robson 
<span data-tippy-content="Livingstone, M. B., & Robson, P. J. (2000). Measurement of dietary intake in children. The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 59(2), 279&ndash;293">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10946797" target="right" >2000</a>)</span> 
reported similar findi&shy;ngs in a&nbsp;study of
children and adolescents, but claimed that the results
obtained from the dietary history were more representative
of habitual intake than those obtained from seven-day weighed
records. In general, because dietary histories, unlike food
fre&shy;quency question&shy;naires, do not limit the variability in
the responses, they overcome many of the limitations of a
food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire. However, the absence of a
stan&shy;dardized format for the dietary history method limits
compar&shy;ison of its usefulness across studies

<h3>3.1.4 Food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire</h3>

The food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire, sometimes referred to as a
diet history question&shy;naire, aims to assess the usual
fre&shy;quency with which food items or food groups are con&shy;sumed
during a&nbsp;specified time period. It was originally designed
to provide descriptive qualitative inform&shy;ation about usual
food-con&shy;sump&shy;tion patterns. With the addition of
portion-size esti&shy;mates and the introduction of improved
computerized self-admin&shy;istered question&shy;naires, the method
has become semi-quanti&shy;tative, allowing the derivation of
energy and selected nutrient intakes
<span data-tippy-content="Willett, W. C., Sampson, L., Stampfer, M. J., Rosner, B., Bain, C., Witschi, J., Hennekens, C. H., & Speizer, F. E. (1985).

<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3740045" target="right" >Block et&nbsp;al., 1986</a>). </span> 
<p>
In its simplest form, the question&shy;naire consists of a&nbsp;list  
of foods and an associated set of frequency-of-use response
categories 

(<a href="appendix/app3-2.htm" target="_blank"> Appendix&nbsp;3-2 </a>).

The list of foods may focus on
specific groups of foods, partic&shy;ular foods, or foods
con&shy;sumed periodically in association with special events or
seasons. Alter&shy;natively, the food list may be extensive to
enable esti&shy;mates of total food intake and dietary diversity
to be made. The frequency-of-use response categories may be
daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, depending on the study
objective.
<p>
Specific combinations of foods can be used as predictors for
intakes of certain nutrients or non-nutrients, provided that
the dietary components are concen&shy;trated in a&nbsp;relatively
small number of foods or specific food groups. Examples
include the fre&shy;quency of con&shy;sump&shy;tion of fresh fruits and
fruit juices as predictors of vitamin&nbsp;C intake

<p>
The food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naires should feature simple,
well-defined foods and food categories. Open-ended
questions should be avoided as preformatted lists of food
categories act as a&nbsp;memory prompt. The method may use a
stan&shy;dardized inter&shy;view, a&nbsp;self-admin&shy;istered machine-readable
printed question&shy;naire, or a&nbsp;computer-admin&shy;istered
question&shy;naire. Most question&shy;naires usually list 80 to 120
indi&shy;vidual items and take from 
<span class="n">15&ndash;30</span>  minutes to complete (see
abbreviated example given in Appendix&nbsp;3.2). Hence, the food
fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire imposes less burden on respon&shy;dents
than most of the other dietary assess&shy;ment methods. The
results are easy to collect and process and are generally
taken to represent usual intakes over an extended period of
time, and hence are not affected by day-to-day variability.
As food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naires are designed to provide
retrospective inform&shy;ation about diet, they are often used in
retrospective case-control studies
<span data-tippy-content="Schink, M., Konturek, P. C., Herbert, S. L., Renner, S. P., Burghaus, S., Blum, S., Fasching, P. A., Neurath, M. F., & Zopf, Y. (2019).

derived a&nbsp;food list for a&nbsp;food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire with
portion sizes from the NHANES&nbsp;II results. Food items
selected were based on the fre&shy;quency of con&shy;sump&shy;tion of

significantly to the total popu&shy;lation intake of energy and
each of 17&nbsp;nutrients. Serving sizes were estimated from
observed portion size distri&shy;butions in the NHANES&nbsp;II data.
Medium serving sizes for each food were specified in the

In many low-income coun&shy;tries no national food con&shy;sump&shy;tion
surveys have been conducted so the key inform&shy;ation needed to

available. Such inform&shy;ation includes a&nbsp;listing of foods
commonly con&shy;sumed in the study popu&shy;lation, details on the

<div class="box"><b>Box 3.1 Uses and limitations of methods used to assess the food con&shy;sump&shy;tion of indi&shy;viduals.</b>	
<p>
<span class="topic">24h&nbsp;recall.</span>
Subject or caretaker recalls food
intake of previous 24h&nbsp;in an inter&shy;view. Quantities
estimated in house&shy;hold measures using
food models as memory aids or to assist
in quantifying portion sizes. Nutrient intakes
calculated using food composition data.
<ul> <li><span class="topic">Uses and Limitations</span>
Useful for assessing average usual intakes of a&nbsp;large popu&shy;lation, provided
that the sample is truly representative and that the days of the week are
adequately repre&shy;sented. Used for inter&shy;national compar&shy;isons of relationships
of nutrient intakes to health and susceptibility to chronic disease.
Inexpensive, easy, quick, with low respon&shy;dent burden so that compliance
is high. Large coverage possible; can be used with illiterate indi&shy;viduals.
Element of surprise so less likely to modify eating pattern. Single 24h
recalls likely to omit foods con&shy;sumed infrequently. Relies on memory
and hence unsatisfactory for the elderly and young children. Multiple
replicate 24h&nbsp;recalls can be used to estimate 
the usual intakes of indi&shy;viduals.
</ul>
<span class="topic">Estimated food record.</span>
Record of all food
and bever&shy;ages “as eaten” (including snacks),
over periods from one to seven days. Quantities
estimated in house&shy;hold measures. Nutrient
intakes calculated using food composition data.
<ul><li><span class="topic">Uses and Limitations</span>
Used to assess actual or usual intakes of indi&shy;viduals, depending on
number of measurement days. Data on usual intakes used for diet
counseling and statis&shy;tical analysis involving corre&shy;la&shy;tion  and regression.
Accuracy depends on the conscientiousness of subject and ability to
estimate quantities. Reactivity may be an issue. 
Longer time frames result in a&nbsp;higher respon&shy;dent
burden and lower cooperation. Subjects must be literate 
unless a trained researcher conducts the estimated food record in the home.
</ul>
<span class="topic">Weighed food record.</span>
All food con&shy;sumed over
a defined period is weighed by the subject, caretaker,
or assistant. Food samples may be saved
indi&shy;vidually, or as a&nbsp;composite, for nutrient
analysis. Alter&shy;natively, nutrient intakes calculated
using food composition data.
<ul><li><span class="topic">Uses and Limitations</span>
Used to assess actual or usual intakes of indi&shy;viduals, depending on the
number of measurement days. Accurate but time consuming. Setting
must permit weighing. Subjects may change their usual eating pattern to
simplify weighing or to impress inves&shy;tigator &mdash; 
termed &mdash; reactivity. Requires motivated,
and willing partic&shy;ipants. Expensive. For illiterate participants, 
weighed food records can be conducted by a trained research assistant in the home.
</ul>
<span class="topic">Dietary history. </span>
Interview method consisting
of a&nbsp;24h&nbsp;recall of actual intake, plus inform&shy;ation
on overall usual eating pattern, followed
by a&nbsp;food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire to verify and
clarify initial data. Usual portion sizes recorded
in house&shy;hold measures. Nutrient intakes calculated
using food composition data.
<ul><li><span class="topic">Uses and Limitations.</span>
Used to describe usual food or nutrient intakes over a&nbsp;relatively long
time period, which can be used to estimate prevalence of inadequate
intakes. Such inform&shy;ation is used for national food policy development,
for food fortification planning, and to identify food patterns associated
with inadequate intakes. Labor-intensive, time-consuming, and results
depend on skill of inter&shy;viewer.  The absence of a&nbsp;stan&shy;dardized format
limits compar&shy;ison of its usefulness across studies.
</ul>
<span class="topic">Food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire. </span>
Uses comprehensive
or specific food item list to record
intakes over a&nbsp;given period (day, week, month,
year). Record is obtained by inter&shy;view or
self-admin&shy;istered question&shy;naire. Questionnaire
can be semi-quanti&shy;tative when subjects asked to
quantify usual portion sizes of food items, with
or without the use of food models.
<ul><li><span class="topic">Uses and Limitations</span>
Designed to obtain qualitative, descriptive data on usual intakes of
foods, classes of foods, or nutrients (if semi-quanti&shy;tative) 
over a&nbsp;long time period. Useful in epidemio&shy;logical
studies for ranking subjects into broad categories of low, medium,
and high intakes of specific foods, food components, or nutrients, for
compar&shy;ison with the prevalence or mortality statistics of a&nbsp;specific disease.
Can also identify food patterns associated with inadequate intakes
of specific nutrients. Method is rapid, with low respon&shy;dent burden and
high response rate, but accuracy is lower than for other methods.

<h2>3.2 Technical improvements in food con&shy;sump&shy;tion mea&shy;sure&shy;ments</h2>

The increasing evidence of the relationship between diet and
chronic disease has led to a&nbsp;number of technical advances in
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments of food con&shy;sump&shy;tion for indi&shy;viduals. They
include the use of the telephones in surveys, digital photo&shy;graphs
of food portions displayed on a&nbsp;computer/tablet or captured
with a&nbsp;cell-phone camera, as well as
web-based tools, mobile apps, and image-based
assess&shy;ment. These innovative technologies aim to improve
the speed, accuracy, and partic&shy;ipation, and reduce reporting
burden, bias, and the cost of collecting and analyzing
dietary intake data during large scale epidemio&shy;logical
studies as well as national surveys. A summary of the
strengths and limitations of these innovative technologies
designed to improve dietary assess&shy;ment methods is shown in

A robust assess&shy;ment of the perform&shy;ance, cost, and response rates

<h3>3.2.1 Telephone</h3>

A telephone survey that is well-designed and
carefully-admin&shy;istered appears to be a&nbsp;promising method of
obtaining dietary inform&shy;ation. In partic&shy;ular, telephoned
24h&nbsp;recalls are being increasingly used. The USDA has
conducted several studies to examine the feasibility of
using telephone follow-up surveys instead of mail follow-up
for 24h&nbsp;recalls. Results have been promising: response
rates for telephone follow-up were much greater than those
for mail follow-up.  Casey et&nbsp;al. 
<span data-tippy-content="Casey, P. H., Goolsby, S. L., Lensing, S. Y., Perloff, B. P., & Bogle, M. L. (1999). The use of telephone inter&shy;view methodology to obtain 24-hour dietary recalls.

carried out a
validation study in which the results of 24h&nbsp;recalls
conducted over the telephone were compared with in-person
recalls collected in the 1994-1996 USDA Continuing Survey of 
Food Intakes by Individuals; strong
corre&shy;la&shy;tions were reported. As a&nbsp;result, since 2002 NHANES
have used the telephone to admin&shy;ister the second recall day
<span class="n">3&ndash;10d</span>  later using the AMPR method

<p>
Several other large-scale telephone dietary surveys have
been used in the United States, some of which have used a
food fre&shy;quency instrument rather than a&nbsp;24h&nbsp;recall.  Lyu et&nbsp;al. 
<span data-tippy-content="Lyu, L. C., Hankin, J. H., Liu, L. Q., Wilkens, L. R., Lee, J. H., Goodman, M. T., & Kolonel, L. N. (1998).

successfully showed that agreement between
telephone and face-to-face inter&shy;views  
of a&nbsp;semi-quanti&shy;tative
food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire in Hawaii 
made up of 115 food items was
good and unaffected by age, gender, ethnicity, or education
of the respon&shy;dents. These inves&shy;tigators did
recommend mailing photo&shy;graphs of foods in three portion
sizes in advance, to help respon&shy;dents estimate amounts eaten
more accurately.
<p>
Many of the smaller telephone dietary studies have been
conducted on adult women

In college students, food intakes by telephoned recalls have been
compared against actual intakes determined surrep&shy;titiously

More studies are needed, however, among certain life-stage
groups, to establish the validity of 24h&nbsp;recalls or food
fre&shy;quency question&shy;naires admin&shy;istered over the telephone.
Under-reporting of self-reported food intakes may still occur
in telephone recalls, as they do with in-person recalls;
this was observed, for example, when total energy intakes
derived from telephone-admin&shy;istered 24h&nbsp;recalls were
compared with total energy expenditure measured by doubly
labeled water
<span data-tippy-content="Tran, K. M., Johnson, R. K., Soultanakis, R. P., & Matthews, D. E. (2000).

">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10916515" target="right" >Tran et&nbsp;al., 2000</a>) </span> 
(see Chapter&nbsp;7).
<p>
Telephone surveys do have several advantages. These include
their ability to reach a&nbsp;large number of persons at perhaps
less than half the cost of face-to-face surveys. As well,
with the advent of computer-assisted telephone inter&shy;viewing,
the inter&shy;views can be readily stan&shy;dardized, queries can be
clarified, and responses can be coded immediately, during an
inter&shy;viewing time that is much shorter than a&nbsp;face-to-face
inter&shy;view. As a&nbsp;result, the response rate is enhanced.
<p>
Potential inter&shy;viewer biases can be eliminated by using
computer-assisted telephone inter&shy;viewing, an approach used
with the AMPR in the NHANES surveys. However, other sources
of bias may occur with telephone surveys; these may arise
from non&shy;coverage and non&shy;response. In the United States,
although over 87% of the popu&shy;lation owns a&nbsp;telephone,
subgroups such as the poor, certain minorities, and the`
elderly still have fewer telephones than the general
popu&shy;lation. Such dif&shy;fer&shy;ential coverage can introduce bias
in national surveys unless alternative compensating
strategies are employed. Strategies may include using
supplementary face-to-face or mail inter&shy;views for persons
without telephones; statis&shy;tical adjustments employing
weighting for sex, age, race, and income; selective
over-sampling of the non-telephone users; and random-digit
dialing to contact those with unlisted numbers. Nonresponse
is also a&nbsp;source of potential bias that influences telephone
surveys. This is espe&shy;cially a&nbsp;prob&shy;lem among certain
subgroups such as the ethnic minorities for whom language
barriers may be consid&shy;erable, the elderly who may have
hearing difficulties, and persons with less education.
<p>
Despite these limitations, telephone dietary surveys are a
practical, economical, and valid alternative to the
conventional face-to-face methods for large-scale
epidemio&shy;logical studies and nutrition surveys and for
developing and evaluating community-based nutrition
inter&shy;ventions in higher income coun&shy;tries.

<h3>3.2.2 Portion size estimation aids</h3>

Errors in quantifying the portions of food con&shy;sumed are often
the largest error in most food con&shy;sump&shy;tion surveys,
unless weighed food records are used. As a&nbsp;result, several
types of portion-size measurement aids (PSMAs) have been
devel&shy;oped in an effort to enhance the accuracy of portion
size esti&shy;mates (see Chapter 5 for more details). PSMAs
can be divided into two categories: (1) non-photo&shy;graphic
aids and (2) photo&shy;graphic aids. Canada was one of the first
coun&shy;tries to use non-photo&shy;graphic aids in its National Nutrition Survey
in 1973.  The aids consisted of a&nbsp;collection of three-dimensional graduated
food models of various volumes and surface areas prepared
from paper-mache, wood, or hardboard. A range of
graduated food models was used to prevent the tendency to
generate a&nbsp;&ldquo;direct&rdquo; response. The latter phenomenon is observed
when plastic food models representing only &ldquo;average&rdquo; portion
sizes are used
<span data-tippy-content="Samuelson G. An epidemio&shy;logical study of child health and nutrition in a&nbsp;northern Swedish County. II. Methodological study of the recall tech&shy;nique. Nutr Metab. 1970;12(6):321&ndash;340.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5519001" target="right" >Samuelson, 1970</a>). </span> 

The  Canadian surface-area models
were accom&shy;panied by stan&shy;dard thickness indi&shy;cators made of
hardboard squares. These were used during the 
24h&nbsp;recalls to assist in assessing the overall size and
thickness of foods such as cheese, cold meats, cakes and
cookies. Use of thickness indi&shy;cators is critical for
assessing portion sizes of intact cuts of meat, espe&shy;cially
when irregular in shape.
<p></p>
Since 1973, graduated food models 
(<a href="#figure3.2">Figure&nbsp;3.2</a>)

have been used with 24h&nbsp;recalls in many national food
con&shy;sump&shy;tion surveys, including those in the United States
<span data-tippy-content="National Health and Nutrition Examin&shy;ation Survey (NHANES). (2017). In person dietary inter&shy;viewer’s procedures manual.">(<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=NHANES+procedures+manual.+" target="right" >NHANES, 2017</a>)</span> 
and New Zealand
<span data-tippy-content="Ministry of Health. National nutrition surveys. New Zealand.">(<a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/nz-health-statistics/national-collections-and-surveys/surveys/past-surveys/nutrition-survey" target="right" >MOH, 1997</a>). </span> 

In the dietary
component of the NHANES nationwide surveys, the tool
devel&shy;oped to measure portion sizes in the 24h&nbsp;recalls
consists of a&nbsp;food model booklet of 32 life-size
two-dimensional drawings of house&shy;hold vessels (glasses,
mugs, bowls), abstract shapes (mounds and spreads), and
geometrical models (circles, a&nbsp;grid, wedges, and thickness
bars), together with a&nbsp;set of measuring cups, spoons, and
rulers

(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/measuring_guides_dri/2002/fmb.htm" >USDA 
2002+</a>)</span>; 

More details are given in Chapter 5. In low-income coun&shy;tries, PSMAs for 24h&nbsp;recalls
may be salted replicas of staple foods, real foods, and local house&shy;hold
utensils (e.g., bowls, plates, spoons). These are often used in
combination with items to simulate liquid and solid foods (e.g.,
water or raw rice), manip&shy;ulative models (modelling clay or
play dough), tape measures or rulers and graduated food
models

<p></p>
More recently, photo&shy;graphs are being increasingly used as
PSMAs. They may include pictures of indi&shy;vidual foods or
meals which have been drawn, printed, or displayed digitally, often in
color and sometimes shown next to a&nbsp;stan&shy;dard sized
object (e.g., a&nbsp;coin) or grid&shy;lines to aid the respon&shy;dent's
perception of scale. For surveys using 24h&nbsp;recalls, a
series of graduated portion-size photo&shy;graphs (i.e., amount
con&shy;sumed on any one occasion) for each food item are
commonly displayed during the inter&shy;view, whereas for surveys
employing food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naires, either an average
serving size for each food (i.e., average amount served in
one helping) or a&nbsp;series of serving sizes (small, average,
large) are often used. The graduated portion-size
photo&shy;graphs are often bound together in a&nbsp;photo&shy;graphic
atlas. 
<p>
Practical guidelines on how to develop a&nbsp;photo&shy;graphic atlas
are given by Nelson and Haraldsdottir

and

Vossenaar et al.  

<span data-tippy-content="Vossenaar M, Crispim SP, Lubowa A, Deitchler M, Moursi M, Arimond M. 2020. Guidance for the Development of Food Photographs for Portion Size Estimation in Quantitative 24-Hour Dietary Recall Surveys in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. Washington, DC and Curitiba, Brazil">
(<a href="https://www.intake.org/resource/guidance-development-food-photographs-portion-size-estimation-quantitative-24-hour-dietary"
target="right" >2020</a>). </span> 

Factors that must be consid&shy;ered in relation to the format of the
photo&shy;graphs include size of the image, number and range of
portions sizes depicted, and the inter&shy;val between portion
sizes. In the EPIC study, for example, there was a&nbsp;25%
difference between portion sizes to allow a&nbsp;real visual
perception of differences in size
<span data-tippy-content="Vilela, S., Lopes, C., Guiomar, S., Severo, M., Rangelova, L., Petrova, S., Horváth, Z., Cseh, J., Schweter, A., Lindtner, O., Ambrus, Á., & Torres, D. (2018).

used portion weights from the British
Adult Dietary Survey ranging from the 5th to the 95th
percentile for a&nbsp;series of eight photo&shy;graphs for each food.
Other important factors that should be stan&shy;dardized include
the order of presentation of the photo&shy;graphs, labels used,
angle at which the photo&shy;graph was taken, background and use
of reference objects for scale, color versus black and
white, and use of one versus several foods on a&nbsp;plate.
<p>
Increasingly digital photos of food portions with multiple
images displayed on a&nbsp;computer or a&nbsp;tablet are replacing
printed photos to reduce the cost of printing atlases and
their transportation to dif&shy;fer&shy;ent inter&shy;view sites.  Nichelle et&nbsp;al. 
<span data-tippy-content="Nichelle, P. G., Almeida, C., Camey, S. A., Garmus, L. M., Elias, V., Marchioni, D. M., da Silva, D. G., Ocke, M. C., Slimani, N., Fisberg, R. M., & Crispim, S. P. (2019).

compared the accuracy of three portion sizes
(small, medium, large) from printed photo&shy;graphs in the
Brazilian GloboDiet atlas with digital photos displayed on a
computer screen for 20 foods selected from the Brazilian
GloboDiet atlas. The mean error (difference between the
estimated and true portions) was not significantly dif&shy;fer&shy;ent
between the printed and digital photos, with agreement on
using the printed and digital photos being 91% and 90%,
respe&shy;ctively.
<p>
During the development of the Internet-based, Automated,
Self-Admin&shy;istered 24h&nbsp;recall (ASA24), Subar et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Subar, A. F., Kirkpatrick, S. I., Mittl, B., Zimmerman, T. P., Thompson, F. E., Bingley, C., Willis, G., Islam, N. G., Baranowski, T., McNutt, S., & Potischman, N. (2012). The Automated Self-Administered 24-hour dietary recall (ASA24): a&nbsp;resource for researchers, clinicians, and educators from the National Cancer Institute.

investigated the best way to provide digital images as
portion-size estimation aides. They compared the photo&shy;graphs
said to represent portion sizes of foods con&shy;sumed by the
respon&shy;dents on the previous day with the actual weights
obtained by surrep&shy;titious weighing. The images were also
varied by the angle in which the photo&shy;graphs were taken, the
type of image, and the number and size of digital images
presented in an effort to determine how best to present the
digital images to facilitate accuracy. None of the
photo&shy;graphs were labeled with portion-size inform&shy;ation.
Results indi&shy;cated that accuracy was not affected by the type
of image, whether the images were presented simul&shy;taneously
vs. sequen&shy;tially, or the size and number of images
presented, although there was a&nbsp;tendency for eight rather
than four images to be more accurate. Based on these
results, aerial photo&shy;graphs are used for portion size
estimation in the ASA24.
<p>
Alter&shy;natively, real-time images of foods and bever&shy;ages
con&shy;sumed by the respon&shy;dent, and captured passively, or
actively with a&nbsp;cell-phone camera
<span data-tippy-content="Arab L, Estrin D, Kim DH, Burke J, Goldman J. Feasibility testing of an automated image-capture method to aid dietary recall.

can be used as PSMAs during a&nbsp;24h
recall the following day. The active methods require the
respon&shy;dents to take pictures in the appropriate way (e.g.,
45&deg;angle, arms distance from the plate, with a&nbsp;size
reference included for scale) before and after eating all
meals, and to add accompanying notes. However, all of these tasks
necessitate training the respon&shy;dents. As a&nbsp;result, for
low-literacy popu&shy;lations, the passive tech&shy;niques are more
suitable, where an indi&shy;vidual wears a&nbsp;camera to capture photo&shy;graphs, thus
requiring less involvement by the respon&shy;dent. 
<p>
In many food con&shy;sump&shy;tion surveys in both lower and higher
income coun&shy;tries, a&nbsp;mixture of non-photo&shy;graphic and
photo&shy;graphic aids have been used as PSMAs. A system&shy;atic 
review that included both non-photo&shy;graphic and photo&shy;graphic
PSMAs concluded that culturally appropriate digital or
hard-copy photo&shy;graphic PSMAs were more accurate than
non-photo&shy;graphic food models and house&shy;hold utensils
<span data-tippy-content="Amoutzopoulos, B., Page, P., Roberts, C., Roe, M., Cade, J., Steer, T., Baker, R., Hawes, T., Galloway, C., Yu, D., & Almiron-Roig, E. (2020).

The inves&shy;tigators also
emphasized when selecting an appropriate tool for estimating
portion sizes, both the setting and popu&shy;lation under study
must be consid&shy;ered. Most of the studies included in this
review were from high income coun&shy;tries. In a&nbsp;study in rural
Bolivia, however, the mean energy and nutrient intakes of 45
women 
<span class="n">(20&ndash;52y)</span>  obtained using an
inter&shy;viewer-admin&shy;istered atlas of graduated photos of local
foods combined with digital food photo&shy;graphs taken by the
respon&shy;dents on the day prior to the 24h&nbsp;recall, were
compared with those derived from a&nbsp;weighed record. No
significant mean differences were reported in estimated and
actual food amounts between the 24h&nbsp;recall using the food
photo album and the digital photo&shy;graphs and weighed food
records, except for a&nbsp;few foods (rice, potatoes, eggs,
veg&shyetables). For the latter foods, differences ranged from &minus;5.4% for
veg&shyetables to &minus;6.8% for rice. However, there was a&nbsp;slight
under&shy;estimation in values between the two methods for some
nutrients

The use of automated 24h&nbsp;recall inter&shy;views in web-based
systems stan&shy;dardizes the inter&shy;viewing process so there is
consistency in the format in relation to the questioning and
sequence, food descriptors, and methods used to estimate
food portion sizes. Some (e.g., ASA24; INTAKE24; myfood24)
use a&nbsp;meal-based approach.

<p>
Groupings of foods and recipes, as well as the level of
detail used to describe foods varies across systems. In
most of the applications, ingredients of mixed dishes are
entered separately in either the raw or cooked form, with an
option to select a&nbsp;generic mixed dish if the ingredients of
the recipe are unknown. Some of these on-line systems use
only food portion photo&shy;graphs to help respon&shy;dents report the
amount of each food con&shy;sumed (e.g., ASA24; DietDay), whereas
others (e.g., INTAKE24) use multiple options for portion
size selection. These may include graduated photo&shy;graphs or
images of actual foods, guide photo&shy;graphs for selected
prepackaged items (e.g., snacks), with or without additional
options such as photo&shy;graphs/pictures of house&shy;hold measures
(glasses, cups, bowls, teaspoons etc.) Generally, additional
automated prompts for potentially forgotten items are
programmed and quality controls are implemented at each step
of the inter&shy;view procedure, with checks made on outlier
values. Standardized algorithms are often used to calculate
automatically grams of the food con&shy;sumed, and the amounts of
ingredients (either raw or cooked) con&shy;sumed from a&nbsp;mixed
dish. Some of the applications, espe&shy;cially for children,
record the amounts served and leftovers rather than the
amounts con&shy;sumed. Most applications have a&nbsp;separate screen
for describing and quantifying dietary supplements. Usually,
at the end of the inter&shy;view, a&nbsp;summary is displayed with the
opportunity for the respon&shy;dent to correct or edit
inform&shy;ation at each stage of the inter&shy;view. Each web-based
system is linked to an in-country food composition data&shy;base,
some of which include branded food items (e.g., ASA24, myfood24),
with automated coding for those reported foods and bever&shy;ages
that are in the food composition data&shy;base. Items not in the
data&shy;base are coded manually.
<p>
When developing web-based systems, the potential technology
readiness of the user must be consid&shy;ered. Certain
popu&shy;lation groups, including older indi&shy;viduals with lower

difficulty using a&nbsp;computerized assess&shy;ment tool.   Currently,
only a&nbsp;few of these web-based 24h&nbsp;recall systems have
undergone rigorous evaluation using either independent
biomarkers (i.e., Intake24)

although for most when compared with the stan&shy;dard
24h&nbsp;recall method, agreement is generally close
(Cade, 2017). More well-designed validation studies of web-based
systems employing biomarker measures to investigate
misreporting of dietary intakes, by age, educational level,
BMI, and gender are needed before they can be applied in
epidemio&shy;logical studies involving multi-center sites

<p>
In low-income coun&shy;tries where reliable inter&shy;net access may be
lacking, espe&shy;cially in rural areas, web-based methods
are not feasible for assessing dietary intakes, espe&shy;cially
when self-admin&shy;istered, due to the low literacy rates that
often exist. To address these concerns in low-income
coun&shy;tries, the International Dietary Data Expansion (INDDEX)
Project has devel&shy;oped a&nbsp;dietary assess&shy;ment platform called
INDDEX24
<span data-tippy-content="Coates, J. C., Colaiezzi, B. A., Bell, W., Charrondiere, U. R., & Leclercq, C. (2017).

">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28300759" target="right" >Coates et&nbsp;al., 2017</a>). </span>

The platform consists of a
mobile application for the collection of off-line
indi&shy;vidual-level dietary data using the 24h&nbsp;recall method
with the AMPM, linked to a&nbsp;web data&shy;base application so that
the users can download the required country-specific food
composition data. The dietary recall mobile application uses an
open source mobile data collection platform (Commcare) so
that it is accessible to researchers at no or low cost. The
application is designed so that it is straightforward to use
and contains a&nbsp;number of quality control features such as
controls to prevent entry of implausible values, pre-defined
portion-size estimation methods depending on the type of
food reported, and real time calcu&shy;lation of the respon&shy;dent's
reported energy intake in order to identify possible under-
and over-reported intakes

The mobile app converts food portions reported in
non-stan&shy;dard units into gram-weight equiv&shy;alents by linking

<h3>3.2.4 Image-based methods of dietary assess&shy;ment</h3>

These are defined as any method in which images are used for
identifying foods, or for portion size estimation. Personal
digital assistants (i.e., handheld computers) were used
initially for these image-based methods, but have now been
replaced by camera-enabled cellular phones or smartphones,
digital, disposable, or 35mm cameras, wearable cameras, or
digital video cameras. Many of these image-enabled devices
rely on users manually taking photo&shy;graphs of foods (i.e.,
active image capture). Alter&shy;natively, for those methods
termed &ldquo;passive image capture&rdquo;, pictures are automatically
taken, usually at timed inter&shy;vals (e.g., every 10&nbsp;seconds)
by the devices (predominantly wearable digital cameras), so
that no inter&shy;vention is required on the part of the user.
The majority of tools that use active image capture have
been designed for research purposes to enhance the accuracy
of self-reported intakes. Fewer passive image
capture methods exist and none is fully automated, most
relying on specialists to manually estimate portion size
<span data-tippy-content="Gemming, L., Utter, J., & Ni Mhurchu, C. (2015). Image-assisted dietary assessment: a&nbsp;systematic review of the evidence. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 115(1), 64&ndash;77.">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25441955" target="right" >Gemming et&nbsp;al., 2015a</a>). </span> 
<p>
A few image-based methods are based on a&nbsp;combination of
tools. Examples include: SmartPlate (SRI International, 2015), which
consists of a&nbsp;camera and sensor-enabled dinner plate, the
Diet Data Recorder System (DDSR), a&nbsp;three-part system
comprised of a&nbsp;camera-enabled smartphone, laser module, and
circuit module
<span data-tippy-content="Bell, W., Colaiezzi, B. A., Prata, C. S., & Coates, J. C. (2017). Scaling up Dietary Data for Decision-Making in Low-Income Countries: New Technological Frontiers. Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.), 8(6), 916–932.
">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29141974" target="right" >Bell et&nbsp;al., 2017</a>), </span>

and the Dietary Intake
Monitoring System (DIMS). The latter is a&nbsp;five-part system
with a&nbsp;digital camera, weighing scale, infrared
thermometer, radio-fre&shy;quency identification reader (RFID),
and a&nbsp;user RFID transponder card
<span data-tippy-content="Ofei KT, Dobroczynski MT, Rasmussen HH, Mikkelsen BE. (2014). The Dietary Intake Monitoring System (DIMS) - an Innovative Device for Capturing Patient’s Food Choice, Food Intake and Plate Waste in a&nbsp;Hospital Setting. Paper presented at the Measuring Behavior 2014, Wageningen, The Netherlands. ">(<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265085296_The_Dietary_Intake_Monitoring_System_DIMS_-_an_Innovative_Device_for_Capturing_Patient%27s_Food_Choice_Food_Intake_and_Plate_Waste_in_a_Hospital_Setting" target="right" >Ofei et&nbsp;al., 2014</a>). </span> 
Most of the image-based methods are portable. Exceptions are 
the DIMS which is mounted on a&nbsp;small cart and the
SmartPlate which is dinner-plate size and hence less
convenient to carry compared to the other smaller devices.
<p>
Image-based methods can be further subdivided into three
groups: image-based food records, image-assisted food
records, and image-assisted 24h&nbsp;recalls. Image-based food
records are defined as methods in which images of foods
captured during eating episodes serve as the entire basis
for the dietary assess&shy;ment, whereas in image-assisted food
records, the images captured are used to enhance or
supplement a&nbsp;tradi&shy;tional text-based food record (written or
electronic). In image-assisted 24h&nbsp;recalls, the food
images captured during eating episodes are used to aid
self-reporting during the 24h&nbsp;recall. For more details
of image-based methods, the reader is referred to the
following reviews

<p>
Several studies have confirmed that image-based methods of
dietary assess&shy;ment are preferred over tradi&shy;tional dietary
records, and can enhance self-reported dietary intake by
revealing unreported foods and misreporting errors.
However, study costs will be increased when respon&shy;dents have
to be provided with a&nbsp;suitable device
<span data-tippy-content="Gemming, L., Utter, J., & Ni Mhurchu, C. (2015). Image-assisted dietary assessment: a&nbsp;systematic review of the evidence.

With the additional dietary inform&shy;ation from the
images, there is likely to be an increase in reported energy
intake and a&nbsp;decrease in reporting errors, except when the
methods are followed incorrectly so the images are of poor
quality, or the user forgets to capture images before eating
episodes. In addition, details of mixed dishes are
difficult to extract from the images, some ingredients may
be hidden, and cooking methods omitted. To avoid these
prob&shy;lems, respon&shy;dents should be trained to review the images
after taking them, to take a&nbsp;second image if necessary,
and to record descrip&shy;tions of the mixed dishes, including lists
of ingredients and quantities. Coding errors associated
with image analysis, however, are likely to be less random
and less prob&shy;lematic compared to the system&shy;atic  bias
observed when food type and portion size are self-reported.

with the respon&shy;dent capturing an image with the mobile food
record. In this
method, respon&shy;dents use the camera of a&nbsp;mobile devise to
capture images of their intake of foods and bever&shy;ages which
they send to a&nbsp;secure server, where trained analysts
estimate the reported intakes of energy and nutrients.

<h3>3.2.5 Wearable devices</h3>

Under development are wearable devices worn around the neck,
wrist, ear, or attached to clothing and designed to
objectively measure diet without relying on user-reported
food intake
<span data-tippy-content="Fontana, J. M., Higgins, J. A., Schuckers, S. C., Bellisle, F., Pan, Z., Melanson, E. L., Neuman, M. R., & Sazonov, E. (2015).

Some (e.g., WearSens,
worn around the neck) lack the ability to detect specific
types of foods, and thus quantify nutrient intakes, while
others (e.g., GoBe, worn as a&nbsp;wristband) only measure
calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrate. Several chewing
and bite-related wearable sensors are also being devel&shy;oped
which aim to dif&shy;fer&shy;entiate between food intake and non-food
intake, with some aiming to estimate energy intake (e.g.,
BitBite)
<span data-tippy-content="Fontana, J. M., Higgins, J. A., Schuckers, S. C., Bellisle, F., Pan, Z., Melanson, E. L., Neuman, M. R., & Sazonov, E. (2015).

<h2>3.3 Selecting an appropriate method</h2>

The method of choice for assessing food or nutrient intakes
depends primarily on the objectives of the study. No method
is devoid of random or system&shy;atic  errors (Chapter 5), or
prevents alterations in the food habits of the respon&shy;dents.
However, statis&shy;tical techniques are now available which are designed 
to mitigate the impact of measurement errors on study results. See 
Freedman et al.

Box 3.2 provides guidance on the most appropriate methods
for assessing food or nutrient intakes in relation to four
possible levels of objectives.

<div class="smallbox"><b>Box 3.2: Selection of methodology to measure nutrient intakes to meet four possible levels of objectives. </b>	
<p>
<span class="topic">Level One:</span>
Mean nutrient intake of a&nbsp;group
<ul><li><span class="topic">Preferred approach</span>
A single 24h&nbsp;recall, or single weighed or estimated food

of all days of the week</li></ul>

<span class="topic">Level Two:</span>

<span class="topic">Level Three:</span>

 <ul><li><span class="topic">Preferred approach</span>

<span class="topic">Level Four:</span>

Alter&shy;natively, a&nbsp;semiquanti&shy;tative food fre&shy;quency

</div>
<p>
Note that the number and selection of replicate 24h
recalls, or weighed or estimated one&nbsp;day food records required
to obtain level two, level three, or level four data,
depends on the day-to-day vari&shy;a&shy;tion  within one indi&shy;vidual
(i.e., within-person vari&shy;a&shy;tion ) of the nutrient of inter&shy;est
(Chapter 6). This vari&shy;a&shy;tion  depends on the nutrient, the
study popu&shy;lation, and the seasonal vari&shy;a&shy;tions of intake.
Generally, for nutrients found in high concen&shy;trations in
only a&nbsp;few foods, such as vitamins&nbsp;A and&nbsp;D and cholesterol,
the number of replicates needed is greater than for those
found in a&nbsp;wide range of foods (e.g., protein).
Noncon&shy;secutive days should be selected for the replicates
when possible, to enhance the statis&shy;tical power of the
inform&shy;ation: day-to-day corre&shy;la&shy;tions between intakes often
occur when food intake data are collected over consecutive
days. The length of time needed between the observation
days also depends on the nutrient

<p>
Additional factors that should be consid&shy;ered when choosing a
method for assessing the food con&shy;sump&shy;tion of indi&shy;viduals are




the characteristics of the indi&shy;viduals within the study
popu&shy;lation, the respon&shy;dent burden of the method, and the
available resources. For instance, certain methods are
unsuitable for elderly subjects with poor memories, for busy
mothers with young children, or for illiterate indi&shy;viduals.
Other methods require highly trained personnel and
specialized laboratory and com&shy;put&shy;ing facilities, which may
not be available. Generally, the more accurate methods are
associated with higher costs, greater respon&shy;dent burden, and
lower response rates. Unfor&shy;tu&shy;nately, compromises often have
to be made between the collection of precise data on usual
nutrient intakes of indi&shy;viduals and a&nbsp;high response rate.

<h3>3.3.1 Determining the mean nutrient intake of a&nbsp;group:
level one</h3>

Level one is the easiest objective to achieve and can be met
by measuring the food intake of each subject in the group
using a&nbsp;single 24h&nbsp;recall or a&nbsp;one&nbsp;day food record, provided
the indi&shy;viduals are representative of the study popu&shy;lation
and all the days of the week are proportionately repre&shy;sented
in the final sample. Data on mean usual nutrient intakes of
a group can be used for inter&shy;national compar&shy;isons across
coun&shy;tries of the relationship of nutrient intakes to health
and disease. However, this method based on a&nbsp;single intake day 
per subject should never be used for
reporting the distri&shy;bution  of intakes (i.e., as percentiles of intake)
<span data-tippy-content="Tooze JA. (2020). Estimating usual intakes from dietary surveys: methodologic challenges, analysis, approaches and recommendations for low- and middle-income coun&shy;tries. Washington, DC: Intake Center for Dietary Assessment/FHI Solutions.">(<a href="https://www.intake.org/index.php/resource/estimating-usual-intakes-dietary-surveys-methodologic-challenges-analysis-approaches-and" target="right" >Tooze, 2020</a>). </span> 

To calculate n, the number of subjects required in the group,
an estimate of the between-person vari&shy;a&shy;tion  for the nutrient of inter&shy;est is
needed. This is usually obtained from the literature but
may be determined during a&nbsp;pilot study. 
<p>
As an example, assume the expected mean iron intake obtained
from the literature is 10mg/d, with an anticipated stan&shy;dard
deviation (s) of 3mg/d. Also assume that we want to be 95%
confident that the true mean lies between 9.2 to 10.8mg/d
(i.e., the confi&shy;dence inter&shy;val has limits which are 0.8mg/d on 
either side of the mean).  A 95% confi&shy;dence inter&shy;val is calculated 
approximately as the mean &pm;2 &times; e, where e is the
stan&shy;dard error of the mean  &mdash; a&nbsp;measure of the precision of the estimated mean. Hence , the required e = 0.8/2 = 0.4. 
We can use the following formula to calculate n, the desired group size.
\[\small n = s^{2}_{b} /e^{2 } \]

where <i><span class="nobr">s<span class="supsub">2<br>b</span></span></i>  is the between-person variance of the nutrient of 
inter&shy;est, and <i>e</i> is the desired stan&shy;dard error &mdash; a&nbsp;measure of
precision required for the estimate of the mean intake of
the nutrient of inter&shy;est.
Hence 
\[\small n = 3^{2 } / 0.4^{2 } = 56.25 \]
and so 56 subjects are required.
Alter&shy;natively, if we wanted to be 99% confident that the true mean lies
between 9.2 and 10.8mg/d, then more subjects must be studied.  A
99% confi&shy;dence inter&shy;val is calculated approximately as the 
mean &pm;3 &times; e. Hence the required e = 0.8/3 = 0.27

Therefore <p>
\[\small n = 3^{2 } / 0.27^{2 } = 123 \]
and 123 subjects are required.
<p>
Clearly, the size of the group (n) necessary to characterize the
group mean usual nutrient
intake depends on the degree of precision required:
more indi&shy;viduals must be studied to achieve higher precision.
This calcu&shy;lation of the required group size
should be repeated for each of the nutrients of inter&shy;est,
and the largest n (i.e., the worst case) should be used if
possible.
<p>
If the study objective is to demonstrate a&nbsp;significant
difference in the mean intakes of two groups, or a
significant change in the mean intakes, based on unpaired or
paired data, then alternative formulae must be applied;
details are given in

<h3>3.3.2 Calculating the popu&shy;lation percentage &ldquo;at risk":
level two</h3>

To determine the percentage of the popu&shy;lation &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; of
inadequate nutrient intakes, an estimate of the distri&shy;bution
of usual intakes of the indi&shy;viduals is required. This, in
turn, requires that the food con&shy;sump&shy;tion of indi&shy;viduals be
measured over more than one&nbsp;day. Hence, repeated 24h
recalls, or replicate weighed or estimated one&nbsp;day food records
are the methods of choice, again ensuring that all days
of the week are proportionately repre&shy;sented in the final sample.
Often, it is not feasible to carry out repeated observations
on all the indi&shy;viduals, as in the case of a&nbsp;national dietary
survey, and the recalls or records are repeated on a
sub&shy;sample of the indi&shy;viduals only.
<p>
To achieve a&nbsp;level two objective, at least two independent
mea&shy;sure&shy;ments of food intake should be obtained on at least a
representative random sub&shy;sample of indi&shy;viduals in the
survey. The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board
<span data-tippy-content="IOM (Institute of Medicine).  (2000).  Dietary Reference Intakes: Applications in Dietary Assessment. National Academy Press, Washington, DC.">(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45189/" target="right" >IOM, 2000</a>) </span> 
recommends that the replicate mea&shy;sure&shy;ments should be
independent and made on non-consecutive days 
<span class="n">3&ndash;10d</span>  after
the first recall or record. However, if the data can be collected
only on consecutive days, then three daily mea&shy;sure&shy;ments
should be used. The random sub&shy;sample should consist of at least 
50&nbsp;indi&shy;viduals per demo&shy;graphic group. 
Where possible, the demo&shy;graphic groups to 
be sampled should be defined according to the sex and life-stage groups used
for the chosen Nutrient Reference Values 

<span data-tippy-content="Deitchler M, Arimond M, Carriquiry A, Hotz C, Tooze JA. (2020).

<p>
Note that it is more
important to have a&nbsp;minimum number of replicate observations
in the sub&shy;sample than a&nbsp;minimum proportion of replicate
observations. Once the required number of replicate
observations have been obtained, methods can be applied to
correct for the measurement error associated with both
day-to-day variability in intakes for a&nbsp;single person
(termed within-person vari&shy;a&shy;tion ) and the vari&shy;a&shy;tion  in
intakes between indi&shy;viduals (termed between-person
vari&shy;a&shy;tion ) (see Chapter&nbsp;6).
<p></p>
Four statis&shy;tical methods are now available for estimating
the distri&shy;bution of usual intake. For more details, the
reader is referred to

Of the methods, the
first was outlined by the National Research Council
and later refined by Iowa State University (ISU)

with software devel&shy;oped to use the ISU method. Note, this method
does allow for a&nbsp;random sub-sample of repeated 24h&nbsp;recalls
or food records, and has the capacity to adjust for season,
day of the week, and/or sequence effects, but is not
recommended for general use with episod&shy;ically con&shy;sumed
foods, food groups, or nutrients

devel&shy;oped a&nbsp;method which also adjusts for the same
covariates (season, day of the week, and/or sequence), but
also has the capability of incorporating covariates to
identify esti&shy;mates for sub-popu&shy;lations in the survey. In
addition, the NCI method, unlike the ISU, can be used with
episod&shy;ically con&shy;sumed foods, food groups, or nutrients.

that can also be used for episod&shy;ically con&shy;sumed
foods, food groups, or nutrients, although caution must be
used when employing the program with models containing
covariates. 
The Dutch National Food Con&shy;sump&shy;tion
Survey 2007-2010 have devel&shy;oped a&nbsp;program called the
Statistical Program to Assess Dietary Exposure (SPADE) , but
this program currently requires 24h&nbsp;recalls on at least
two-days for all respon&shy;dents in the sample and is not
recommended for use with episod&shy;ically con&shy;sumed foods, food
groups, or nutrients.
<p>
All the methods described briefly above use varying
approaches to yield an adjusted distri&shy;bution of &ldquo;usual"
nutrient intakes that can then be used to predict the
proportion of the popu&shy;lation at risk of nutrient inadequacy
using either the full probability approach, or the Estimated
Average Requirement (EAR) cutpoint method; details are given
in Chapter&nbsp;8b. However, the choice of which &ldquo;usual intake method&rdquo;
method to use depends on whether foods, food groups, or
nutrients are episod&shy;ically con&shy;sumed, whether the
probability of con&shy;sump&shy;tion and the con&shy;sump&shy;tion-day amount
are correlated or not, and whether replicates of the 24h&nbsp;recalls 
or food records are available on all the popu&shy;lation
groups to be surveyed or only on a&nbsp;sub-sample

Figure&nbsp;3.6 shows that, in the example, adjusting the 
distri&shy;bution significantly using the ISU method reduces the
proportion of indi&shy;viduals consid&shy;ered to have intakes below
the EAR for zinc. 
Within-person vari&shy;a&shy;tion  can also have a&nbsp;significant effect 
on esti&shy;mates of the prevalence of abnormally high nutrient
intakes. 
<a href="#table3.7">Table&nbsp;3.7</a>

The large differences between the observed prevalence and the

removing the within-person vari&shy;a&shy;tion  by calcu&shy;lation. In
this case, very large numbers of repeated mea&shy;sure&shy;ments on

Comparable data are essential for national
food policy development and food fortification planning.
Food patterns associated with inadequate nutrient intakes
can also be identified using this approach, enabling food
assistance programs to be designed and improvements in
nutrition education made.
<p></p>

More recently, a new method has been devel&shy;oped based on single-day dietary data which can be 
used to estimate popu&shy;lation distri&shy;butions of usual intake of nearly-daily con&shy;sumed foods and 
nutrients, provided a suitable external within-person to between-person variance is 
available

Nevertheless, researchers are urged to collect replicate data where possible.    

<h3>3.3.3 Ranking indi&shy;viduals by food or nutrient intake: level
three</h3>

When the study objective is at level three and involves
ranking indi&shy;viduals within a&nbsp;group, often for the purpose of
linking dietary intakes with risk of chronic disease, the
preferred approach is to obtain multiple observations on
each indi&shy;vidual. The number of days required to achieve the
level three objective can be calculated from the ratio of
the within- to the between-person vari&shy;a&shy;tion  in nutrient
intakes (often termed the &ldquo;variance ratio"); for more details
see Chapter 6 . Sometimes an estimate of the variance ratio
can be obtained from the literature, again preferably
from an earlier study on a&nbsp;comparable group. Alter&shy;natively,
a pilot study may be necessary to obtain this inform&shy;ation.
<p>
Several authors have devel&shy;oped equations for calculating the
number of replicate days required to meet level three
objectives

suggest using the
following formula for the number of days
(n) of diet records needed:
<p>

\[\small n = (r^{2} /(1 − r^{2})) × (s^{2}_{w}/s^{2}_{b})\]

<p>
In this equation, <i>r</i> is the unobservable corre&shy;la&shy;tion  between
the observed and true mean intakes of indi&shy;viduals over the
period of observation, and <i><span class="nobr">s<span class="supsub">2<br>w</span></span></i>  and <i><span class="nobr">s<span class="supsub">2<br>b</span></span></i>  are the observed

equation should be used in association with Table&nbsp;3.8 which
shows the proportion of indi&shy;viduals correctly and
incorrectly classified in the extreme fractions for
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent values of the corrlation coefficient between the

when the indi&shy;viduals are divided into terciles, fewer than

\[ \small n = 0.75^{2}/(1&ndash;0.75^{2}) &times; 1.7\]
\[ \small n = \mbox{3 days}\]

<p>
The number of days needed to generate a&nbsp;given r&nbsp;increases as
the chosen r&nbsp;increases. If the size of the within-person
vari&shy;a&shy;tion  (<i><span class="nobr">s<span class="supsub">2<br>w</span></span></i> ) in nutrient intake is small compared with
the size of the between-person (<i><span class="nobr">s<span class="supsub">2<br>b</span></span></i>) vari&shy;a&shy;tion , then fewer
replicate days are needed to meet level three objectives.
<p>
The U.S. subcommittee on criteria for dietary evaluation
<span data-tippy-content="NRC (National Research Council). (1986). Nutrient Adequacy: Assessment using Food Con&shy;sump&shy;tion Surveys. National Academy Press, Washington, DC.">(<a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/618/nutrient-adequacy-assessment-using-food-consumption-surveys" target="right" >NRC, 1986</a>) </span>

recommended using independent days for
replicating the mea&shy;sure&shy;ments of one&nbsp;day nutrient intakes to
reduce any effect of autocorre&shy;la&shy;tion  between intakes on
adjacent days.
<p>
An alternative approach to achieving level three objectives
is to use a&nbsp;semi-quanti&shy;tative food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire.
This approach is often used in epidemio&shy;logical
investigations to study associations between intakes and
risk of disease and does not require a&nbsp;measurement of
absolute nutrient intakes. Although this approach is much
simpler, involving only a&nbsp;single inter&shy;view with each
subject, it is difficult to quantify the errors involved and
to separate the effects of within- and between-person
variance.

<h3>3.3.3 Determining usual intakes of nutrients of indi&shy;viduals:
level four</h3>

Reliable esti&shy;mates of usual food or nutrient intakes of
indi&shy;viduals that can be used with confi&shy;dence to meet a&nbsp;level
four objective, involving corre&shy;la&shy;tion  or regression analysis
with indi&shy;vidual biochemical measures, are the most difficult
to obtain. Large numbers of measurement days for each
indi&shy;vidual are required using 24h&nbsp;recalls or estimated or
weighed food records.
<p>
An estimate of the within-person vari&shy;a&shy;tion  for each nutrient
of inter&shy;est should be obtained from the literature,
preferably from an earlier study on a&nbsp;comparable group or a
pilot study, as noted earlier. This estimate may be
expressed as the variance, <i><span class="nobr">s<span class="supsub">2<br>w</span></span></i> ; stan&shy;dard deviation, s<sub>w</sub>; or
as the coefficient of vari&shy;a&shy;tion  (CV<sub>w</sub>) expressed as a
percentage: 
\[\small CV_{w}= s_{w}/ (\mbox{mean intake}) &times; \mbox{100%}\]
<p>
This estimate can be used in the following equation to
determine the number of days required per indi&shy;vidual to
estimate an indi&shy;vidual's nutrient intake to within 20% of
their true mean 95% of the time
<span data-tippy-content="Beaton, G. H., Milner, J., Corey, P., McGuire, V., Cousins, M., Stewart, E., de Ramos, M., Hewitt, D., Grambsch, P. V., Kassim, N., & Little, J. A. (1979). Sources of variance in 24-hour dietary recall data: implications for nutrition study design and inter&shy;pretation. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 32(12), 2546&ndash;2559. ">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/506977" target="right" >Beaton et&nbsp;al., 1979</a>). </span> 

<p>
\[\small n = (Z_{&alpha;}CV_{w} / D_{0})^{2}\]
<p>
where <I>n</i> = the number of days needed per indi&shy;vidual, <i>Z<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> =
the normal deviate for the percentage of times the measured
value should be within a&nbsp;specified limit (i.e., 1.96 in the
example below), <i>CV<sub>w</sub></i> =  the within-person coefficient of
vari&shy;a&shy;tion  (as a&nbsp;percentage), and <i>D<sub>0</sub></i> = the specified limit
(as a&nbsp;percentage of long-term true usual intake) (i.e., 20% in the
example given below).
<p>
The following example calculates the
number of days required to estimate a&nbsp;Malawian woman's zinc
intake using 24h&nbsp;recalls to within 20% of the true mean,
95% of the time. In this example, the <i>CV<sub>w</sub></i> (i.e., 34%) for
zinc intakes on Malawian women via 24h&nbsp;recalls is taken
from the literature
<span data-tippy-content="International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group (IZiNCG), Brown, K. H., Rivera, J. A., Bhutta, Z., Gibson, R. S., King, J. C., Lönnerdal, B., Ruel, M. T., Sandtröm, B., Wasantwisut, E., & Hotz, C. (2004). International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group (IZiNCG) technical document #1. Assessment of the risk of zinc deficiency in popu&shy;lations and options for its control. Food and nutrition bulletin, 25(1 Suppl 2), S99&ndash;S203. ">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046856" target="right" >IZiNCG, 2004</a>). </span> 

Thus if <i>Z<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> = 1.96
and <i>CV<sub>w</sub></i> = 34%. then: 

<p>
\[\small n = (1.96 &times; 34\% / 20\%)^{2} = 11 d \]
<p>
If a&nbsp;pilot study is undertaken in which replicate 24h
recalls are conducted, then the actual CV<sub>w</sub> for each nutrient
of inter&shy;est can be calculated. In this way, the estimate of
the number of days required to measure the usual intake of
each of the nutrients of inter&shy;est in an indi&shy;vidual, with a
required degree of precision, can be defined. In general,
consid&shy;erably more days are required to obtain reliable
esti&shy;mates of intakes of indi&shy;viduals to meet the level four
objective, compared with level three (i.e., relative ranking
of subjects into groups)
<span data-tippy-content="Palaniappan, U., Cue, R. I., Payette, H., & Gray-Donald, K. (2003). Implications of day-to-day variability on mea&shy;sure&shy;ments of usual food and nutrient intakes.

<p></p>
Sometimes, dietary histories or semi-quanti&shy;tative food
fre&shy;quency question&shy;naires are used to obtain this level four
data on usual nutrient intakes for corre&shy;la&shy;tion  with
biomarkers
<span data-tippy-content="Jacques, P. F., Sulsky, S. I., Sadowski, J. A., Phillips, J. C., Rush, D., & Willett, W. C. (1993).

Some inves&shy;tigators
emphasize, however, that the accuracy of a&nbsp;semi-quanti&shy;tative
food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire is only equivalent to two to
three repeat 24h&nbsp;recalls
<span data-tippy-content="Sempos, C. T., Liu, K., & Ernst, N. D. (1999). Food and nutrient exposures: what to consider when evaluating epidemiologic evidence.

<p>
In some experimentally controlled studies such as balance
studies, inform&shy;ation on the actual nutrient intakes of an
indi&shy;vidual over a&nbsp;finite time period are required. For such
data, weighed food records (Section3.&nbsp;1.4), completed for
the duration of the study period, are the recommended
method. Nutrient intakes can then be calculated using food
composition data. Alter&shy;natively, duplicate meals can be
collected throughout the period for later analysis; details
are given in Chapter&nbsp;4.

<h3>3.3.4 Combining dietary instruments</h3>

Recognition of the limitation of even two 24h&nbsp;recalls to
adequately measure, at the indi&shy;vidual level, usual intake of
foods or nutrients that are not con&shy;sumed daily (i.e.,
episod&shy;ically con&shy;sumed foods) has led to the use of more than
one dietary instrument in a&nbsp;given study. In this way, the
advantages of each method can be exploited and their
weaknesses minimized. Consequently, in large scale
epidemio&shy;logical studies, a&nbsp;common approach is the
admin&shy;istration of a&nbsp;food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire to all
respon&shy;dents, and 24h&nbsp;recalls or food records in a
sub&shy;sample. The food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire provides
inform&shy;ation on foods that are con&shy;sumed less frequently
(often, &ldquo;in the past year") not given by the 24h&nbsp;recalls
while the 24h&nbsp;recalls yield richer detail by attempting to
correctly quantify portion size for each eating occasion
<span data-tippy-content="Subar, A. F., Dodd, K. W., Guenther, P. M., Kipnis, V., Midthune, D., McDowell, M., Tooze, J. A., Freedman, L. S., & Krebs-Smith, S. M. (2006). The food propensity question&shy;naire: concept, development, and validation for use as a&nbsp;covariate in a&nbsp;model to estimate usual food intake.

Alter&shy;natively, a&nbsp;food fre&shy;quency
question&shy;naire could be used as a&nbsp;supplement to one or more
quanti&shy;tative 24h&nbsp;recalls admin&shy;istered to the full sample,
providing richer detail and less system&shy;atic  bias. This
approach appears to have the most added value when the
research question of inter&shy;est is to estimate diet-health
relationships, espe&shy;cially when the estimation of usual dietary intake
at the indi&shy;vidual level  involves a&nbsp;food, food group, or nutrient
that is con&shy;sumed episod&shy;ically
<span data-tippy-content="Tooze JA. (2020). Estimating usual intakes from dietary surveys: methodologic challenges, analysis, approaches and recommendations for low- and middle-income coun&shy;tries.

<p>
Statistical methods have been devel&shy;oped to combine the
dietary data from repeated 24h&nbsp;recalls and food fre&shy;quency
question&shy;naires. Conceptually, these statis&shy;tical methods
presume that the usual food intake of an indi&shy;vidual equals
the probability of consuming a&nbsp;food on a&nbsp;given day (queried
as fre&shy;quency of usual intake over a&nbsp;specified time period),
multiplied by the average amount of intake of that food on a
typical con&shy;sump&shy;tion day. Repeated 24h&nbsp;recalls from the
same indi&shy;vidual yield inform&shy;ation on con&shy;sump&shy;tion probability
and amount, while the food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire provides
inform&shy;ation on intake fre&shy;quency of rarely con&shy;sumed foods
and usual intakes of nutrients when portion size information is available

to enhance the estimation of usual intakes from the 24h&nbsp;recall
data, espe&shy;cially from foods that are not con&shy;sumed every day.
Note, however, that in low income coun&shy;tries where
context-specific food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naires are often not
available or inappropriate in the study setting, it may be
preferable to increase the number of repeat 24h&nbsp;recalls per
respon&shy;dent rather than embarking on the development,
validation, and collection of dietary data using a&nbsp;food
fre&shy;quency question&shy;naire in addition to using the 24h
recall method. For more details, the reader is advised to

<h3>3.3.5 Surveys of indi&shy;vidual food consumption at the global level </h3>

FAO/WHO Global Individual Food consumption data Tool

<span data-tippy-content="FAO/WHO Global Individual Food consumption data Tool">(<a href="https://www.fao.org/gift-individual-food-consumption/en" target="right" >FAO/WHO GIFT</a>)</span> 

is a global data&shy;base of 
surveys of food consumption at the 
indi&shy;vidual-level which are collected at the national and 
sub&shy;national level throughout the world. 
Only data collected from 1980 by quanti&shy;tative methods 
such as 24h recalls, food records (weighed or estimated), 
12hr recalls, and direct food 
weighing are considered. Portion sizes of all 
foods and beverages con&shy;sumed by each survey 
participant must be assessed, including water if possible.  
For low&#8209; or middle-income 
coun&shy;tries, surveys comprising at least 
100&nbsp;subjects (with no evidence of strong selection 
bias) are included, whereas for high-income 
coun&shy;tries, surveys that are nationally 
repre&shy;sen&shy;tative are an additional criterion. 
The dietary data generated from FAO/WHO GIFT can 
be used to inform agricul&shy;tural, nutrition, 
food safety and environmental policies and 
programs. A summary of 218&nbsp;dietary surveys 
performed in low&#8209;and middle-income coun&shy;tries from 
1980 to&nbsp;2019 and included in the FAO/WHO GIFT 
inventory is available in de&nbsp;Quadros et al.  

<span data-tippy-content="de Quadros VP, Balcerzak A, Allemand P, de Sousa RF, Bevere T, Arsenault J, Deitchler M, Holmes BA. Global Trends in the Availability of Dietary Data in Low and Middle-Income Countries. Nutrients. 2022 Jul 21;14(14):2987.">(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35889943" target="right" >2022</a>).</span> 

<p></p>
FAO/WHO GIFT apply several criteria to validate 
the dietary data&shy;bases included. For example, 
for all foods and drinks con&shy;sumed by each survey 
participant on each survey day, a complete 
descrip&shy;tion, the amount con&shy;sumed, and energy 
and nutrient values for each item must be 
included in the datasets. Additional compulsory 
variables are the age and sex of each 
subject, geo&shy;graph&shy;ical location (country, and region(s) 
if available), type of area (e.g., 
rural, urban), and the number of survey days 
recorded per subject or for a subset of 
subjects. Inclusion of variables based on 
anthropometric data such as weight and height and 
the physiological status of both women 
(e.g., pregnant, lactation) and infants (i.e., 
breast&shy;feeding status) are also recommended.
<p></p>
Recipes should be disaggregated whenever possible 
to provide data on the quantity of each 
separate ingredient, cooking method used, 
total amount prepared, number of people served from 
the recipe, and the quantity con&shy;sumed by 
the survey participant (or served and leftover). 
Only with this information can each ingredient be 
attributed to their appropriate food group 
for the calculation of the FAO/WHO GIFT 
indicators and summary statistics. 
<p></p>
The food composition values used are 
provided by the data providers. However, all indi&shy;vidual 
quanti&shy;tative dietary datasets shared through 
FAO/WHO GIFT are coded with the

<span data-tippy-content="FoodEx2 System"><a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/data/data-standardisation" target="right" >FoodEx2</a></span> 

system, a comprehensive and flexible food classification 
and descrip&shy;tion system.  Eligible dietary 
data&shy;bases are mapped manually by the inves&shy;tigator 
with FoodEx2 codes for food groups (n=24) 
and food subgroups based on the descrip&shy;tions 
provided by FAO/WHO GIFT. FoodEx2 was first 
devel&shy;oped by the European Food Safety Authority 
(EFSA) and was later scaled up to the global 
level in collaboration with FAO and the 
World Health Organi&shy;zation (WHO). The use of this 
common food classification and descrip&shy;tion 
system among dietary surveys from dif&shy;fer&shy;ent 
coun&shy;tries contributes to the global harmoni&shy;zation 
of dietary data. Prior to the analysis and 
format&shy;ting by FAO/WHO GIFT, all eligible 
datasets are screened for potential errors, missing 
values and outliers.  For further details see FAO/WHO GIFT  

<span data-tippy-content="FAO/WHO GIFT Methods">(<a href="https://www.fao.org/gift-individual-food-consumption/methodology/en" target="right" >Methods</a>)</span> 

<p></p>
Provided the eligible dietary datasets have been coded 
using FoodEx2, the FAO/WHO GIFT
platform can compute ready-to-use indicators and 
summary statistics based on indi&shy;vidual food 
consumption data in the areas of food consumption, 
food safety and nutrition. For example, of 
the indicators, one reflecting dietary diversity at 
the popu&shy;lation level (a key component of 
diet quality) entitled the Minimum Dietary Diversity 
for Women

<span data-tippy-content="Minimum Dietary Diversity 
for Women">(<a href="https://www.fao.org/nutrition/assessment/tools/minimum-dietary-diversity-women/en/" target="right" >MDD-W</a>)</span> 

is computed. This is a 
food group-based indicator that estimates the 
proportion of non-pregnant women of 
repro&shy;ductive age (15&#8209;49y) who con&shy;sumed at least five 
out of&nbsp;ten defined food groups over 
the previous 24h. 
<p></p>
The summary statistics generated by 
FAO/WHO GIFT comprise the estimated usual intakes of 
selected nutrients for pre-defined popu&shy;lation groups 
by sex and age (except children less 
than aged 12&nbsp;months) provided the datasets contain 
multiple non-consecutive days of 24h 
recalls / food records for at least a subset 
of 50&nbsp;indi&shy;viduals. The statis&shy;tical program chosen 
to adjust the dietary data for day-to-day vari&shy;a&shy;tion  
is the Statistical Program to Assess 
Dietary Exposure (SPADE) by Dekkers et al.

food fre&shy;quency question&shy;naires or short 
standardized question&shy;naires (e.g., Demo&shy;graphic Health
