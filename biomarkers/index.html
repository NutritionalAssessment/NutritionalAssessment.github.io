<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Nutritional bio&shy;markers are defined as biological characteristics that can
be objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal
biological or patho&shy;genic processes, or as responses to nutrition
inter&shy;ventions.  They can be classified as: (i)&nbsp;bio&shy;markers of
exposure; (ii)&nbsp;bio&shy;markers of status;
and (iii)&nbsp;bio&shy;markers of function.
Biomarkers of exposure are intended to measure
intakes of foods or nutrients using traditional dietary
assessment methods or
objective dietary bio&shy;markers.  Status bio&shy;markers measure a&nbsp;
nutrient in biological fluids or tissues, or in the urinary excretion of a
&nbsp;nutrient or its metabolites; these ideally reflect total body nutrient
content or the status of the tissue store most sensitive to nutrient
depletion.  Functional bio&shy;markers, subdivided into biochemical and
physio&shy;logical or behavioral bio&shy;markers, assess the&nbsp;functional
con&shy;sequences of a&nbsp;nutrient deficiency or excess.
They may measure the activity of a&nbsp;
nutrient-dependent enzyme or the presence of abnormal metabolic
products in urine or blood arising from reduced activity of the enzyme;
these serve as early bio&shy;markers of sub&shy;clinical deficiencies.  Alterations
in DNA damage, in gene expression and in immune function are also
emerging as promising functional biochemical bio&shy;markers.  Disturbances
in functional physio&shy;logical and behavioral bio&shy;markers can occur
with more severe nutrient deficiencies, often involving impair&shy;ments in
growth, vision, motor develop&shy;ment,
cognition, in response to vaccination, and the onset of, or an increase in, depression.  Such
functional bio&shy;markers, however, lack both sensitivity and specificity as
they are often also affected by social and environ&shy;mental factors.
Outlined here are the principles and
procedures that influence the choice of the three classes of bio&shy;markers,
as well as confounding factors that may affect their interpretation.  A
&nbsp;brief review of bio&shy;markers based on new technologies such as
metabolomics, etc., is also provided.  Methods for evaluating
bio&shy;markers at the population and individual level are also presented.

<h2 id="15.1">15.1 Biomarkers to assess nutritional status</h2>

<p>Nutritional bio&shy;markers are increasingly important with
the growing efforts to provide evidence-based clinical
guidance, and advice on the role of food and nutrition
in supporting health and preventing disease.  A&nbsp;nutritional
bio&shy;marker has been defined by the Biomarkers of Nutrition
and Develop&shy;ment (BOND) program as a&nbsp;biological
characteristic that can be objectively measured and
evaluated as an indicator of normal biological or
patho&shy;genic processes, and/or as an indicator of responses to nutrition
inter&shy;ventions <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Raiten DJ, Combs GF. (2015). Directions in nutritional assessment. Sight and Life 29: 39-44.">

Thus nutritional
bio&shy;markers can be measure&shy;ments based on biological tissues
and fluids, on physio&shy;logical or behavioral functions, and more
recently, on metabolic and genetic data that in turn influence
health, well-being and risk of disease.  Most useful are
nutritional bio&shy;markers that distinguish
deficiency, adequacy and toxicity, and
which assess aspects of physio&shy;logical function and/or current
or future health.

Increasingly, under&shy;standing the effect of diet on health requires the
study of mechanisms, not only of nutrients but also of other
bioactive food con&shy;stituents at the molecular level.   Hence,
there is also a&nbsp;need for molecular bio&shy;markers that allow the
detection of the onset of disease, in, ideally, the
pre-disease state.  Unfortunately, nutritional bio&shy;markers
are often affected by technical and biological factors other
than changes in nutritional status, which can con&shy;found the
interpretation of the results.  </p>
<p>
Nutritional bio&shy;markers are used to support a&nbsp;range of
applications at both the population and individual level;
these applications are listed below.
<p><b>At the population level </b>
<ul>
<li>
National Nutrition surveys:
assess overall nutritional status of populations
</li><li>
Nutrition Screening:  identify persons &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; in the population via
cut-offs
</li><li>
Surveillance:  con&shy;tinuous monitoring of
nutritional status of selected population groups over time
(e.g.,&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;NHANES and U.K.&nbsp;Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Program)
</li>
<li>
Monitoring and Evaluation:  monitor
coverage of / compliance with nutrition policies; evaluate
the efficacy and/or effectiveness of public health programs and
inter&shy;ventions over time; substantiate health claims.
</li></ul>
<b>At the individual level</b>
<ul><li>
In apparently healthy patients:
assess reserves, pool size, tissue amounts of the nutrient;
determine response to clinical treatment of a&nbsp;nutrient
deficiency or disease state
</li>
<li>
In &ldquo;sick&rdquo; patients:  determine
status for a&nbsp;specific clinical problem; reflect current
status of deficiency or clinical disease; predict future
risk of disease or long-term functional outcome if abnormal
values persist.
</li></ul>

<h3 id= "15.1.1">15.1.1 Classification of bio&shy;markers</h3>

BOND has classified nutritional bio&shy;markers into three
groups, shown in Box&nbsp;15.1, based on the assumption that
an intake-response relationship exists between the bio&shy;marker
of exposure (i.e.,&nbsp;nutrient intake) and the bio&shy;markers of
status and function.  Never&shy;the&shy;less, it is recognized that a
single bio&shy;marker may not reflect exclusively the nutritional
status of that single nutrient, but instead be reflective of
several nutrients, their inter&shy;actions, and metabolism.  In
addition, a&nbsp;nutritional bio&shy;marker may not be equally useful
across different applications or life-stage groups where the
critical function of the nutrient or the risk of disease may
be different.

<p>
<b>Biomarkers of exposure</b> are intended to assess what
has been con&shy;sumed,
and, where possible, take into account bioavail&shy;ability,
defined as the proportion of the ingested nutrient that is
absorbed and utilized through normal metabolic pathways

Biomarkers of exposure can be based
on measure&shy;ments of nutrient intake obtained using
traditional dietary assessment methods.  Alternatively,
depending on the nutrient, nutrient exposure can be measured
indirectly, based on surrogate indicators termed &ldquo;dietary
bio&shy;markers&rdquo;.  These are intended to provide a&nbsp;more objective measure
of dietary exposure that is independent of the measure&shy;ment
of food intake.
<p>

These biomarkers

 </ul></ul>
 <img src="tables/tabforbox.jpg" class="center" alt="Table">
</div>					 				

<b>Biomarkers of status</b> measure either a&nbsp;nutrient in biological
fluids or in tissues, or the urinary excretion rate of the
nutrient or its metabolites, often with the aim of assessing
where an individual or population stands relative to an
accepted cut-off (e.g.,&nbsp;adequate, marginal, deficient).
Ideally, the bio&shy;marker selected should reflect either the
total body con&shy;tent of the nutrient or the size of the tissue
store that is most sensitive to depletion.  In practice,
such bio&shy;markers are not available for many nutrients.
Furthermore, even if levels of the nutrient or metabolite in the
biological tissue or fluid are &ldquo;low&rdquo;, they may not
necessarily reflect the presence of a&nbsp;pathological lesion.
Alternatively, their significance to health may be unknown.
<p>
<b>Biomarkers of function</b> are intended to measure the extent of the
functional con&shy;sequences of a&nbsp;specific nutrient deficiency or
excess, and hence have greater biological significance than
the static bio&shy;markers.
Increasingly, functional biomarkers are also being used as substitutes for
chronic disease outcomes in studies of associations between diet and chronic
disease. When used in this way, they are termed
&ldquo;surrogate biomarkers&rdquo;; see
Yetley et&nbsp;al. (2017) for more details.
Functional bio&shy;markers can be
subdivided into two groups:  functional biochemical, and
functional physio&shy;logical or behavioral, bio&shy;markers.
In some cases
functional biochemical bio&shy;markers may serve as early bio&shy;markers
of sub&shy;clinical deficiencies by measuring changes associated
with the first limiting biochemical system, which in turn
affects health and well-being.  They may involve the
measure&shy;ment of an abnormal metabolic product in urine or
blood or the activity of a nutrient-dependent enzyme.
Alterations in DNA damage, in gene expression
and in immune function are also emerging as
promising functional biochemical bio&shy;markers,
some of which may become accepted as
surrogate biomarkers for chronic disease.
<p>
Functional physio&shy;logical and behavioral bio&shy;markers are more
directly related to health status and disease than are the
functional biochemical bio&shy;markers.  Disturbances in these
bio&shy;markers are generally associated with more prolonged and
severe nutrient deficiency states,
or risk of chronic diseases.
Examples include
measure&shy;ments of impair&shy;ment in growth, of response to
vaccination (as a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker of immune function), of vision, of motor
develop&shy;ment, cognition, depression,
and high blood pressure, all of which are
less invasive and easier to perform than many bio&shy;chemical tests.
However, these
functional physio&shy;logical and behavioral bio&shy;markers often
measure the net effects of con&shy;textual factors that may
include social and environ&shy;mental
factors as well as nutrition,
and hence lack sensitivity and specificity as nutrient bio&shy;markers

<h3 id="15.1.2"> 15.1.2   Factors that may con&shy;found the interpretation of nutritional bio&shy;markers </h3>

Unfortunately, nutritional bio&shy;markers are
affected by several factors, other than the effects of a
change in nutritional status, which may con&shy;found their
interpretation.  These factors may include technical issues
related to the quality of the specimens and their analysis,
participant and health-related characteristics, and
biological factors.  These factors are listed in Box&nbsp;15.2.
Knowledge of their effects on the bio&shy;markers for specific
nutrients is discussed more fully in the nutrient-specific
chapters.
<div class="box"><b>Box&nbsp;15.2.   Technical, health, biological and other
factors which may con&shy;found the interpretation of nutritional bio&shy;markers</b>
<ul><li>
Analytical quality performance factors:  accuracy,
precision, sensitivity, specificity, validity, predictive
value
</li><li>
Specimen-related limitations:  half-life (days,
weeks, months, years); stability (quality of the sample);
biological variation; storage; con&shy;tamination; hemolysis
</li><li>
Participant-related factors:  age, sex, ethnicity, race,
genetic predisposition to disease, physio&shy;logical state,
hormonal status, sup&shy;ple&shy;ment use, physical activity level,
lifestyle, environ&shy;ment, recent dietary intake
</li><li>
Biological factors:  homeo&shy;static regulation, diurnal and/or circadian
variation, fasting status; nutrient inter&shy;actions
</li><li>
Health-related factors:  medication use, inherited or
acquired diseases, inflam&shy;mation, stress; environ&shy;mental
enteropathy; obesity; unusual weight loss
</li></ul></div>
<p>
The influence of these factors (if any) on each bio&shy;marker
should be established before carrying out the tests, because
 these con&shy;founding effects can often be minimized or
eliminated (Box&nbsp;15.3).  For example, in nutrition surveys the effects
of diurnal variation on the con&shy;centration of nutrients such
as zinc and iron in plasma can be eliminated by collecting
the blood samples from all participants at a&nbsp;standardized time
of the day.  When factors such as age, sex, race, and
physio&shy;logical state influence the bio&shy;marker, the
observations can be classified according to these variables.
The influence of drugs, hormonal status, physical activity,
weight loss, and the presence of disease con&shy;ditions on the
bio&shy;marker, can also be con&shy;sidered if the appropriate
questions are included in a&nbsp;ques&shy;tion&shy;naire.

<div class="box"><b>Box&nbsp;15.3.  Strategies to overcome the effects of
con&shy;founders on nutritional bio&shy;markers</b>
<ul class="no-padding"><li>
Use standardized methods to collect, process, and analyze
</li><li>

</li></ul>
</div>
<p>
During an infectious illness, after physical trauma,
with inflammatory disorders, and with obesity and diabetes,
certain systemic changes occur, referred to as
the &ldquo;acute-phase response&rdquo;, to prevent
damage to the tissues by removing harmful molecules and
pathogens.  The local reaction is inflam&shy;mation.  During this
reaction, circulating levels for certain micro&shy;nutrient bio&shy;markers &mdash; for example, zinc, iron, copper, and
vitamin&nbsp;A &mdash; are altered, often due to a&nbsp;redistribution
in body compartments, but these changes do not correspond to
changes in micro&shy;nutrient status.  Hence, systemic changes
due to the acute phase response must be assessed together
with micro&shy;nutrient bio&shy;markers to ensure a&nbsp;more reliable and
valid interpretation of the micro&shy;nutrient status assessment
at both the individual and population levels.  Such systemic changes
can be detected by measure&shy;ment of elevated con&shy;centrations of
several plasma proteins, of which C&#8209;reactive protein (CRP)
and &alpha;&#8209;1&#8209;acid glyco&shy;protein are recommended

<h2 id="15.2">15.2 Biomarkers of exposure</h2>

Biomarkers of exposure can be based on direct
measurements of nutrient intake using traditional
dietary assessment methods, or indirect measurements
using surrogate indicators termed &ldquo;dietary bio&shy;markers&rdquo;.
<p>
<b>Traditional dietary assessment methods</b> include 24h recalls,
food records and food frequency ques&shy;tion&shy;naires, the choice
depending primarily on the study objectives, the characteristics
of the respondents, the respondent burden, and the available
resources.  Each method has its own strengths and
limitations; see Chapter&nbsp;3 for more details.
For all dietary methods, care
must be taken to ensure that infor&shy;mation on any use of dietary
sup&shy;ple&shy;ments and/or fortified foods is also collected.
Seasonality must also be taken into account where necessary (e.g.,
for vitamin&nbsp;A intakes).  In the absence of appropriate food
compo&shy;sition data for the nutrient of interest, duplicate
diet compo&shy;sites can be collected for chemical analysis.
<p>
Nutrient intakes calculated from  food compo&shy;sition data
or determined from chemical analysis of duplicate diet
composites represent the maximum amount of nutrients
available and do not take into account
bioavail&shy;ability.  The bioavail&shy;ability of nutrients can be
influenced by several dietary and host-related factors; see Gibson
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Gibson R. S. (2007). The role of diet- and host-related factors in nutrient bioavail&shy;ability and thus in nutrient-based dietary requirement estimates. Food and nutrition bulletin, 28(1 Suppl International), S77–S100.">

for a&nbsp;detailed discussion of these factors.
Unfortunately, factors affecting the bioavail&shy;ability of many
nutrients are not well understood, with the exception of
iron and zinc.  Algorithms have been devel&shy;oped to estimate
iron and zinc bioavail&shy;ability from whole diets and are
described in Lynch et&nbsp;al.

bioavail&shy;ability based on various dietary patterns can be used.
<p>
Given the challenges with the traditional dietary methods,
there is increasing interest in the use of dietary
bio&shy;markers as objective indicators of dietary exposure.
Dietary bio&shy;markers can be classified into three groups:
recovery, con&shy;centration, and predictive — each has
distinctive properties, as shown in Box&nbsp;15.4. Several criteria
must be con&shy;sidered when selecting a&nbsp;dietary bio&shy;marker.
These include the half-life of the bio&shy;marker, day-to-day
intra- and inter-individual variability, the requirements for
sample collection, transport, storage and analysis, and the
impact of potential biological con&shy;founders that may cause
variation in bio&shy;marker con&shy;centrations, unrelated to the level
of the dietary component of interest.
<p>
Examples for each of the three groups of dietary bio&shy;markers
are shown in Box&nbsp;15.4.  In general, nutrient levels in
fluids such as urine and serum tend to reflect short-term (i.e., recent)
dietary exposure, those in erythro&shy;cytes are medium-term (e.g.,
for fatty acids; folate), whereas examples of long-term
bio&shy;markers are nutrient levels in adipose tissue (for fatty
acids), toenails or fingernails (for selenium), and scalp
hair samples (for chromium).  In some circumstances, the
time integration of exposure of the urinary dietary
bio&shy;markers can be enhanced by obtaining urine samples at several
points in time.  For more specific details of nutrient levels in urine as dietary bio&shy;markers, see

Research on nutritional bio&shy;markers for assess&shy;ing the intake of
specific foods, food groups, or combi&shy;nations that describe
food patterns rather than nutrients <i>per se,</i> is also emerging
in an effort to improve the assess&shy;ment of the relationships
between diet, functional outcomes, and chronic disease.
Examples include urinary excretion of proline betaine as a
bio&shy;marker of citrus fruit; 1&#8209;methyl&shy;histidine and
3&#8209;methyl&shy;histidine as bio&shy;markers of meat con&shy;sumption; sucrose
and fructose as predictive bio&shy;markers of sugar intake;
alkyl&shy;resorcinol (in urine and plasma) as a&nbsp;possible whole

<h2 id="15.3">15.3 Biomarkers of status</h2>

Biomarkers based on nutrients in biological fluids and
tissues are frequently used as bio&shy;markers of status, and in
some cases, of exposure.  Measure&shy;ments of (a)&nbsp;con&shy;centrations
of a&nbsp;nutrient in biological fluids or tissues, or (b)&nbsp;the
urinary excretion rate of a&nbsp;nutrient or its metabolite can
be used.  The biopsy material most frequently used for these
bio&shy;markers is whole blood or some fraction of blood.  Other
body fluids and tissues, less widely used, include urine,
saliva, adipose tissue, breast milk, semen, amniotic fluid,
hair, toenails, skin, and buccal mucosa.  Four stages are
involved in the analysis of these biopsy materials:
sampling, storage, preparation, and analysis.  Care must be
taken to ensure that the appropriate safety precautions are
taken at each stage.  Con&shy;tamination is a&nbsp;major problem for
trace elements, and must be con&shy;trolled at each stage of
their analyses, especially when the expected analyte levels
are at or below con&shy;centrations
of 1&times;10<sup>&minus;9</sup>g.
<p>
Ideally, as discussed above, the nutrient con&shy;tent of the
biopsy material should reflect the level of the nutrient in
the tissue most sensitive to a&nbsp;deficiency, and any reduction
in nutrient con&shy;tent should reflect the presence of a
metabolic lesion.  In some cases, however, the level of the
nutrient in the biological fluid or tissue may appear
adequate, but a&nbsp;deficiency state still
arises: homeo&shy;static mechanisms maintain
con&shy;centrations within the biological specimen, even when
intakes are marginal or inadequate (e.g.,&nbsp;serum calcium, retinol or
serum zinc).  Alternatively, a&nbsp;metabolic defect may prevent
the utilization of the nutrient.

<h3 id="15.3.1">15.3.1  Blood</h3>

Samples of blood are readily accessible, relatively
noninvasive, and generally easily analyzed.  They must be
collected and handled under con&shy;trolled, standardized
con&shy;ditions to ensure accurate and precise analytical
results.  Factors such as fasting, fluctuations resulting
from diurnal variation and meal con&shy;sumption, hydration
status, use of oral con&shy;traceptive agents or hormone
replacement therapy, medications, infection, inflam&shy;mation,
stress, body weight and genotype are among the many factors
that may con&shy;found inter&shy;pretation of the results

<p>
Serum / plasma carries newly absorbed nutrients and those
being transported to the tissues and thus tends to reflect
recent dietary intake.  Therefore, serum / plasma nutrient
levels provide an acute, rather than long-term, bio&shy;marker of
nutrient exposure and/or status.  The magnitude of the
effect of recent dietary intake on serum / plasma nutrient
con&shy;centrations is dependent on the nutrient, and where
necessary, can be reduced by collecting fasting blood
samples.  Alternatively, if this is not possible, the time
inter&shy;val since the preceding meal can be recorded, and
incorporated into the statistical analysis and
inter&shy;pretation of the results

The risk of con&shy;tamination during sample collection, storage,
preparation, and analysis is a&nbsp;particular problem in trace
element analysis of blood.  Trace elements are present in
low con&shy;centrations in blood but are ubiquitous in the
environ&shy;ment.  Details of strategies to reduce the risk of
adventitious sources of trace-element con&shy;tamination are

In addition, for certain vitamins such as retinol and folate, exposure to
bright light and high temp&shy;erature should be avoided, and for
serum folate, suitable anti&shy;oxidants (e.g.,&nbsp;ascorbic acid,
0.5%&nbsp;w/v) are added to samples to stabilize the vitamin
during collection and storage

For trace element analysis, trace-element-free evacuated tubes with
silicon&shy;ized rather than rubber stoppers must be used.
<p>
Serum is often preferred for trace element analysis because,
unlike plasma, risk of adventitious con&shy;tamination from
anti&shy;coagulants is avoided, as is the tendency to form
an insoluble protein precip&shy;itate during freezing.
Never&shy;the&shy;less, serum is more prone than plasma to both
con&shy;tamination from platelets and to hemolysis.  For capillary
blood samples, the use of polyethylene serum separators with
polyethylene stoppers are recom&shy;mended
for analysis of trace-elements

<h3 id="15.3.2">15.3.2 Erythro&shy;cytes</h3>
<p>
The nutrient content of erythro&shy;cytes reflects chronic
nutrient status because the lifespan of these cells is quite
long (&asymp;&nbsp;120d).  An additional advantage is that nutrient
con&shy;centrations in erythro&shy;cytes are not subject to the
transient variations that can affect plasma.  The
anti&shy;coagulant used for the collection of erythro&shy;cytes must
be chosen with care to ensure that it does not induce any
leakage of ions from the red blood cells.  At present, the
best choice for trace element analysis is heparin

target="right" >Vitoux et&nbsp;al., 1999</a>). </span>
<p>
The separation, washing and analysis of erythro&shy;cytes is
technically difficult, and must be carried out with care.
For example, the centrifugation speed must be high enough to
remove the extra&shy;cellular water but low enough to avoid
hemolysis.  Care must be taken to carefully discard the
buffy coat con&shy;taining the leuko&shy;cytes and platelets, because
these cells may con&shy;tain higher con&shy;centrations of the
nutrient than the erythro&shy;cytes.  After separation, the
packed erythro&shy;cytes must be washed three times with isotonic
saline to remove the trapped plasma, and then homogenized.
The latter step is critical because during centrifugation
the erythro&shy;cytes become density stratified, with younger
lighter cells at the top and older denser cells at the
bottom.
<p>
There is no standard method for expressing the nutrient
con&shy;tent of erythro&shy;cytes, and each has limitations.  The
methods used include nutrient per liter of packed cells, per
number of cells, per&nbsp;g of hemoglobin (Hb), or per&nbsp;g of dry
material

As an example, erythro&shy;cyte
folate is expressed as &micro;g/L or nmol/L, whereas erythro&shy;cyte
zinc is often expressed as &micro;g/g&nbsp;Hb.  Concentrations of

<p>
Erythro&shy;cytes can also be used for the assay of a&nbsp;variety of
functional biochemical bio&shy;markers based on enzyme systems,
especially those depending on B&#8209;vitamin-derived cofactors;
for more details, see
<a href="#15.4.2">Section&nbsp;15.4.2</a>.
 In such cases, the
total con&shy;centration of vitamin-derived cofactors in the
erythro&shy;cytes, or the extent of stimulation of specific
enzymes by their vitamin-con&shy;taining coenzymes, is
determined.  Some of these bio&shy;markers are sensitive to
marginal deficiency states and accurately reflect body
stores of the vitamin.

<h3 id="15.3.3">15.3.3 Leuko&shy;cytes</h3>

Leuko&shy;cytes, and some specific cell types such as lympho&shy;cytes,
mono&shy;cytes and neutro&shy;phils, have been used to monitor medium-
to long-term changes in nutritional status because they have
a lifespan which is slightly shorter than that of erythro&shy;cytes.
Therefore, at least in theory, nutrient con&shy;centrations in these
cell types should reflect the onset of a&nbsp;nutrient deficiency
state more quickly than do erythro&shy;cytes.
<p>
However, several technical factors have limited their use as bio&shy;markers
of nutritional status.  They include the relatively large
volumes of blood required for their analysis, the necessity
to process the cells as soon as possible after the specimen
is obtained, the difficulties of separating specific
leukocytic components from other white blood cell types, and
unwanted con&shy;taminants in the final cell preparation.
Additional technical difficulties may arise if the nutrient
con&shy;tent of the cell types varies with the age and size of
the cells.  In some circumstances, for example during
surgery or acute infection, there is a&nbsp;temporary influx of
new granulo&shy;cytes, which alters the normal balance between
the cell types in the blood and thus may con&shy;found the
results.  Certain illnesses may also alter the size and
protein con&shy;tent of some cell types, and this may also lead
to difficulties in the inter&shy;pretation of their nutrient
con&shy;tent

Hence it is not surprising
that results of studies on the usefulness of nutrient
con&shy;centrations such as zinc in leuko&shy;cytes or specific cell
types as a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker of zinc exposure or status have been
incon&shy;sistent.  As a&nbsp;result, zinc con&shy;centrations in
leuko&shy;cytes or specific cell types were classified as &ldquo;not
useful&rdquo; by the Zinc Expert Panel

Several methods are used to separate
leuko&shy;cytes from whole blood.  They include lysis of
erythro&shy;cytes, isolating mononuclear cells by density
gradient separation, and various non-flow sorting methods.
Of the latter, magnetic bead separation can be used to enrich specific
cell popu&shy;lations prior to flow cytometric analysis.  Lysis
of erythro&shy;cytes is much quicker than density gradient
separation, and results in higher yields of leuko&shy;cytes with
good viability.  Never&shy;the&shy;less, density gradient separation
methods should be used when purification of cell popu&shy;lations
is required rather than simple removal of erythroid
con&shy;taminants.  When flow cytometry is used, cells do not
necessarily need to be purified or separated for the study
of a&nbsp;particular subpopu&shy;lation of cells. However, their
separation or enrichment prior to flow cytometry does
enhance the throughput and ultimately the yield of a&nbsp;desired
popu&shy;lation of cells.
<p>
Again, as noted for erythro&shy;cytes, no standard method exists
for expressing the con&shy;tent or con&shy;centration of nutrients in
cells such as leuko&shy;cytes.  Methods that are used include
nutrient per&nbsp;unit mass of protein, nutrient con&shy;centration
per&nbsp;cell, nutrient con&shy;centration per&nbsp;dry&nbsp;weight of cells,
and nutrient per&nbsp;unit of DNA.

<p></p>
In some settings, it is more feasible to collect breast milk
samples than blood samples.  Never&shy;the&shy;less, sampling,
extraction, handling and storage of the breast milk samples
must be carried out carefully to obtain accurate infor&shy;mation
on their nutrient con&shy;centrations.  To avoid
sampling colostrum and transitional milk, which often have
very high nutrient con&shy;centrations, mature breast milk
samples should be taken at least 21d postpartum, when the
con&shy;centration of most nutrients (except zinc) has stabilized.  Ideally,
complete 24h breast milk samples from both breasts should
be collected, because the con&shy;centration of some nutrients
(e.g.,&nbsp;retinol) varies during a&nbsp;feed.  In community-based
studies, however, this is often not feasible.  As a&nbsp;result,
alternative breast milk sampling protocols have been
devel&shy;oped, the choice depending on the study objectives and
the nutrient of inter&shy;est.
<p>
To date, only breast milk
con&shy;centrations of vitamin&nbsp;A have been extensively
used to provide infor&shy;mation about the vitamin&nbsp;A
status of  the mother and the breastfed infant

For the assess&shy;ment of breast milk vitamin&nbsp;A at the
individual level, the recom&shy;mended practice is to collect
the entire milk con&shy;tent of
one breast that has not been used to feed an infant for at
least 2h, into a&nbsp;dark glass bottle on ice.
This procedure is necessary because the fat
con&shy;tent of breast milk, and thus the con&shy;tent of fat-soluble
vitamin&nbsp;A, increases from the beginning to the end of a single feed

Before shipping to the laboratory, the complete breast milk
sample from each participant should be warmed to room
temp&shy;erature and homog&shy;enized by swirling gently, from which an
aliquot of the precise volume needed for analysis can be
withdrawn.  This aliquot is then frozen at &minus;20&deg;C in an amber

The analytical methods selected for breast milk should be determined by the

<h3 id="15.3.5">15.3.5 Saliva</h3>

Several studies have invest&shy;igated the use of saliva as a
biopsy fluid for the assess&shy;ment of nutritional status.  It
is readily available across all ages (newborn to elderly)
and collection procedures are noninvasive (unlike blood) so
that multiple collections can be performed in the field or
in the home.
<p>
Steroid and other nonpeptide hormones (e.g.,&nbsp;thyroxine,
testosterone), some therapeutic and other drugs, and
anti&shy;bodies to various bacterial and viral diseases, can be
measured in saliva.  The effect of physio&shy;logical measures of
stress such as cortisol and &alpha;&#8209;amylase on inflammatory
bio&shy;markers and immunoglobulin&nbsp;A (IgA) can also be
invest&shy;igated in saliva specimens

Increasingly, energy expenditure, determined by the doubly
labeled water (DLW) method, has been used to assess the
validity of reported energy intakes measured using a&nbsp;variety
of dietary assess&shy;ment methods

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31920966/"
target="right" >Burrows et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>). </span>

In the DLW method, at least two independent saliva samples,
collected at the start and end of the observation
inter&shy;val, are required to measure body water enrichment for
<sup>18</sup>O and <sup>2</sup>H; for more details, see Westerterp

Some micro&shy;nutrient con&shy;centrations in saliva
have also been invest&shy;igated as a&nbsp;measure of exposure
and/or status (e.g., zinc).  However, inter&shy;preting the results is
difficult &mdash; results do not relate con&shy;sistently to zinc
intake or status, and suitable certified reference materials

available.  Consequently, the BOND Zinc Expert Panel did not
recom&shy;mend salivary zinc as a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker of zinc exposure or

Some saliva specimens, depending on the assay, can be
collected and stored at room temp&shy;erature, and then mailed to
the laboratory without refrigeration.  However, before
collecting saliva samples, several factors must be
con&shy;sidered; these are summarized in Box&nbsp;15.5.
<p>
<div class="box"><b>Box&nbsp;15.5.  Factors to
be con&shy;sidered when collecting saliva samples</b>
<ul class="no-padding"><li>
Is resting or stimulated saliva required?  (Stimulated saliva can be

</li><li>
What volume of saliva is required for the assay?
</li><li>

</li></ul>
</div>
<p>
Collection of saliva can be accomplished by expectorating
saliva directly into tubes or small paper cups, with or
without any additional stimulation.  Participants may be
requested to rinse their mouth with distilled water prior
to the collection.  In some cases (e.g.,&nbsp;for the DLW
method), cotton balls or absorbent pads are used to collect
saliva.  These can be immersed in a&nbsp;preservative which
stabilizes the specimen for several weeks.  A&nbsp;disadvantage
of this method is that it may con&shy;tribute inter&shy;fering
substances to the extract and is therefore not suitable for
certain analytes.
<p>
Alternatively, devices can be placed in the mouth to collect
a filtered saliva specimen.  These include a&nbsp;small membrane
sack that filters out bacteria and enzymes (Saliva Sac;

or a&nbsp;tiny plastic tube that con&shy;tains cyclodextrin to
bind the analyte.  The latter device, termed the &ldquo;Oral
Diffusion Sink&rdquo; (ODS), is available from the Saliva Testing

entire collection period.

<h3 id="15.3.6">15.3.6 Sweat</h3>

Collection of sweat, like saliva, is noninvasive and
can be performed in the field or in the home.  Several
collection methods for sweat have been used:  some are
designed to collect whole body sweat, whereas others collect
sweat from a&nbsp;specific region of the body, often using some
form of enclosing bag or capsule.

have devel&shy;oped a&nbsp;method for
collecting whole body sweat involving the person exercising
in a&nbsp;plastic-lined enclosure.  The method does not inter&shy;fere
with the normal sweating process and overcomes difficulties
caused by variations in the compo&shy;sition of sweat from
different parts of the body.  The method cannot be used for
treadmill exercise but can be used for subjects exercising
on a&nbsp;cycle ergometer.
<p>
A&nbsp;method designed to collect sweat from a&nbsp;specific region of
the body involves using a&nbsp;nonocclusive skin patch known as
an Osteo-patch.  It con&shy;sists of a&nbsp;transparent,
hypo-allergenic, gas-permeable membrane with a&nbsp;cellulose
fiber absorbent pad.  The patch can be applied to the
abdomen or lower back for five days.  During the collection period,
the nonvolatile components of sweat are deposited on the
absorbent pad, whereas the volatile components evaporate
through the semi&shy;permeable membrane.  This method has been
used to study collagen cross-link molecules such as
deoxy&shy;pyridinoline in sweat as bio&shy;markers of bone resorption

It appears to avoid skin
encapsulation and hidromeiosis (excessive sweating) which
may alter sweat mineral con&shy;centrations, and captures sweat
with mineral con&shy;centrations similar to
those reported for localized patches.

Differences in the compo&shy;sition of human sweat have been
linked, in part, to discrepancies in collection methods.
Errors may be caused by con&shy;tamination, incomplete

<p>
Only fatty acids that are absorbed and stored in adipose
tissue without modification, and that are not synthesized
endogenously, can be used as bio&shy;markers.  Examples of fatty
acids that have been used include some specific n&#8209;3 and n&#8209;6
polyunsaturated fatty acids, trans unsaturated fatty acids,
and some odd-numbered and branched-chain saturated fatty
acids (e.g.,&nbsp;penta&shy;decanoic acid (15:0) and hepta&shy;decanoic acid
(17:0)).  Several other factors that influence the
measure&shy;ment of fatty acid profiles in adipose tissue must
also be taken into account; these are summarized in Box&nbsp;15.6.

Hair incorporates trace elements and heavy metals into the
matrix when  exposed to the blood supply during
synthesis within the dermal papilla.  When the growing hair
approaches the skin surface, it undergoes keratinization and
the trace elements accumulated during its formation become
sealed into the keratin protein structures and isolated from
metabolic processes.  Hence, the trace element con&shy;tent of
the hair shaft reflects the quantity of the trace elements
available in the blood supply at the time of its synthesis,
not at the time of sampling

noted that sweat from the
eccrine sweat glands may con&shy;taminate the hair with elements
derived from body tissues.  Other exogenous materials that
may modify the trace element compo&shy;sition of hair include
air, water, soap, shampoo, lacquers, dyes, and medications.
Selenium in anti&shy;dandruff shampoos, for example,
significantly increases hair selenium con&shy;tent, and the
selenium cannot be removed by standardized hair-washing
procedures

investigators have observed marked changes in
hair trace element con&shy;centrations after hair cosmetic
treatments.  The relative importance of these sources
remains uncertain, and standardized procedures for hair
sampling and washing prior to analysis are essential.
<p>
The currently recom&shy;mended hair sampling method is to use the
proximal
<span class="n">10&ndash;20mm</span> of hair, cut at skin level from the
occipital portion of the scalp (i.e.,&nbsp;across the back of the
head in a&nbsp;line between the top of the ears) with stainless
steel scissors.  This procedure, involving the sampling of
recently grown hair, minimizes the effects of abrasion of
the hair shaft and exogenous con&shy;tamination.  In addition,
the specimens collected in this way will reflect the uptake
of trace elements or heavy metals
by the follicles
<span class="n">4&ndash;8&nbsp;weeks</span>
prior to sample collection provided that the rate of hair growth
has been normal.  Before washing the hair specimens to
remove exogenous con&shy;taminants such as atmospheric
pollutants, water and sweat, any nits and lice should be
removed under a&nbsp;microscope or magnifying glass
where necessary, using Teflon-coated tweezers. For each sample details
of the ethnicity, age, sex, hair-color, height, weight,
season of collection, smoking, presence of disease states
including malnutrition, and use of anti&shy;dandruff shampoos or
cosmetic treatments, should always be recorded to aid in the
inter&shy;pretation of the data.
<p>
Some investigators suggest that the rate of hair growth
influences hair trace element con&shy;centrations.  Scalp hair
grows at about 1cm/mo, but in some cases of severe
protein-energy malnutrition

growth of the hair is impaired.  In such cases,

Several different washing procedures have been invest&shy;igated,
including the use of nonionic or ionic detergents, followed
by rinsing in distilled or deionized water to remove absorbed
detergent.  Various organic solvents such as
hexane-methanol, acetone, and ether, have also been
recom&shy;mended, either alone or in combi&shy;nation with a&nbsp;detergent

Washing with nonionic detergents
(e.g.,&nbsp;Triton&nbsp;X&#8209;100) (with or without acetone) is preferred
as nonionic detergents are less likely to leach bound trace
minerals from the hair and yet are effective in removing
superficial adsorbed trace elements.  Washing with chelating
agents such as EDTA should be avoided because of the risk of
removing endogenous trace minerals from the hair shaft

After washing and rinsing, the hair samples must be vacuum-
or oven-dried depending on the chosen analytical method, and
stored in a&nbsp;desiccator prior to laboratory analysis.  When
the traditional analytical methods such as flame Atomic
Absorption Spec&shy;trophotometry (AAS) or multi-element
Inductively- Coupled Plasma Mass Spec&shy;trometry (ICP-MS) are
used, washed hair specimens must be prepared for analysis
using microwave digestion, or wet or dry ashing.  In the
future, tetra&shy;methyl&shy;ammon&shy;ium hydroxide (TMAH) to solubilize
hair at room temp&shy;erature may be used, eliminating
time-consuming ashing or wet digestion

In summary, more data on other tissues from the same
individuals are urgently required to inter&shy;pret the
significance of hair trace element con&shy;centrations.  Hair is
certainly a&nbsp;very useful indicator of the body burden of
heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic.  It
is also valuable in the case of selenium and chromium, and

Nails, like hair, also incorporate trace elements into the

During the
growth of the nail, the proliferating cells in the nail
germinal layer are con&shy;verted into horny lamellae.  Nails
grow more slowly than hair at rates ranging from 1.6mm/month
for toenails to 3.5mm/month for fingernails, and, like hair,
are easy to sample and store.  In cases where nail growth is
arrested, as may occur in onycho&shy;phagia (compulsive nail
biting), nails should not be used

Unlike hair, no Standard Reference Materials presently exist for nail trace element
analysis.  Instead, in-house con&shy;trols prepared from
homogenous pooled samples of powdered fingernails and
toenails can be prepared and spiked with several different
known quantities of the trace element of inter&shy;est and the
recoveries measured.  Alternatively, an aliquot of the
in-house con&shy;trol can be sent to a&nbsp;reputable laboratory
and the results compared.  Likewise, there are no universally accepted
reference values for nail trace element con&shy;centrations,
limiting their use for assess&shy;ing risk of trace element
deficiencies in popu&shy;lations.  More studies comparing the
trace element compo&shy;sition of fingernails and toenails with corresponding

<h3 id="15.3.12">15.3.12 Urine </h3>

If renal function is normal, bio&shy;markers based on  urine or the urinary excretion rate of a&nbsp;nutrient
or its metabo&shy;lite can be used to assess exposure or
status for some trace elements (e.g.,&nbsp;chromium, iodine,
selenium), the water-soluble B&#8209;complex vitamins,
and vitamin&nbsp;C.
The method depends on the
existence of a&nbsp;renal con&shy;servation mechanism that reduces the
urinary excretion of the nutrient or metabo&shy;lite when body
stores are depleted.  Urine cannot be used to assess the
status of the fat-soluble vitamins&nbsp;A, D, E, and K, as metabo&shy;lites are not
excreted in proportion to the amount of these vitamins
con&shy;sumed, absorbed, and metabolized.
<p>
Urinary excretion can also be used to measure exposure to
certain nutrients, as well as some food components and food groups. Isaksson

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Isaksson B. (1980). Urinary nitrogen output as a validity test in dietary surveys. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 33(1), 4–5.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7355778/"
target="right" >1980</a>) </span>

was one of the first investigators to use
urinary nitrogen excretion levels in single 24h&nbsp;urine
samples to estimate exposure to protein intakes from a&nbsp;24h&nbsp;
food record.  Since that time, several urinary bio&shy;markers
for other nutrients, and for certain food components and food
groups, have been invest&shy;igated, in some cases as bio&shy;markers
of exposure or status, as noted in
<a href="#15.2">Section&nbsp;15.2</a>.
<p>
Urinary excretion assess&shy;ment methods almost always reflect
recent dietary intake or acute status, rather than chronic
nutritional status.  If infor&shy;mation on long-term exposure is
required, multiple 24h&nbsp;urine samples
collected over a&nbsp;period of weeks should be used.
For example, to obtain a&nbsp;stable
measure&shy;ment of long-term exposure to sodium, potassium,
calcium, phosphate and magnesium, three 24h&nbsp;urine samples
from healthy adults spaced over a&nbsp;predefined time period are
required <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Sun, Q., Bertrand, K. A., Franke, A. A., Rosner, B., Curhan, G. C., & Willett, W. C. (2017). Reproducibility of urinary bio&shy;markers in multiple 24-h urine samples. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 105(1), 159–168.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28049663/"
target="right" >Sun et&nbsp;al., 2017</a>). </span>
<p>
For some of the water-soluble vitamins (e.g.,&nbsp;thiamin,
riboflavin and vitamin&nbsp;C), the amount excreted depends on
both the nutrient saturation of tissues and on the dietary
intake.  Furthermore, urinary excretion tends to reflect intake
when intakes of the vitamins are moderate to high relative
to the requirements, but less so when intakes are habitually
low.  In other circumstances such as  infections,
trauma, the use of anti&shy;biotics or medications, and
con&shy;ditions that produce negative balance, increases in
urinary excretion may occur despite depletion of body
nutrient stores.  For example, drugs with chelating
abilities, alcoholism, and liver disease can increase
urinary zinc excretion, even in the presence of zinc
deficiency.
<p>
For measure&shy;ment of a&nbsp;nutrient or a&nbsp;corresponding metabo&shy;lite
in urine, it is essential to collect a&nbsp;clean, properly
preserved urine sample, preferably over a&nbsp;complete 24h
period.  Thymol crystals dissolved in isopropanol are often
used as a&nbsp;preservative <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Mente, A., Irvine, E. J., Honey, R. J., & Logan, A. G. (2009). Urinary potassium is a clinically useful test to detect a poor quality diet. The Journal of nutrition, 139(4), 743–749.">

For nutrients that are unstable in urine
(e.g.,&nbsp;vitamin&nbsp;C),  acidification
and cold storage are required to prevent degradation.
<p></p>
To monitor the completeness of any 24h urine collection,
urinary creatinine excretion is often measured (Chapter&nbsp;16).  This approach assumes that daily urinary creatinine
excretion is con&shy;stant for a&nbsp;given individual, the amount
being related to muscle mass.  In fact, this excretion can
be highly variable within an individual

A&nbsp;method has been devised for adjusting urinary
con&shy;centrations of nitrogen, sodium and potassium in cases
where the recovery of PABA is between 50% and 80%.  It is
based on the linear relationship between the PABA recovery and
the amount of analytes in the urine, as shown in <a href="#figure15.7">Figure&nbsp;15.7</a>,
and allows the use of incomplete 24h urine collections.
However, this adjustment method is not recom&shy;mended in cases
where PABA recovery is below 50%

Several investigators have measured urinary bio&shy;marker
con&shy;centrations of nitrogen, sodium and potassium to validate
dietary intakes in popu&shy;lation studies, some of which
assessed the completeness of 24h urine collection by
analysis of PABA con&shy;centration in the urine.

Estimates of intake from myfood24 were similar to the

potassium and sodium.  Such discrepancies may be attributed
to reporting error, daily variation in diet, and limitation
of food compo&shy;sition tables, especially for sodium as a

Twenty-four-hour urine samples can be difficult to collect

first-voided fasting morning urine specimens are often used,
as they are less affected by recent dietary intake.  Such

Special Bori-Vial vials con&shy;taining a&nbsp;small amount of boric
acid as a&nbsp;preservative can be used for the collection of
first-voided fasting samples.  Sometimes, only
nonfasting casual urine samples can be collected.  Such
casual urine samples are not recom&shy;mended for studies at the
individual level, because con&shy;centrations of nutrients and
metabo&shy;lites in such samples are affected by liquid
con&shy;sumption, recent dietary intake, body weight,
physical activity and other factors.
<p>
When first-voided fasting or casual urine specimens are
collected, urinary excretion is sometimes expressed as a
ratio of the nutrient to urinary creatinine in an effort to
correct for both diurnal variation and fluctuations in urine
volume.  For some urinary bio&shy;markers,
specific gravity has been used to correct for urine volume
in  casual urine samples rather than urinary creatinine

con&shy;centration of

school-age children, for example, indicates adequate iodine
nutrition.  However, this does not quantify the percentage

<p>
Daily iodine intake can be calculated from urinary
iodine based on the following assumptions:
over 90% of iodine is excreted in the
urine in the subsequent 24&ndash;48h;
median 24h urine volume is about 0.0009L/h/kg;
average bioavail&shy;ability of iodine in the diets is 92%.

\[\small \mbox {Iodine intake &equals; 0.0009 &times; 24/0.92 &times; Wt &times; Ui }\]
\[\small \mbox{ &equals; 0.0235 &times; Wt &times; Ui }\]
where Wt is the body weight (kg) and Ui is the urinary
iodine (&micro;g/L).

This equation has been applied to calculate
daily iodine intakes of children based on casual urinary
iodine con&shy;centrations collected during national surveys in
Kuwait, Oman, Thailand, and Qatar, and during a&nbsp;regional study in
China.  In these surveys, a&nbsp;secon&shy;d repeat casual urine sample
was collected in a&nbsp;random subsample of the children on a
noncon&shy;secutive day (<a href="#figure15.8">Figure&nbsp;15.8</a>).

<h2 id="15.4">15.4&nbsp;Biomarkers of function</h2>

Functional bio&shy;markers can be subdivided into
two groups:  functional biochemical, and functional
physio&shy;logical or behavioral, bio&shy;markers.  They measure the
extent of the functional con&shy;sequences of a&nbsp;specific nutrient
deficiency and hence have greater biological significance
than the static bio&shy;markers, as noted earlier
some functional biomarkers are also being used as substitutes
for chronic disease outcomes, when they are termed &ldquo;surrogate biomarkers&rdquo;
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Yetley, E. A., DeMets, D. L., & Harlan, W. R., Jr (2017). Surrogate disease markers as substitutes for chronic disease outcomes in studies of diet and chronic disease relations. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 106(5), 1175–1189.">

target="right" >Yetley et al., 2017</a>). </span>
<p>
Functional biochemical bio&shy;markers serve as early bio&shy;markers
of sub&shy;clinical deficiencies.  They may involve the
measure&shy;ment of an abnormal metabolic product in blood or
urine samples arising from a&nbsp;deficiency of a&nbsp;nutrient-
dependent enzyme.  Alternatively, for some nutrients,
reduction in the activity of enzymes that require a&nbsp;nutrient
as a&nbsp;coenzyme or prosthetic group can be measured.  For
example, the activity of erythro&shy;cyte glutamic oxalo&shy;acetic
trans&shy;aminase has been reported to better reflect the intake
of vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub> than the plasma con&shy;centrations of pyridoxal
phosphate, especially in adults &lt;&nbsp;65y

target="right" >Elmadfa and Meyer, 2014</a>). </span>
<p>
Changes in blood components related to intake of a&nbsp;nutrient
can also be determined, and load or tolerance tests
con&shy;ducted on individuals <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i>.  Sometimes, tissues or
cells are isolated and maintained under physio&shy;logical
con&shy;ditions for bio&shy;markers of <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i> functions.  Biomarkers
related to host defense and immuno&shy;competence are the most
widely used of this type.  For some of the nutrients (e.g.,
niacin), functional biochemical bio&shy;markers may not be
available.
<p></p>
In research settings, stable isotope techniques are used to
measure the size of the body pool(s) of a&nbsp;nutrient (e.g.,
the vitamin&nbsp;A con&shy;tent of the liver; see Chapter&nbsp;18), and for
kinetic modeling to assess the integrated whole-body
response to changes in nutrient status (e.g.,&nbsp;protein,
copper, zinc).  The latter approach is especially useful for
detecting subtle changes that may not be responsive to
static indices

measure, for example, mRNA for proteins (e.g.,
metallo&shy;thionein), the expression of which is regulated by
metal ions such as zinc

Correlations between bio&shy;markers of DNA damage and
micro&shy;nutrient status are also being invest&shy;igated in view of
the growing knowledge of their roles as cofactors or
as components of DNA repair enzymes.  For example, marginal
zinc depletion impairs DNA repair and increases the number
of DNA strand breaks.  However, these breaks are not
specific markers for zinc depletion as insufficient intakes
of choline, folate, and niacin also cause an increase in DNA
strand breaks

Genetic variation can
now be identified through DNA testing, and when used in
combi&shy;nation with nutritional bio&shy;markers, can assist in
under&shy;standing variations in metabolism and in identifying
sub&shy;popu&shy;lations at risk of disease; see
<a href="#15.7">Section&nbsp;15.7</a>.
<p>
Most functional physio&shy;logical and behavioral bio&shy;markers are
less invasive, often easier to perform, and more directly
related to disease mechanisms or health status than are
functional bio&shy;chemical bio&shy;markers.  In
general, however, functional physio&shy;logical or behavioral
bio&shy;markers are not very sensitive or specific and must be
inter&shy;preted in con&shy;junction with more specific nutrient
bio&shy;markers.  As noted earlier, these functional
physio&shy;logical and behavioral bio&shy;markers often measure the
net effects of con&shy;textual factors that often include social
and environ&shy;mental factors as well as nutrition.
<p>
Disturbances in these bio&shy;markers are generally associated
with more prolonged and severe nutrient deficiency states
or in some circumstances, risk of chronic diseases

important examples of functional bio&shy;markers
include the following:
<h4>Functional biochemical bio&shy;markers</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Abnormal concentrations of metabolic
products in blood or urine arising from reduced activity of
a nutrient-dependent enzyme (e.g.,&nbsp;urinary excretion of
xanthurenic acid, formimino&shy;glutamic acid (FIGLU), and
methyl&shy;malonic acid as a&nbsp;test of vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub> and
vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.
 </li> <li>
Changes in enzyme activities that depend on a&nbsp;given
nutrient (e.g.,&nbsp;erythro&shy;cyte glutathione reductase activity
for riboflavin; erythro&shy;cyte trans&shy;ket&shy;olase activity for
thiamin; erythro&shy;cyte glutamic oxaloacetic trans&shy;aminase for
vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub>).
 </li> <li>
Changes in blood
components (e.g.,&nbsp;whole blood hemoglobin for iron
assess&shy;ment; thyro&shy;globulin for iodine status; retinol-binding
protein for vitamin&nbsp;A; holo&shy;trans&shy;cobal&shy;amin for vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>).
 </li> </ul>
<h4>Functional physio&shy;logical and behavioral bio&shy;markers</h4>
 <ul>
<li><i>In vitro</i> tests of <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i> functions
(e.g.,&nbsp;lymphocyte proliferation for protein-energy, zinc, and
iron).</li> <li>
Load and tolerance tests and induced responses <i>in
vivo</i> (e.g.,&nbsp;Relative Dose Response:  load test for vitamin&nbsp;A;
CobaSorb test:  load test to assess vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>
absorption).
 </li> <li>
Induced responses <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i> (e.g.,
delayed-type hypersensitivity, often used to identify
protein-energy malnutrition).
 </li> <li>
Spontaneous <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i>
responses (e.g.,&nbsp;dark adaptation / vision at low intensity
for vitamin&nbsp;A; taste acuity for zinc; handgrip strength for

<h3 id="15.4.1"> 15.4.1 Abnormal metabolic products in blood or urine</h3>

Many of the vitamins and minerals act as coenzymes or
as prosthetic groups for enzyme systems.  During deficiency,
the activities of these enzymes may be reduced, resulting in
the accumulation of abnormal metabolic products in the blood
or urine.
<p>
<b>Xanthurenic acid</b> excretion in urine, together
 with other tryptophan metabo&shy;lites,
 is elevated in vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub> deficiency because the activity of
kynureninase in the tryptophan-niacin pathway is reduced.
This leads to the increased formation and excretion in the urine of
xanthurenic acid and other tryptophan metabo&shy;lites, including both
kynurenic acid and 3-hydroxyl-kynurenine.  Determination of urinary
xanthurenic acid is usual because it is easily
measured.
<p>
<b>Plasma homo&shy;cysteine concentrations</b> are elevated in
both vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> and folate deficiency.
In vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>  deficiency, when levels fall below 300pmol/L,
the activity of methionine synthase, an enzyme that requires
vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>, is reduced. This enzyme catalyzes
the remethylation of homo&shy;cysteine to methionine. Hence,
reduction in the activity of methionine synthase leads to increases in plasma
homo&shy;cysteine concentrations

<b>Methyl malonic acid (MMA) concentrations</b>

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> serves as a cofactor for the enzyme methyl&shy;malonic-CoA mutase.
This enzyme is required for the conversion of
methyl&shy;malonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Methyl&shy;malonic acid (MMA)
is a side reaction product of methyl&shy;malonyl-CoA metabolism,
and increases with vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> depletion.

<h3 id="15.4.2"> 15.4.2   Reduction in activity of enzymes</h3>

Methods that involve measuring a&nbsp;change in the activity of
enzymes which require a&nbsp;specific nutrient as a&nbsp;coenzyme or
prosthetic group are generally the most sensitive and
specific.  Often the enzyme is
associated with a&nbsp;specific meta&shy;bolic defect and associated
nutrient deficiency (e.g.,&nbsp;lysyl oxidase for copper,
aspartate amino&shy;transferase for vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub>, glutathione
reductase for riboflavin, trans&shy;ket&shy;olase for thiamin).
<p>
The activity of the enzyme is sometimes measured both with and
without the addition of saturating amounts of the coenzyme
added <i>in vitro</i>.  The <i>in vitro</i> stimulation of the enzyme by
the coenzyme indicates the degree of unsat&shy;uration of the
enzyme, and therefore a&nbsp;measure of deficiency.  When
nutritional status is adequate, the added coenzyme has
little effect on the overall enzyme activity, so the ratio
of the two measure&shy;ments is very close to unity.  However,
when a&nbsp;deficiency exists, the added coenzyme increases
enzyme activity to a&nbsp;variable extent, depending on the
degree of deficiency. Such tests, often termed &ldquo;enzyme
stimulation tests&rdquo;, may be used for vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub>,
riboflavin and thiamin, and employ the activities of
amino&shy;trans&shy;ferases, glutathione reductase and trans&shy;ketolase
respectively.  Erythro&shy;cytes are used for these enzyme
stimulation tests because erythro&shy;cytes are particularly
sensitive to marginal deficiencies and provide an accurate
reflection of body stores for vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub>, riboflavin, and thiamin.
Indeed, such vitamin-deficient erythro&shy;cytes
may respond to sup&shy;ple&shy;ments of B<sub>6</sub>, riboflavin, and thiamin
within 24 hours.
<p></p>
The test measures the extent to which the erythro&shy;cyte enzyme
has been depleted of coenzyme, and the results are expressed
either as the Activation coef&shy;ficient or as the Percentage Stimulation:

\[\small \mbox{Activation coef&shy;ficient = } \frac {\mbox {activity of the coenzyme &minus; stimulated enzyme}}{\mbox {activity of unstimulated enzyme}}\]

\[\small \mbox{Percentage Stimulation = }\frac{\mbox {stimulated activity &ndash; basic activity}}{\mbox{basic activity}}&times; \mbox{100%}\]

Also given are values for

Ideally, the assay selected should: (a)&nbsp;reflect the
amount of the nutrient available to the body, (b)&nbsp;respond
rapidly to changes in supply of the nutrient, and (c)&nbsp;relate
to the pathology of deficiency or excess.  Measure&shy;ment of
the copper-containing enzyme lysyl oxidase is an example of
an assay that fulfils these criteria.  Connective tissue
defects occur during the early stages of the copper
deficiency syndrome.  These defects can be attributed to the
depressed activity of lysyl oxidase inhibiting cross-linking
of collagen and elastin.
<p>
Many nutrients have more than one functional role
and thus the activities of several enzymes may be affected during the
develop&shy;ment of a&nbsp;deficiency, thereby providing additional
infor&shy;mation on the severity of the deficiency state.  For
example, in the case of copper, platelet
cytolysyl oxidase&shy;chrome&nbsp;c&nbsp;oxidase (Chapter&nbsp;24) is
more sensitive to deficiency than
plasma erythro&shy;cyte superoxide dismutase, the activity of which is  reduced only
in more severe deficiency states

RBP in serum is also
more stable, and easier and cheaper to analyze than retinol,
although as with retinol, levels are reduced during
inflam&shy;mation.  RBP is synthesized primarily in
hepato&shy;cytes as the apo-form and secreted bound to retinol as
the holo-RBP complex to provide vitamin&nbsp;A to peripheral
tissues; one molecule of holo-RBP binds to one molecule of retinol. However, RBP
is not secreted when stores of
vitamin&nbsp;A are low and retinol limited.  Because holo&#8209;RBP is complexed with
transthyretin, loss of holo&#8209;RBP to glomerular filtration in
the kidney is prevented.

Details are summarized in Chapter&nbsp;16.

<b>Other <i>in vitro</i> tests</b> include the erythro&shy;cyte hemolysis test

longer used.  In the former, the rate of hemolysis of
erythro&shy;cytes is measured; the rate correlates inversely with
serum tocopherol levels (Chapter&nbsp;18).  Unfortunately, this
test is not very specific, as other nutrients (e.g.,&nbsp;selenium) influence the rate of erythro&shy;cyte hemolysis.

<h3 id="15.4.5">15.4.5   Load tests and induced responses <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i></h3>

In the past, functional bio&shy;markers con&shy;ducted on the
individual <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i> included load and tolerance tests

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Solomons, N. W., & Allen, L. H. (1983). The functional assessment of nutritional status: principles, practice and potential. Nutrition reviews, 41(2), 33–50.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6346143/"
target="right" >Solomons and Allen, 1983</a>). </span>

Today, many of these tests are
no longer used and have largely been superseded by other
methods.
<p>
Load tests were used to assess deficiencies of water-soluble
vitamins (e.g.,&nbsp;tryptophan load test for pyridoxine,
histidine load test for folic acid, vitamin&nbsp;C load test),
and certain minerals (e.g.,&nbsp;magnesium, zinc and selenium).
In a&nbsp;load test, the baseline urinary excretion of the
nutrient or metabo&shy;lite is first determined on a&nbsp;timed
preload urine collection

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Robberecht, H. J., & Deelstra, H. A. (1984). Selenium in human urine: con&shy;centration levels and medical implications. Clinica chimica acta; inter&shy;national journal of clinical chemistry, 136(2-3), 107–120.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6362921/"
target="right" >Robberecht and Deelstra, 1984</a>). </span>
Then
a loading dose of the nutrient or an associated compound is
administered orally, intra&shy;muscularly, or intra&shy;venously.
After the load, a&nbsp;timed sample of the urine is collected
and the excretion level of the nutrient or a&nbsp;metabo&shy;lite determined.
The net retention of the nutrient is calculated
by comparing the basal excretion data with net excretion
after the load.  In a&nbsp;deficiency state, when tissues are not
saturated with the nutrient, excretion of the nutrient or a
metabo&shy;lite will be low because net retention is high.
<p>
<b>The relative dose response (RDR) test</b>
is the most well known functional <i>in&nbsp;vivo </i> load test in use today.
This test is accepted as a&nbsp;functional reference method to assess the
presence or absence of low vitamin&nbsp;A stores in the liver
(Chapter&nbsp;18).  However, in the RDR test, unlike the
con&shy;ventional loading tests described above, the response is
greatest in deficient individuals.  The principal of RDR is
based on the observation that in vitamin&nbsp;A inadequacy,
retinol binding protein (RBP) that has not bound to retinol
(apo&#8209;RBP) accumulates in the liver.  Following the
administration of a&nbsp;test dose of vitamin&nbsp;A (commonly in the
form of retinyl palmitate), some of the retinol binds to the
accumulated apo&#8209;RBP in the liver and the resulting holo&#8209;RBP
(i.e.,&nbsp;RBP bound to retinol) is rapidly mobilized from the
liver into the circulation.  In individuals with vitamin&nbsp;A&nbsp;deficiency,
a&nbsp;small dose of retinyl palmitate leads to a
rapid sustained increase in serum retinol, whereas in
vitamin&nbsp;A replete individuals, there is very little
increase.  An RDR value &gt;&nbsp;20% is con&shy;sidered to reflect
vitamin&nbsp;A stores of &lt;&nbsp;0.7&micro;mol/g liver

<b>The modified relative dose response (MRDR)</b>
has been devel&shy;oped as an alternative because
the RDR test requires two blood samples per
individual. The MRDR uses 3,4&#8209;dide&shy;hydro&shy;retinyl acetate
(DRA), or vitamin&nbsp;A<sub>2</sub> instead of retinyl palmitate as the
challenge dose, and requires only a&nbsp;single blood sample,
taken between 4 and 7h after dosing.  Serum is analyzed for
both 3,4,&#8209;dide&shy;hydro&shy;retinol (DR) and retinol in the same
sample, and the ratio of DR to retinol in serum is called
the MRDR value and used to indicate liver reserves.  Values
&ge;&nbsp;0.060 at the individual level usually indicate insufficient
liver reserves (≤&nbsp;0.1&micro;mol retinol/g), whereas values &lt;&nbsp;0.06
are indicative of sufficient liver reserves (≥&nbsp;0.1&micro;mol
retinol/g).  Group mean ratios of
&lt;&nbsp;0.030 appear to correlate with adequate status.  The MRDR
test has been used in numerous popu&shy;lation groups,  in
both children and adults worldwide. The values obtained, however, are
not useful for defining vitamin&nbsp;A status above adequacy.

bio&shy;markers of vitamin&nbsp;A status, see

<b>Delayed-type hypersensitivity</b> is a well known example
of a bio&shy;marker based on an induced response <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i>. This is a
direct functional measure of cell-mediated immunity used in
both hospital and community settings.  Suppression of cell-mediated
immunity signals a&nbsp;failure of multiple components
of the host-defense system.  The test involves injecting a
battery of specific anti&shy;gens intra&shy;dermally into the forearm;
those commonly used are purified protein derivative (PPD),
mumps, Tricophyton, <i>Candida albicans</i>, and
dinitro&shy;chloro&shy;benzene (DNCB).  In healthy persons re-exposed to
recall anti&shy;gens intra&shy;dermally, the recall anti&shy;gens induce the T&#8209;cells to respond
first by proliferation and then by the release of soluble
mediators of inflam&shy;mation, producing an induration
(hardening) and erythema (redness).  This induced response
is noted at selected time inter&shy;vals, and is often reduced in
persons with protein-energy malnutrition and micro&shy;nutrient
deficiencies such as vitamin&nbsp;A, zinc, iron and pyridoxine.
However, the test is not specific enough to detect
individual micro&shy;nutrient deficiencies

Functional tests based on spontaneous <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i>  responses
often measure the net effects of contextural factors that may
include social and environ&shy;mental factors as well as
nutrition. Hence, they are less sensitive and specific than
bio&shy;markers that assess nutrient

As a&nbsp;con&shy;sequence, they should be assessed
alongside more specific bio&shy;markers so that the functional
impact of the status of a&nbsp;specific nutrient can be
identified.
<p>
<b>Formal dark adaptometry</b> is one of several functional
bio&shy;markers based on spontaneous physio&shy;logical
<i>in&nbsp;vivo</i> responses that exist for vitamin&nbsp;A.
It was the classical method for assess&shy;ing
night blindness (i.e., poor vision in low-intensity light)
associated with vitamin&nbsp;A deficiency. This con&shy;dition arises when
the ability of the rod cells in the retina to adapt in the
dark, and the ability of the pupils to properly meter light in and out of
the eye, are impaired.  However, the
equipment used for formal dark adaptometry was
cumbersome, and the method very time-consuming, so it is no longer used.
<p>
<b>Rapid dark adaptation test (RDAT)</b> has superseded
formal dark adaptometry, with results that correlate with those of the classical method.
The test is based on the measurements of the
timing of the Purkinje shift, in which the peak wavelength
sensitivity of the retina shifts from the red toward the
blue end of the visual spectrum during the transition
from photopic or cone-mediated day vision to scotopic
or rod-mediated night vision. This shift causes the
sensitivity of blue light to appear brighter than
that of red light under scotopic lighting conditions.

The test requires a light-proof room, a light source,
a dark, non-reflective work surface, a standard X-ray view box,
and sets of red, blue, and white discs;
details are given in Vinton and Russell
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Vinton, N. E., & Russell, R. M. (1981). Evaluation of a rapid test of dark adaptation. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 34(9), 1961–1966. ">

The test measures the threshold of light at which pupillary contraction occurs
under dark adapted conditions. Minimal cooperation from the subjects is
required for the test which is performed in a darkened
facility, often a portable tent, and takes about 20min per subject.
Special pairs of goggles have
been invented to measure the pupillary response to light
stimuli — details are given in Chapter&nbsp;18.
<p>
<b>Capillary fragility</b> has been used as a&nbsp;functional bio&shy;marker
of vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency since 1913 because frank petechial
hemorrhages occur in overt vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency.  The test,
however, is not very specific to vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency states
(see Chapter&nbsp;19); static biochemical tests are preferred to
assess the status of vitamin&nbsp;C.

<b>Linear growth velocity</b> is also used as a&nbsp;functional

length for children &lt;&nbsp;2y and changes in height for older
children.  A&nbsp;high degree of precision is required for these
measure&shy;ments because two measure&shy;ments are needed.
During infancy, length increments can be assessed at 1mo
inter&shy;vals for the first 6mos and at 2mos inter&shy;vals from 6 to
12mos.  Increments measured over 6mos are the minimum
inter&shy;val that can be used to provide reliable data during

Seasonal variation in growth may
occur.  In high-income countries, height velocity, for
example, may be faster in the spring than in the fall and
winter.
<p>
The following formula is used to calculate velocity:
Velocity = (x<sub>2</sub> &minus; x<sub>1</sub>) / (t<sub>2</sub> &minus; t<sub>1</sub>) where x<sub>2</sub> and x<sub>1</sub> are values of
the measure&shy;ment on two occasions t<sub>2</sub> and t<sub>1</sub>.  Length or
height velocity is normally expressed as cm/y.  Currently,
no uniform criteria exist for defining growth faltering
based on growth velocity data, although in practice zero
growth in two con&shy;secutive periods is sometimes used

The assess&shy;ment of cognitive function requires rigorous
methodology.  Even with careful methodology, a&nbsp;relationship
between cognitive function and nutrient deficiency can
be established only by: (a)&nbsp;documenting clinically important
differences in cognitive function between deficient subjects
and healthy placebo con&shy;trols, and (b)&nbsp;demonstrating
improvement in cognitive function after an inter&shy;vention.
The individuals should be matched, and the design should
preferably be a&nbsp;double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized inter&shy;vention <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Lozoff, B., & Brittenham, G. M. (1986). Behavioral aspects of iron deficiency. Progress in hematology, 14, 23–53.">

<p>
Several measurement scales of cognitive function are available,
some of which are summarized briefly below.
<p>
<b>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development</b>
 are the most widely used method worldwide for assessing various domains
 of cognitive function in infants and toddlers

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Albers, C. A., & Grieve, A. J. (2007). Review of Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Develop&shy;ment--Third Edition [Review of the book Bayley scales of infant and toddler develop&shy;ment--Third edition, by C. A. Albers & A. J. Grieve].

(<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-06925-006"
target="right" >Albers and Grieve, 2007</a>). </span>

The third edition of the scales (Bayley&#8209;III)
measures child develop&shy;ment across five domains:
cognition, receptive and expressive language, motor,
adaptive, and social-emotional skills.  They were
con&shy;structed in the U.S. and have norms based on an American
sample, so cultural adaptions are often needed when using
them elsewhere.  Appropriate training and standardization are
a prerequisite to obtain reliable assess&shy;ment across testers.
<p>
<b>Ages and Stages questionnaire (ASQ&#8209;3)</b>, a parental screening tool, is
frequently used in large-scale research studies, as it is a cheaper, and a less
time-consuming measure of early childhood development.
The ASQ&#8209;3 con&shy;sists
of 30&nbsp;simple, straightforward questions covering five
skillsets of childhood develop&shy;ment:  problem solving,
communication, fine motor skills, gross motor skills, and
personal social behavior.  The ASQ&#8209;3 was also devel&shy;oped in
the U.S. to identify infants and toddlers 1&ndash;66mos
at risk of a&nbsp;develop&shy;mental delay

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25703316/"
target="right" >Steenis et&nbsp;al., 2015</a>). </span>
<p>
Several studies have compared the ASQ&#8209;3 with the Bayley scales
to assess develop&shy;mental level of infants and toddlers.
Substantial variations in the sensitivity and specificity of
the ASQ&#8209;3 across studies have been reported. Such variations may be due in part
due to differences in study design, study samples (high or
low risk), versions of the Bayley scales used, as well as
the countries in which the studies were con&shy;ducted.  In
several of these comparative studies, the ASQ&#8209;3 has been
found to have only low to moderate sensitivity

<b>Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence</b> is also used to assess cognitive
function at four ages: 27,29,39, and 52 weeks postnatal age
corrected for prematurity. The test is made up of 10 novelty problems, which comprise
one familiar and one novel stimulus presented simultaneously. All the stimuli
are pictures of faces of infants, women, and men. A novelty preference score
for each age is calculated as the average percent of time spent
fixating the novel picture across the 10 problems

<b>Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WISC)</b>
is designed for children age &nbsp;6y through &nbsp;16y&nbsp;11mos.
WISC&#8209;IV contains 10&nbsp;core subsets and five sup&shy;ple&shy;mentary
subtests. The core subsets consist of Block Design, Similarities,
Digit Span, Reasoning, Coding, Vocabulary, Letter-Number Sequencing,
Symbol Search, Comprehension, and Picture Concepts. The five
sup&shy;ple&shy;mentary subtests comprise infor&shy;mation, Word Reasoning,
Picture Completion, Arithmetic, and Cancellation.
The ten core subsets combine to form four composite index scores:
Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI),
Working Memory Index (WMI), and Processing Speed Index (PSI).
The Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) is derived
from the sum of the 10 core subtest scores

Of the micro&shy;nutrients, those most frequently
studied have been zinc, vitamin&nbsp;D, iron,
folate, and vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> in investigations in children, adolescents and the
elderly.  There have been reports of improvements in
patients with depression given sup&shy;ple&shy;mental zinc, especially
when the sup&shy;ple&shy;mental zinc is used as an adjunct to
con&shy;ventional anti&shy;depres&shy;sant drug therapy

<h2 id="15.5">15.5  Factors affecting choice of nutritional bio&shy;markers</h2>

Biomarkers should be selected with care, and their
limitations under con&shy;ditions of health, inflam&shy;mation,
genetic and disease states understood.  Several biological factors must
be taken into account when selecting nutritional bio&shy;markers
to assess nutritional status and these are discussed more fully in the
following sections.  They are also affected by non-biological
sources of variation arising from specimen collection and
storage, seasonality, time of day, con&shy;tamination, stability,
and laboratory quality assurance.  Both the biological and
non&#8209;biological sources of variation will impact on the
validity, precision, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and
predictive value of the bio&shy;marker.  Because almost all
techniques are subject to both random and systematic
measure&shy;ment errors, personnel should use calibrated
equipment and should be trained to use standard&shy;ized and validated
techniques which are monitored con&shy;tinuously by appropriate
quality-control procedures.

<h3 id="15.5.1">15.5.1  Study objectives</h3>

The choice of nutritional bio&shy;markers is strongly influenced
by the study objectives.
Nutritional bio&shy;markers can be used to determine the
health impacts of nutritional status at the popu&shy;lation
and/or the individual level.  At the popu&shy;lation level, factors
such as cost, technical and personnel require&shy;ments,
feasibility, and respondent burden are important
con&shy;siderations when choosing bio&shy;markers.  Popu&shy;lation-level
assess&shy;ment is used to develop programs such as surveillance,
to identify popu&shy;lations or sub-groups at risk, to monitor and
evaluate public health programs, and to develop evidence-based
national or global policies related to food, nutrition, and
health.
<p>
Nutritional bio&shy;markers are also used at the individual level
by clinicians to assess the nutritional status of patients
who are &ldquo;apparently healthy&rdquo; or &ldquo;apparently sick&rdquo;, or who have
sub&shy;clinical illnesses.  They may also be used to predict the
future risk of disease or long-term functional outcomes if
abnormal values persist, and to generate data to support
evidence-based clinical guidelines

The effects of genetic polymorphisms on the
clinical usefulness of bio&shy;markers are increasingly being recognized;
see <a href="#15.7.1">Section&nbsp;15.7.1</a>.
for more details.
<p>
Whether the study is at the popu&shy;lation or individual level
can influence, for example, the choice of a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker of
nutritional exposure.  To determine the risk of nutrient
inadequacy in a&nbsp;national survey, a&nbsp;single 24hr recall per
person (with repeats on at least a&nbsp;subsample) is required so that
the distribution of usual intakes can be adjusted
statistically. To assess the usual dietary intakes
of a&nbsp;patient for dietary counseling, a&nbsp;food frequency
ques&shy;tion&shy;naire or dietary history is often used.  For more
details of these dietary assess&shy;ment methods, see Chapter&nbsp;3.

<h3 id="15.5.2">15.5.2  Popu&shy;lation and setting</h3>

Factors such as life-stage group and ethnicity must also be
taken into account when selecting nutritional bio&shy;markers.
In studies during early infancy, local or national ethics committees may
prohibit the collection of venipuncture blood samples, and instead
suggest that less invasive bio&shy;markers based on urine, saliva, hair, or
fingernails are used.  Hormonal changes during
pregnancy, along with an increase in plasma volume
during the second and third trimester
affect con&shy;centrations of several micronutrient bio&shy;markers (e.g.,
serum zinc and vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>), making it essential to
identify women who are pregnant in order to ensure the correct
inter&shy;pretation of bio&shy;marker values.
<p>
Rural settings may present many challenges associated with
the appropriate collection, transport, centrifugation and
storage of bio&shy;markers; for example, it may be
difficult to ensure a temp&shy;erature-controlled
supply chain or &ldquo;cold chain&rdquo; for specimen collection.
Increasingly, serum retinol binding protein (RBP) is being used as
a surrogate for serum retinol in studies at the popu&shy;lation
level.   As noted earlier, serum RBP is more stable, and the assay is easier, cheaper, and correlates closely with serum retinol, provided
that the individuals tested are neither obese nor have abnormal kidney function

<h3 id="15.5.3">15.5.3  Validity</h3>

Validity refers to how well the bio&shy;marker
correctly describes the nutritional parameter of inter&shy;est.
As an example, if the bio&shy;marker selected reflects recent
dietary exposure, but the study objective is to assess the
total body store of a&nbsp;nutrient, the bio&shy;marker is said to be
invalid.  In U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;I, thiamin and riboflavin were analyzed
on casual urine samples because it was not practical to
collect 24h urine specimens.  However, results were not
indicative of body stores of thiamin or riboflavin, and
hence were con&shy;sidered invalid and thus not included in
U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;II or U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III

Valid bio&shy;markers are ideally free from random and systematic
errors and are both sensitive and specific.
Unfortunately the action of inflam&shy;mation, stress, or
certain medications,on enzyme activity and nutrient
metabolism may alter nutrient status and thus affect the
validity of a&nbsp;nutritional bio&shy;marker.  As an example, the
acute-phase response observed during an infectious illness
may cause changes in certain nutrient levels in the blood
(e.g.,&nbsp;plasma zinc may fall and retinol binding protein fall, whereas plasma ferritin increases), that do not reflect
alterations in the nutrient status <i>per se</i>, but indicate instead a
redistribution of the nutrient mediated by the release of
cytokines

In view of the possible effects of inflam&shy;mation on bio&shy;marker
levels, measures of infection status should be assessed
con&shy;currently.  For example, to adjust for the presence of
systemic inflam&shy;mation, WHO has recom&shy;mended the con&shy;current
measure&shy;ment of two inflammatory bio&shy;markers &mdash; serum

Depending on the bio&shy;marker, potential inter&shy;actions with
several physio&shy;logical factors such as fasting status,
diurnal variation, time of previous meal con&shy;sumption and

<h3 id="15.5.4">15.5.4  Precision</h3>

Precision refers to the degree to which repeated
measure&shy;ments of the same bio&shy;marker give the same value.  The
precision of a&nbsp;nutritional bio&shy;marker is assessed by repeated
measure&shy;ments on a&nbsp;single specimen or individual.  The
coef&shy;ficient of variation (CV), as determined by the ratio of
the standard deviation to the mean of the replicates
(SD/mean &times; 100%) is the best quantitative measure of the
precision.  Ideally, the CV should be calculated for specimens
at the bottom, middle, and top of the reference
con&shy;centration range for the bio&shy;marker, as determined on
apparently healthy individuals.  These same specimens then serve as
quality con&shy;trols.
<p>
Typically, the quality-control specimens used to calculate the
CV are pooled samples from donors similar to the study
participants.  It is important that these
quality-control specimens should, to the analyst, appear identical to the
specimens from the study participants.  This means that the
same volume, type of vial, label  and so on should be used.
<p>
Quality-control specimens should be inserted blind into each
batch of specimens from the study participants.  Both the
intra- and inter-run CVs should be calculated on
these quality-control specimens.  The former is calculated
from the values for aliquots of the quality-control specimens
analyzed within the same batch, and the latter normally calculated from the values for aliquots of the
quality-control specimens analyzed on different days

<p>
The precision of the measure&shy;ment of a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker is in part a
function of the random measure&shy;ment errors that occur during
the actual analytical process, and in some cases also a&nbsp;function of the
intra-individual biological variations that occur naturally
over time.  The relative importance of these two sources of
uncertainly varies with the measure&shy;ment.  For some
biochemical measure&shy;ments (e.g.,&nbsp;serum iron),
the intra-individual biological variation
is quite large:  coef&shy;ficients of
variation may exceed 30%, and be greater than any analytical
variation.  Consideration of intra-individual variation is also
important when assess&shy;ing dietary exposure, because nutrient
intakes of an individual always vary over time.  However, in
this case, the intra-individual variation is a&nbsp;measure of the
&ldquo;true day-to-day&rdquo; variation in the dietary intake of an
individual.  Strategies exist to account for the impact of
intra-individual variation on the measure&shy;ment of true usual
intake of an individual &mdash; see chapter 6 for more details.

The <em>attainable</em> level of precision  for the measure&shy;ment of any
particular bio&shy;marker depends on the procedure, whereas the
<em>required</em> precision  is a&nbsp;function of the study objectives.
Some investigators have stipulated that, ideally, the
analytical CV for an assay used in epidemio&shy;logical studies
should not exceed 5%.  In practice, this level of precision
is difficult to achieve for many assays and less precise measurements
in epidemio&shy;logical studies may result in
a failure to detect a&nbsp;real relationship of the nutritional
bio&shy;marker and the outcome of interest

Of note, as shown in <a href="#figure15.12"> Figure&nbsp;15.12</a>,
even if the&nbsp;precision is acceptable, the
analytical method may not be accurate.

<h3 id="15.5.5">15.5.5  Sensitivity and specificity</h3>

Sensitivity refers to the extent to which the bio&shy;marker
identifies individuals who genuinely have the con&shy;dition
under investigation (e.g.,&nbsp;a&nbsp;nutrient deficiency state).  Sensitive bio&shy;markers
show large changes as a&nbsp;result of only small changes in
nutritional status.  A&nbsp;bio&shy;marker with 100% sensitivity
correctly identifies all those individuals who are genuinely
deficient; no individuals with the nutrient deficiency are
classified as &ldquo;well&rdquo; (i.e.,&nbsp;there are no false negatives).
Numerically, sensitivity is the proportion of individuals
with the con&shy;dition who have positive tests (true positives)
divided by the sum of true positive and false negatives.
The sensitivity of a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker changes with the prevalence
of the con&shy;dition as well as with the cutoff point.
<p>
Biomarkers that are strictly homeo&shy;statically con&shy;trolled have
very poor sensitivity.  Figure&nbsp;15.1 shows the relationship
between mean plasma vitamin&nbsp;A and liver vitamin&nbsp;A
con&shy;centrations.  Note that plasma retinol con&shy;centrations
reflect the vitamin&nbsp;A status only when liver vitamin&nbsp;A
stores are severely depleted (&lt;&nbsp;0.07&micro;mol/g liver) or
excessively high (&gt;&nbsp;1.05&micro;mol/g liver).
When liver vitamin&nbsp;A
con&shy;centrations are between these limits, plasma retinol
con&shy;centrations are homeo&shy;statically con&shy;trolled and levels
remain relatively con&shy;stant and do not reflect total body
reserves of vitamin&nbsp;A.  Hence, in popu&shy;lations from higher
income countries where liver vitamin&nbsp;A con&shy;centrations are
generally within these limits, the usefulness of plasma
retinol as a&nbsp;sensitive bio&shy;marker of vitamin&nbsp;A exposure and
status is limited

<p>
Specificity refers to the ability of a&nbsp;nutritional bio&shy;marker
to identify and classify those persons who are genuinely
well nourished.  If the bio&shy;marker has 100% specificity, all
genuinely well-nourished individuals will be correctly
identified; no well-nourished individuals will be classified
as under-nourished (i.e.,&nbsp;there are no false positives).  Numerically,
specificity is the proportion of individuals without the
con&shy;dition who have negative tests (true negatives divided by
the sum of true negatives and false positives).
<p>
Unfortunately, many of the
health and biological factors noted in Box 15.2 and
diseases summarized in Table 15.6 reduce the
specificity of a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker.  Inflammation, for example,
reduces serum zinc (Table 15.5), yielding a
con&shy;centration that does not reflect true zinc status, so
misclassification occurs; individuals are designated &ldquo;at
risk&rdquo; with low serum zinc con&shy;centrations when they are
actually unaffected (false positives).  In con&shy;trast,
inflam&shy;mation increases serum ferritin, so that in this case
individuals may be designated &ldquo;not at risk&rdquo; when they are
truly affected by the con&shy;dition (false negatives).
<p>
The ideal bio&shy;marker has a&nbsp;low number of both false positives
(high specificity) and false negatives (high sensitivity),
and hence is able to completely separate those who genuinely
have the con&shy;dition from those individuals who are healthy.
In practice, a&nbsp;balance has to be struck between specificity
and sensitivity, depending on the con&shy;sequences of
identifying false negatives and false positives.

<h3 id="15.5.6">15.5.6    Analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity</h3>

Unfortunately, the term &ldquo;sensitivity&rdquo; is also used to
describe the ability of an <i>analytical</i> method to detect the
substance of inter&shy;est.  The more specific term &ldquo;analytical sensitivity&rdquo;
should be used in this con&shy;text.
<p>
For any analytical method, the smallest con&shy;centration that
can be distinguished from the blank is termed the
&ldquo;analytical sensitivity&rdquo; or the &ldquo;minimum detection limit.&rdquo;
The blank should have the same matrix as the test sample
and, therefore, usually con&shy;tains all the reagents but none
of the added analyte.  Recognition of the analytical
sensitivity of a&nbsp;biochemical test is particularly important
when the nutrient is present in low con&shy;centrations (e.g.,
the ultra-trace elements Cr, Mn, and Ni).
<p>
In practical terms, the minimum detection limit or the
analytical sensitivity is best defined as three times the
standard deviation (SD) of the measure&shy;ment at the blank
value.  To calculate the SD of the blank value, 20 replicate
measure&shy;ments are generally recom&shy;mended.  Routine work should
not include making measure&shy;ments close to the detection limit
and should normally involve analyzing the nutrient of
inter&shy;est at levels at least five times greater than the
detection limit.  Measured values at or below the detection
limit should not be reported.
<p>
The ability of an analytical method to measure exclusively
the substance of inter&shy;est is a&nbsp;characteristic referred to as
the &ldquo;analytical specificity.&rdquo;  Methods that are
nonspecific generate false-positive results because of
inter&shy;ferences.  For example, in U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;II, the radioassay
used gave falsely elevated results for vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>.  This
arose because the porcine intrinsic factor (IF) anti&shy;body
source initially used reacted both with
vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> and with nonspecific cobalamins present in
serum.  As a&nbsp;result, erroneously high con&shy;centrations were
reported and the samples had to be reanalyzed using a
modified method based on purified human IF, specific for
vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>

<p>
Strategies exist to enhance analytical specificity (and
sensitivity).  Examples include the use of dry ashing or wet
digestion to remove organic material prior to the analysis
of minerals and trace elements.

<h3 id="15.5.7">15.5.7  Analytical accuracy</h3>

The difference between the reported and the true amount of
the nutrient/metabo&shy;lite present in the sample is a&nbsp;measure
of the analytical accuracy (&ldquo;trueness&rdquo;) of the laboratory
test (<a href="#figure15.12">Figure&nbsp;15.12</a>).  Guidelines on choosing a&nbsp;laboratory
for assess&shy;ment of a&nbsp;nutritional bio&shy;marker are given in Blanck et&nbsp;al.

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12612175/"
target="right" >2003</a>). </span>
<p>
Several strategies can be used to ensure that analytical
methods are accurate.  For methods involving direct analysis
of nutrients in tissues or fluids, a&nbsp;recovery test is
generally performed.  This involves the addition of known
amounts of nutrient to the sample.  These spiked samples are
then analyzed together with unspiked aliquots to assess
whether the analytical value accounts for close to 100% of
the added nutrient.
<p>
As an additional test for accuracy, aliquots of a&nbsp;reference
material, similar to the sample and certified for the
nutrient of inter&shy;est, should be included routinely with each
batch of specimens.  If possible, several reference
materials, with values spanning the range observed in the
study samples, should be analyzed

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Blanck, H. M., Bowman, B. A., Cooper, G. R., Myers, G. L., & Miller, D. T. (2003). Laboratory issues: use of nutritional bio&shy;markers. The Journal of nutrition, 133 Suppl 3, 888S–894S.">

Research Laboratory, Birmingham, England.
<p>
The importance of the use of SRMs is highlighted by the
discrepancies in serum folate and red blood cell folate
based on the radioprotein-binding assay (RPBA)
and a microbiological assay.   By using the newly available
SRM for folate, U.S.&nbsp;NHANES established that values
based on the RPBA assay were
<span class="n">25&ndash;40%</span>
lower for serum folate and 45% lower for red blood cell
folate compared to both the microbiological method and that
using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Because  most of the cutoffs  to assess the adequacy
of folate status were established using the RPBA assay,
applying such mismatched cutoffs for the microbiological assay resulted in
risks of folate deficiency which were markedly higher (i.e., 16% vs 5.6% for
serum folate and 28% vs. 7.4% for RBC folate)

Important differences distinguish assays undertaken by a
hospital clinical laboratory from those completed during a
survey or research study.  Clinical laboratories often focus
on values for the assay that are <i>outside</i> the normal range,
whereas in nutrition surveys such as U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III), and in research
studies, the emphasis is often on con&shy;centrations that fall
<i>within</i> the normal range.  This latter emphasis requires an
even more rigorous level of inter&shy;nal laboratory quality con&shy;trol

<h3 id="15.5.8">15.5.8  Predictive value</h3>

The predictive value describes the ability of a&nbsp;nutritional
bio&shy;marker, when used with an associated cutoff, to predict
correctly the presence or absence of a&nbsp;nutrient deficiency
or disease.  Numerically, the predictive value of a
bio&shy;marker is the proportion of all results of the bio&shy;markers
that are true (i.e.,&nbsp;the sum of the true positives and true
negatives divided by the total number of tests).  Because it
incorporates infor&shy;mation on both the bio&shy;marker and the
popu&shy;lation being tested, predictive value is a&nbsp;good measure
of overall clinical usefulness.
<p>
The predictive value can be further subdivided into the
positive predictive value and the negative predictive value.
The positive predictive value of a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker is the
proportion of positive bio&shy;marker results that are true (the
true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and
false positives).  The negative predictive value of a
bio&shy;marker is the proportion of negative bio&shy;marker results
that are true (the true negatives divided by the sum of the
true negatives and false negatives).  In other words, the
positive predictive value is the probability of a&nbsp;deficiency
state in an individual with an abnormal result, whereas the
negative predictive value is the probability of an
individual not having the con&shy;dition when the bio&shy;marker
result is negative.
<p>
Sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence of the nutrient
deficiency or disease affect the predictive value of a
bio&shy;marker.  Of the three, prevalence has the most influence
on the predictive value of a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker.  When the prevalence
of the con&shy;dition is low, even very sensitive and specific
bio&shy;marker tests have a&nbsp;relatively low positive predictive
value.  In general, the highest predictive value is achieved
when specificity is high, irrespective of sensitivity.

<h3 id="15.5.9">15.5.9  Scoring criteria to select bio&shy;markers</h3>

can be used to select the appropriate bio&shy;markers in

<h2 id="15.6">15.6   Evaluation of the selected nutritional bio&shy;marker </h2>

At the popu&shy;lation level, nutritional bio&shy;markers
are often used for surveys, screening,
surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation (Box&nbsp;15.1), when
they are evaluated by comparison with a&nbsp;distribution of
reference values from a reference sample group
(if available) using percentiles or
standard deviation scores.
<p>
Alternatively, individuals in
the popu&shy;lation can  be classified as &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; by
comparing bio&shy;marker values with either statistically
predetermined reference limits drawn from the reference
distribution, or with clinically or functionally defined &ldquo;cutoff
points&rdquo;.  At the popu&shy;lation level, the bio&shy;markers do not
necessarily provide certainty with regard to the status of
every individual in the popu&shy;lation.  In con&shy;trast, when using
bio&shy;markers for the diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, or
counseling of individual patients, their evaluation needs to
be more precise, with cut-offs chosen accordingly

Normally, evaluation at the popu&shy;lation level requires a
distribution of reference values obtained from a
cross-sectional analysis of a&nbsp;reference sample group.
Theoretically, only healthy persons free from con&shy;ditions
known to affect the status of the nutrient under study are
included in the reference sample group.  For example, a
distribution of reference values for hemo&shy;globin (by age,
sex, and race) was compiled from
the U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;II based on a
sample of healthy, non-pregnant individuals.
Participants with con&shy;ditions known to affect iron status,
such as pregnant women and those who had been pregnant in
the preceding year, those with white blood cell count
&lt;&nbsp;3.4&times;10<sup>9</sup>/L
or &gt;&nbsp;11.5&times;10<sup>9</sup>/L,
with protoporphyrin &gt;&nbsp;70&micro;g/dL red blood
cells, with transferrin saturation &lt;&nbsp;16%, or with a&nbsp;mean
corpuscular volume &lt;&nbsp;80.0 or &gt;&nbsp;96.0fL, were excluded

with low serum albumin (&lt;&nbsp;35g/L), those with an elevated white blood

Inter&shy;national Zinc Consultative Group (IZiNCG) also took
age, sex, fasting status (i.e.,&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;8h since last meal),
and time of day of the blood sample collection into account,
in the reanalysis.  From these data, distributions of
reference values for serum zinc (by age, sex, fasting status

<h3 id="15.6.2">15.6.2  Reference limits</h3>

The reference distribution can also be used to statistically derive
reference limits  and also to derive a&nbsp;reference inter&shy;val.
Two reference limits are often defined, and the inter&shy;val
between and including them is termed the &ldquo;reference
inter&shy;val&rdquo;.  On average,
120 &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; individuals are needed
to generate the reference limits for subgroups within
strata such as age group, sex, and possibly race

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11805016/"
target="right" >Lahti et&nbsp;al., 2002</a>). </span>

The reference inter&shy;val usually includes the
central 95% of reference values, and is often termed the
&ldquo;reference range&rdquo; or &ldquo;range of
normal&rdquo;, with the lower 2.5<sup>th</sup>
percentile value often corresponding to the lower reference
limit and the upper 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile value to the upper
reference limit.  For example, the reference limit
determined by IZiNCG was based on the 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of
serum zinc con&shy;centrations for males and females aged &lt;&nbsp;10y
and &ge;&nbsp;10y, qualified by fasting status and time of blood collection

Similarly, in the U.K.&nbsp;national

represented by the 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile qualified by age and sex.  The

falling below the 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile value can then be calculated.

values, the reference distribution, and reference limits,
and how reference samples are used to compile these values.

to whether they are situated below the lower reference
limit, between or equal to either of the reference limits,

and for behavioral bio&shy;markers (e.g.,&nbsp;cognition;
depression).  Use of such bio&shy;markers
(with the exception of growth) is generally not feasible in
large-scale nutrition surveys.  Consequently, these
functional bio&shy;markers are often evaluated by monitoring
their improvement serially,
during a&nbsp;nutrition inter&shy;vention program.
Alternatively, observational studies have examined correlations
between a static or functional bio&shy;marker of a nutrient
and a physiological or behavioral bio&shy;marker.
These observational studies have comprised
cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies.
<p>
The observed values may also be compared
using cutoff points as described below.

<h3 id="15.6.3">15.6.3  Cutoff points</h3>

Cutoff points, unlike statistically defined reference
limits, are based on the relationship between a&nbsp;nutritional
bio&shy;marker and low body stores, functional impair&shy;ment or
clinical signs of deficiency or excess
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Raghavan, R., Ashour, F. S., & Bailey, R. (2016). A Review of Cutoffs for Nutritional Biomarkers. Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.), 7(1), 112–120.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26773019/"
target="right" >Raghavan et&nbsp;al., 2016</a>). </span>
The Institute of
Medicine (IOM) defines a&nbsp;cutoff for a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker as a&nbsp;&ldquo;specified quantitative measure used to demarcate the
presence or absence of a&nbsp;health-related con&shy;dition often used
in inter&shy;preting measures obtained from analyses of blood&rdquo; (IOM, 2010)
.
<p>
The use of cut-off points is less frequent than that of
reference limits because infor&shy;mation relating bio&shy;markers and
functional impair&shy;ment or clinical signs of deficiency or
excess is often not available.  Cutoff points may vary with
the local setting because relationships between the
bio&shy;markers and functional outcomes is unlikely to be the
same from area to area.
<p>
Cutoff points, like reference limits, are often age-, race-,
or sex-specific, depending on the bio&shy;marker.  For bio&shy;markers
based on biochemical tests, cutoff points must also take
into account the precision of the assay.  Poor precision
leads an overlap between those individuals classified as having low or deficient values
with those having normal values and thus to
misclassification of individuals.  This affects the
sensitivity and specificity of the test.  The Inter&shy;national
Vitamin&nbsp;A Consultative Group (IVACG), for example, now
recom&shy;mends the use of HPLC for measuring serum retinol
con&shy;centrations because this is the best method for detecting
con&shy;centrations &lt;&nbsp;0.70&micro;mol/L with adequate precision

The BOND Expert Panel has
recom&shy;mended cutoffs for the bio&shy;markers of exposure, status,
or function for six micro&shy;nutrients &mdash; folate, iodine, iron,
vitamin&nbsp;A, vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> and zinc, although for some (e.g.,
serum zinc), the so-called cutoffs are in fact statistically
defined and hence are actually reference limits.
Note that in some cases, the so-called cutoffs for status
or functional biochemical bio&shy;markers are assay-specific,
as discussed earlier for folate.   Assay-specific cutoffs
are also available for soluble transferrin receptor, a
useful biomarker for identifying
iron deficiency because it is less strongly affected
by inflammation. Assay-specific cutoffs arise when there
is no CRM available for the bio&shy;marker, as has been the issue for
folate and soluble transferrin receptor, until recently.
Different cutoff units are sometimes used, presenting an
additional challenge when interpreting data across laboratories

highlights how the use of differing cutoffs could affect the
prevalence of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in a sample
of U.S.&nbsp;elderly people (at least 60y) participating in
the U.S.&nbsp;NHANES surveys,
with estimates ranging from 3% to 26% (Yetley et&nbsp;al., 2011).
This means that in popu&shy;lation studies, prevalence estimates for
deficiency can vary according to the cutoff applied, which
has implications for nutrition public policy, and which may result
in unwarranted clinical inter&shy;ventions.  In some cases,
cutoff points for a&nbsp;nutritional bio&shy;marker vary according to
the functional outcome of inter&shy;est.  In the elderly, for
example, maximum muscle function has been associated with
25-OH-D levels &gt;&nbsp;65nmol/L, whereas reduction in
fracture risk is associated with higher serum 25-OH-D
levels

<b>Receiver operating characteristic </b>(ROC) curves are used to
evaluate the ability of a&nbsp;nutritional
bio&shy;marker to classify individuals with the con&shy;dition under investigation.  The curves
portray graphically the trade-offs that occur in the sensitivity and
specificity of a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker when the cutoffs are altered.  To
use this approach, a&nbsp;spectrum of cutoffs over the observed
range of bio&shy;marker results is used, and the sensitivity and
specificity for each cutoff calculated.  Next, the
sensitivity (or true-positive) rate is plotted on the
vertical axis against the true negative rate
(1-specificity) on the horizontal axis for each cutoff, as shown in

The closer the curve
follows the left-hand border and then the top-border of the
ROC space, the more accurate is the bio&shy;marker cutoff in
distinguishing a&nbsp;deficiency from optimal status.  The
optimal ROC curve is the line con&shy;necting the points highest
and farthest to the left of the upper corner.  The closer
the curve comes to the 45&deg; diagonal of the ROC space,
the less accurate the bio&shy;marker cutoff

Most statistical programs (e.g.,&nbsp;SPSS) provide ROC curve analysis.
<p>
The area under the ROC curve (AUC), also known as the
cut-point  &ldquo;<i>c</i>&rdquo; statistic or c-index, is a&nbsp;commonly used
summary measure of the accuracy of the bio&shy;marker cutoff.
AUCs can range from 0.5 (random chance, or no predictive
ability &mdash; a&nbsp;45&deg; line on the ROC plot, Figure&nbsp;15.4) to  0.75 (good),
and to &gt;&nbsp;0.9 (excellent).  The cutoff
value that provides the highest sensitivity and specificity
is calculated.  On the rare occasions that the estimated AUC
for the bio&shy;marker cutoff is &lt;&nbsp;0.5, then the bio&shy;marker cutoff
is worse than chance!  When multiple bio&shy;markers are
available for the same nutrient, the bio&shy;marker with the
highest AUC is often selected.
<p>
<b>Youden index </b>(J) is another summary statistic of
the ROC curve used in the inter&shy;pretation and evaluation of
bio&shy;markers. It defines the maximum potential effectiveness
of a&nbsp;bio&shy;marker.  The statistic J can be defined as  J = (maximum
sensitivity (c) + specificity (c) &minus; 1).  The cut-off that
achieves the maximum is referred to as the optimal cutoff (c*) because
it is the cut-off that optimizes the bio&shy;marker’s
differentiating ability when equal weight is given to
sensitivity and specificity.  The statistic J can range from 0 to 1, with
1 indicating a&nbsp;perfect diagnostic test, whereas
values closer to 0 signify a&nbsp;limited effectiveness

for the real-life situation (B).  Note that
the cut-offs finally selected can vary according to
whether the con&shy;sequences of a&nbsp;high number of individuals
being falsely classified as positive is more or less important
than the con&shy;sequences of a&nbsp;large number of individuals being
falsely classified as negatives.  Minimizing either
misclassification may be con&shy;sidered more important than
minimizing the total number of individuals misclassified.
<p>
Note that the sensitivity can be improved (i.e.,&nbsp;reducing
the false positives) by moving the cut-off to the right but
this reduces the specificity (false negatives), whereas
moving the cut-off to the left reduces the false negatives
(higher specificity) at the cost of a&nbsp;reduction in
sensitivity.  The former scenario may be preferred for the
clinical diagnosis of a&nbsp;fatal con&shy;dition, whereas cut-offs
with a&nbsp;high specificity may be preferred for diagnostic
tests that are invasive or expensive.
<p>
Misclassification arises because there is always biological
variation among individuals (and hence in the physio&shy;logical
normal levels defined by the bio&shy;marker), depending on their
nutrient require&shy;ments.  As well, for many bio&shy;markers there
is high within-individual variance, which influences both the
sensitivity and specificity of the bio&shy;marker, as well as the
popu&shy;lation prevalence estimates.  These estimates can be
more accurately determined if the effect of within-individual
variation is taken into account.  This can only be done by
obtaining repeated measure&shy;ments of the bio&shy;marker for each
individual on at least a&nbsp;sub-sample of the individuals.
The number of repeated measure&shy;ments required depends on the
ratio of the within-individual to between-individual variation for the
bio&shy;marker and popu&shy;lation con&shy;cerned (see analogous discussion
of adjustments to prevalence estimates for inadequate
dietary intakes in Chapter&nbsp;3).
<p>
The specificity of the diagnosis can be enhanced by
combining bio&shy;markers.  The presence of two or more abnormal
values can be taken as indicative of deficiency, often
improving the specificity of the diagnosis.  This approach
has been used in several national nutrition surveys for
diagnosing iron deficiency, including the U.S.&nbsp;NHANES in 2003.
Here a&nbsp;multivariable approach for estimating total-body iron
stores was devel&shy;oped based on the ratio of soluble
transferrin receptor to serum ferritin

Increasingly, a&nbsp;combined indicator is being used for diagnosing
B<sub>12</sub> deficiency that is based initially on 4 status bio&shy;markers
(serum B<sub>12</sub>, methyl&shy;malonic acid (MMA), holo&shy;trans&shy;cobalamin
(holoTC), and total homo&shy;cysteine (tHcy). However, the indicator can be
adapted for use with three or two bio&shy;markers; for more details see
Allen et&nbsp;al.

target="right" >2018</a>). </span>
<p>
In the future, a more flexible cutoff approach may be adopted in
which two cutoffs are provided, separated by a gray zone.
The first cutoff in this gray zone approach is selected
to include deficiency with near certainty, while the second
is chosen to exclude deficiency with near certainty.
When a bio&shy;marker falls within the gray
zone (suggesting subclinical deficiency), investigators are
prompted to seek additional assess&shy;ment tools in an
effort to provide a more precise diagnosis. In this way,
unwarranted clinical interventions are avoided (Raghaven et&nbsp;al., 2016).

<h3 id="15.6.4">15.6.4  Trigger levels for surveillance and public health decision
making</h3>
<p>
In popu&shy;lation studies, cutoff points may be combined with
trigger levels to set the level of an indicator (or a
combi&shy;nation of indicators) at which a&nbsp;public health problem exists of a
specified level of con&shy;cern.  Trigger levels may highlight
regions, popu&shy;lations or sub-groups where specific nutrient
deficiencies are likely to occur, or may serve to monitor
and evaluate inter&shy;vention programs.  They should, however,
be inter&shy;preted with caution because they have not always been
validated in popu&shy;lation-based surveys.  Box&nbsp;15.13 presents
examples of trigger levels for zinc bio&shy;markers set by the
Inter&shy;national Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group (IZiNCG).
<div class="box"><b>Box&nbsp;15.13.  Trigger levels

WHO (2011) have classified the public health significance
of anemia at the popu&shy;lation level based on the prevalence of low
hemo&shy;globin concentrations. Moreover, reductions in the
prevalence of anemia are targets for public health efforts
in many low-income countries. To be successful, however,
such efforts must address the multifactorial etiology of anemia,
and avoid the presumption that anemia is synonymous
with nutritional iron deficiency (Raiten et&nbsp;al., 2012).

A generalized discussion of the specific
procedures used for the evaluation of dietary,
anthropometric, laboratory, and clinical
methods of nutritional assess&shy;ment are discussed

26, respectively.

<h2 id="15.7">15.7 Application of new technologies</h2>

With the development of new technologies, the focus is
changing from the use of bio&shy;markers that are associated
with specific biochemical pathways to methods
that assess the activity of multiple macro- and micro-nutrients and their interactions within complex physiological systems. These new technologies apply
 &ldquo;omics&rdquo; techniques that allow the simultaneous
large-scale measurements of multiple genes, proteins,
or metabo&shy;lites, coupled with statistical and
bioinformatics tools. Such measurements offer
the possibility of characterizing alterations associated
with disease conditions, or exposure to food components.
However, further work on the development and
implementation of appropriate quality control systems
for  &ldquo;omics&rdquo; techniques is required.
A brief description  of these  &ldquo;omics&rdquo; techniques
and their application in nutritional assess&shy;ment follows.

<h3 id="15.7.1">15.7.1 Nutrigenetics </h3>

Nutrigenetics focuses on under&shy;standing how genomic variants
interact with dietary factors and the implications
of such interactions on health outcomes
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Mathers J. C. (2017). Nutrigenomics in the modern era. The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 76(3), 265–275.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27819203/"
target="right" >Mathers, 2017</a>). </span>
Nutrigenetics is being used increasingly to predict the risk
of developing chronic diseases, explain their etiology,
and personalize nutrition interventions to prevent and treat chronic diseases.
<p>
Nutrigenetics uses a combi&shy;nation of
recombinant DNA technology, DNA sequencing methods,
and bioinformatics to sequence, assemble, and analyse the structure
and function of genomes. Genetic variation among individuals is minimal.
Never&shy;the&shy;less, there is approximately 1% genetic variation
that can lead to a wide variability in health outcomes,
depending on dietary intake and other environ&shy;mental exposures.
The most common type of genetic variability
among individuals is the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
which is a base change in the DNA sequence.
With the development of genetic SNP databases,
individuals can be screened for genetic variations,
some of which can have an effect on an individual's health.
<p>
One of the earliest examples is the effect of the common
SNP&#8209;C677T (A22V) associated with the MTHFR gene.
This C677T polymorphism is responsible for a genetic defect in the enzyme
methylene&shy;tetra&shy;hydro&shy;folate reductase (MTHFR)
that can cause a severe or a more moderate
accumulation of homo&shy;cysteine.  Several studies in both
younger and older subjects have shown that
individuals homo&shy;zygous for the MTHFR
poly&shy;morphism C677T (A222V) have increased
levels of plasma homo&shy;cysteine concen&shy;trations,
although only in the face of low folate status.
No association has been found in homo&shy;zygotes
with adequate folate status. In view of the
influence of MTHFR C677T (A222V) poly&shy;morphism
on plasma homo&shy;cysteine, this C677T poly&shy;morphism
has been proposed
as an independent risk factor for coronary
heart disease
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Gibney, M. J., & Gibney, E. R. (2004). Diet, genes and disease: implications for nutrition policy. The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 63(3), 491–500.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15373962/"
target="right" >Gibney and Gibney, 2004</a>). </span>
Since this early example, there have been several
other reports in which   poly&shy;morphisms have been
associated with common chronic diseases through
inter&shy;actions with the intake of both micro&shy;nutrients
and macro&shy;nutrients, as well as with the
consumption of particular foods and dietary patterns.
<p>
Chronic diseases such as obesity,
type&nbsp;2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease
are probably associated
with multiple genetic variants that interact with diet and
other environ&shy;mental exposures. Therefore,
predictive testing based on a single genetic marker for
these chronic diseases is likely to be of limited value.
As a result, increasingly, studies are combining
genetic poly&shy;morphisms to yield
genetic-pre&shy;disposition scores, often termed
genetic risk scores (GRS), in an effort to examine
the cumulative effect of SNPs on diet interactions and
susceptibility to diseases such as obesity and type&nbsp;2 diabetes.
<p>
As an example, the use of a GRS has been applied in
studies examining the inter&shy;actions between genetic
predis&shy;position and con&shy;sumption of certain
foods in relation to body mass index and obesity.
In several prospective cohort studies, an interaction

beverages

These findings have high&shy;lighted
the import&shy;ance of reducing consumption of these foods
in individuals genetically predisposed to obesity.
<p>
Interactions between dietary patterns and GRS may also
be associated with adiposity-related outcomes.
In a large study based on 18&nbsp;cohorts of European ancestry,
nominally significant associations were observed
between diet score and a GRS based on 14&nbsp;variants
commonly associated with BMI-adjusted waist-hip ratio.
Moreover, stronger genetic effects were observed in
those individuals with a higher diet score (i.e., those
consuming healthier diets)

is uncertain, and further experimental

<p>
Clearly, advances in nutrigenetics have the potential to
enhance the prediction for risk of developing
chronic diseases, as well as personalizing their
prevention and treatment. Indeed, increasingly,
genetic tests are being used to customize
diets based on the predisposition to weight
gain by saturated fat intake and the increased risk of
developing hyper&shy;tension by high salt intake.

<h3 id="15.7.2">15.7.2 Proteomics </h3>

Proteomics refers to the systematic identification
and quantification of the overall protein content of a
cell, tissue, or an organism. The proteome is defined
as a dynamic collection of proteins that demon&shy;strate
variation between individuals, between cell types,
and between entities of the same type but
under different pathological or physiological conditions
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Huber L. A. (2003). Is proteomics heading in the wrong direction?. Nature reviews. Molecular cell biology, 4(1), 74–80. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12511871/"
target="right" >Huber, 2003</a>). </span>
<p>
Comparison of proteome profiles between
differing physiologic and disease states is
used to identify potential bio&shy;markers for the
early diagnosis and prognosis of disease states,
monitoring disease development,
under&shy;standing pathogenic mechanisms,
and for developing targets for treatment and therapeutic intervention.
<p>
Three major steps are involved in proteomics
analysis: (i) sample preparation; (ii) separation
and purification of complex proteins, and (iii) protein identification.
Several methods can be used to separate
and purify the samples, including chrom&shy;ato&shy;graphy-based
techniques, enzyme-linked immuno&shy;sorbent assays (ELISA)
or Western blotting. More advanced techniques
are also being used such as protein microarrays and
two-dimensional difference in&#8209;gel electrophoresis (DIGE).
To identify proteins in great depth, mass-spec&shy;trometry-based
proteomics is used to measure the highly accurate mass
and fragmentation spectra of peptides derived
from sequence-specific digestion of proteins.
Finally, the raw data from mass spectrometry (MS)
are searched using database search engines and
software such as MASCOT or Protein-Pilot, etc.
For more details of these techniques, see Aslam et&nbsp;al.
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Aslam, B., Basit, M., Nisar, M. A., Khurshid, M., & Rasool, M. H. (2017). Proteomics: Technologies and Their Applications. Journal of chromatographic science, 55(2), 182–196. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28087761/"
target="right" >2017</a>). </span>
<p>
Further work is required to improve the repro&shy;ducibility
and perform&shy;ance of proteomics tools. Systematic errors
can be introduced during each step that may artificially
discriminate disease from non-disease. Sources of
biological and analytical variation have not always been
controlled and the sample size for testing a
candidate bio&shy;marker has sometimes been
inadequate. However, with improvements, proteomics
has the potential to screen large cohorts for
multiple bio&shy;markers, and to identify protein
patterns characteristic of particular health or disease states.

<h3 id="15.7.3">15.7.3 Meta&shy;bolomics </h3>

Meta&shy;bolomics characterizes the small molecular
weight molecules, called meta&shy;bolites, that are
present in human biofluids, cells, and tissues at
any given time
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Brennan L. (2013). Metabolomics in nutrition research: current status and perspectives. Biochemical Society transactions, 41(2), 670–673.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23514174/"
target="right" >Brennan, 2013</a>). </span>
The aim of meta&shy;bolomics
is to provide an overview of the meta&shy;bolic status and
global biochemical events associated with a cellular or
biological system under different biological conditions.
The meta&shy;bolome is comprised of small intermediary
molecules and products of meta&shy;bolism, including
those associated with energy storage and utilization,
precursors to proteins and carbohydrates,
regulators of gene expression, and signalling molecules.
<p>
Five major steps are involved in meta&shy;bolomics: (i) experimental
design; (ii) sample preparation; (iii) data acquisition
by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or
mass spectrometry-based analysis; (iv) data processing;
and (v) statistical analyses
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="O'Gorman, A., & Brennan, L. (2017). The role of metabolomics in determination of new dietary biomarkers. The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 76(3), 295–302.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28091346/"
target="right" >O'Gorman and Brennan, 2017</a>). </span>
Computational tools have been devel&shy;oped to relate the structure
of the meta&shy;bolites identified to biochemical pathways.
This is a complex task as a meta&shy;bolite may
belong to more than one pathway; see Misra
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Misra B. B. (2018). New tools and resources in metabolomics: 2016-2017. Electrophoresis, 39(7), 909–923.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29292835/"
target="right" >2018</a>). </span>
<p>
The biofluids most widely used for meta&shy;bolomics
are blood, urine, and saliva. Several analytical techniques
are used to analyze meta&shy;bolites in these biofluids;
each technique has advantages and disadvantages.
The major analytical techniques are NMR spectroscopy
or mass spectrometry-(MS)-based
methods (e.g., gas chrom&shy;atography (GC)-MS, liquid
chrom&shy;atography (LC)-MS, capillary electrophoresis (CE)-MS)
and high performance liquid chrom&shy;atography (HPLC).
No single technique is capable of measuring the entire meta&shy;bolome.
<p>
Both non-targeted and targeted meta&shy;bolomics can be used,
depending on the research question. The non-targeted approach aims to
measure as many meta&shy;bolites as possible in a
biological sample simultaneously, thus providing a broad coverage
of meta&shy;bolites, and an opportunity for novel target
discovery. In contrast, the targeted approach involves
measuring one meta&shy;bolite or a specific class of known meta&shy;bolites with similar chemical structures. This requires the meta&shy;bolites of
 interest to be known <i>a&nbsp;priori</i> and commercially
 available in a purified form for use as internal
 standards so that the amount of a targeted meta&shy;bolite
 can be quantified

 Currently, there are no standardized protocols for
 sample collection and storage for meta&shy;bolomic studies.
 <p>
There are three main applications of meta&shy;bolomics in nutrition
research: (i) dietary intervention studies; (ii) diet-related disease
studies;  and (iii) dietary bio&shy;marker studies designed to identify and
validate novel bio&shy;markers of nutrient exposure

<b>Dietary intervention studies</b> can be used to investigate
the mechanistic effects of the intervention and to determine
the impact of specific foods or diets on meta&shy;bolic
pathways. An example includes the application of meta&shy;bolomics
to investigate the impact of consuming either
wholegrain rye bread or refined wheat bread. Meta&shy;bolomics of
serum samples from 33&nbsp; post&shy;meno&shy;pausal women
indicated that consumption of rye bread decreased
the branched chain amino acids leucine and iso-leucine and
increased NN-dimethyl&shy;glycine. Such alterations suggest
that wholegrain rye bread may confer beneficial

 30&nbsp;participants were
classified into low and high anxiety traits using
validated psychological questionnaires.
Participants then received 40g dark chocolate daily
for 14d during which urine and plasma were
collected at baseline, mid-line, and endline.
Consumption of dark chocolate for 14d was reported to
reduce stress related molecules in the
urine (i.e., cortisol and catecholamines) and partially normalized
levels of glycine, citrate, trans-aconitate,
proline, and &beta;&#8209;alanine in those participants with a
high anxiety trait compared to those with a
low anxiety trait. These findings indicated alterations in
stress-related energy metabolism

<b>Diet-related diseases</b> such as type&nbsp;2 diabetes
and cardiovascular disease have been investigated
by metabolomics in an effort to under&shy;stand their
etiology and identify new bio&shy;markers.  There is
now strong evidence that elevated plasma levels of branched
chain amino acids (BCAAs) (i.e., leucine, isoleucine, and valine)
and their derivatives are linked to the risk of
developing insulin resistance and type&nbsp;2 diabetes.
Moreover, depending on the metabo&shy;lite, changes
may be apparent as long as 13 years ahead of clinical manifestations
of type&nbsp;2 diabetes. Several investigators have also shown that
BCAAs and related metabo&shy;lites are also associated with
coronary heart disease, even when controlled for diabetes.

With the accumulating evidence of the importance of the
gut microbiota in the development of certain diseases,
metabolomics is also being used to identify
metabo&shy;lites that originate from gut microbial
metabolism, and follow alterations that may occur

Never&shy;the&shy;less, some of the findings reported from
metabolomics studies have been contradictory,
highlighting the need for further research before
metabolomic results can be translated into clinical applications.

<b>Dietary bio&shy;marker studies</b> are being explored to
overcome some of the limitations of traditional
dietary assess&shy;ment methods, and thus improve the assess&shy;ment of the
relationship between diet and chronic disease.
The food metabolome (i.e., metabo&shy;lites derived
from foods, and food constituents) is a promising resource
to discover novel food bio&shy;markers.
<p>
Several approaches are used to identify novel
bio&shy;markers of dietary intake. They may involve acute
feeding studies and short- to medium-term dietary
intervention studies in a controlled setting.
These intervention studies focus only on one or a
few specific type(s) of food(s), after which biofluids,
most notably urine or serum, are collected
post&shy;prandially or following the short-to medium term
dietary inter&shy;vention. This approach has been used to
identify several putative bio&shy;markers of specific foods and drinks
such as citrus fruits, cruciferous vegetables, red meat, coffee,
sugar-sweetened beverages, and wine
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="O'Gorman, A., & Brennan, L. (2017). The role of metabolomics in determination of new dietary biomarkers. The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 76(3), 295–302.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28091346/"
target="right" >O'Gorman and Brennan, 2017</a>). </span>
However, the bio&shy;markers identified in this way reveal
no infor&shy;mation on other dietary origins of the
identified bio&shy;markers. In addition, for those bio&shy;markers that
are short-term, and excreted rapidly and
almost completely over 24hr, their usefulness as
bio&shy;markers of habitual intake remains questionable.
<p>
Potential bio&shy;markers for specific foods can
also be identified using cohort studies.
In this approach, metabolic profiles of high or
low consumers of specific food(s), identified by a
self-reported dietary questionnaire are examined.
Studies of this type have identified proline betaine and flavanone
glucuronides as potential bio&shy;markers of citrus fruit
intake

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23425595/"
target="right" >Pujos-Guillot et&nbsp;al., 2013</a>). </span>
 Biomarkers for fish,
red meat, whole-grain bread, and walnuts have also
been identified using this approach
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="O'Gorman, A., & Brennan, L. (2017). The role of metabolomics in determination of new dietary biomarkers. The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 76(3), 295–302.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28091346/"
target="right" >O'Gorman and Brennan, 2017</a>). </span>
Never&shy;the&shy;less, because these studies
only generate associations, validation of the
metabo&shy;lite as a specific bio&shy;marker of intake
should be confirmed through a controlled dietary intervention study.
<p>
Large cross-sectional or cohort studies have also
used dietary patterns to identify multiple bio&shy;markers of
food intake. Dietary patterns can be identified by principal
component analysis or k&#8209;means cluster analysis.
Once identified, the dietary patterns are linked to meta&shy;bolomic
profiles through regression (or other statistical methods) to
identify dietary bio&shy;markers. Using this approach,
meta&shy;bolites have been identified that can be used to
predict compliance to complex diets and to study
relationships between diet and disease

Once identified, the performance of all bio&shy;markers of
dietary exposure must always be validated in an
independent and diverse epidemiological study,
and across different laboratories to establish
whether they are generalizable to free-living popu&shy;lations. This approach was used by Heinzmann et&nbsp;al.
