Figure 15.4. Prospective associations of quintile categories of fatty acid 
biomarkers for dairy fat consumption with the risk of developing T2D. 
Cohort-specific
associations by quintiles were assessed in multivariable models in each cohort 
and pooled with inverse-variance Â± weighted meta-analysis. Cohort-specific 
multivariable
adjustment was made. In the first model (open diamond), estimates were 
adjusted for sex, age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, socioeconomic 
status, physical
activity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and menopausal status for women. 
Then, the estimates were further adjusted for BMI (grey diamond) and further
adjusted for triglycerides and palmitic acid (16:0) as markers of <em>de novo</em> lipogenesis (black diamond). To compute p-values for a trend across quintiles, 
each fatty acid
was evaluated as an ordinal variable in the most adjusted model. T2D, type 2
diabetes mellitus.  Redrawn from Imamura et.&nbsp;al,  PLoS medicine 15(10), e1002670.
