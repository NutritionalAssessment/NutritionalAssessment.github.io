<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

Dietary deficiencies of vitamin&nbsp;B12 in industrialized countries are 
relatively rare and usually arise from food-bound mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion, 
particularly in the elderly. Secondary B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency may also 
develop from certain disease states or medications that interfere with B12 absorption. 
In low or middle-income countries, however, dietary vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency 
may occur among children and pregnant and lactating women who 
exclude or consume low amounts of animal-source foods.  
Absorption of B12 occurs via passive or active absorption, 
the latter a complex process during which the bioavailability of dietary 
B12 in healthy adults is assumed to be about 40&#8209;50%. Dietary requirements 
for B12 vary across countries, with some establishing adequate intakes (AIs) 
but not requirements <i>per se.</i>  There is no Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) 
for vitamin&nbsp;B12 because high intakes have 
not been associated with any adverse health effects.
<p></p>
There are two major meta&shy;bolic roles for vitamin&nbsp;B12: 
(a) synthesis of methionine from homo&shy;cysteine and 
(b) conver&shy;sion of methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A. 
Vitamin&nbsp;B12 has an important role in cellular  meta&shy;bolism, especially in DNA-synthesis, 
methylation and mitochondrial meta&shy;bolism. Deficiency of B12 predominantly 
affects hemato&shy;logical and  neuro&shy;logical systems, although 
neuropsychiatric symptoms are often the first clinical manifestation. 
Notably, the full spectrum of clinical features associated with 
B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency is much broader, is nonspecific, and may occur 
as a consequence of other diseases.
<p></p>
Risk of B12 insufficiency can be assessed through measure&shy;ment of 
dietary vitamin&nbsp;B12 intake, a biomarker of exposure. Currently, no gold standard 
exists to define deficiency of vitamin&nbsp;B12. Total B12 concen&shy;tration in 
serum is most frequently used, despite its poor sensitivity and specificity.  
Conse&shy;quently, a combination of biomarkers is preferred to define and 
classify B12 status. If subclinical vitamin&nbsp;B12 is suspected, 
then circulating total vitamin&nbsp;B12 or trans&shy;cobalamin (TC)-bound B12 (i.e., holo TC) 
in serum should be measured first, followed by 
methyl&shy;malonic acid (MMA) or homo&shy;cysteine in serum, both more sensitive 
functional biomarkers that reflect B12 stores rather than intake. 
Algorithms based on all or some of these biomarkers measured either 
sequentially or concurrently are often applied, with 
concurrent biomarkers combined into a single indicator termed cB12. 
For all B12 biomarkers, information should be collected  on age, 
gender, ethnicity, pregnancy, folate status, and 
presence of possible bacterial over&shy;growth because all these factors 
impact B12 biomarkers. There is no consensus on the interpretive 
criteria used to define inadequate B12 status with these B12 biomarkers. 
For some, statistically defined reference limits are used, 
whereas for others "true" cutoffs" based on a known relationship 
between the B12 biomarker and low body stores, functional impairment, or 
clinical signs of deficiency, are applied.
<p></p>
Often in clinical patients, once B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency is diagnosed, the next step 
is to establish whether mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion is the cause. In the past, 
the Schilling test was used, but is rarely conducted today because 
this test uses radioactive B12. Instead, the CobaSorb test that measures 
change in serum holoTC concen&shy;trations following an oral dose of 
unlabeled B12 can be used. Under devel&shy;op&shy;ment is the <sup>14</sup>C or 
<sup>13</sup>C-labeled absorption test, each of which measures enrichment of <sup>14</sup>C
or <sup>13</sup>C, 
respectively in blood, urine, or stool following oral ingestion of 
microbiologically-produced B12 labeled with <sup>14</sup>Carbon or <sup>13</sup>Carbon.

<h3>22b.1 Introduction</h3>

The term "vitamin&nbsp;B12" is a generic descriptor for all the corrinoids (compounds 
containing the corrin nucleus) that exhibit the biological activity of 
cyano-cobalamin.  The latter was first isolated in the crystal&shy;line form in 1948

Here, a cyano-group is linked to a cobalt nucleus. 
Different forms of cobalamin exist with linkages of methyl, adenosyl or hydroxo 
groups to cobalt, resulting in methyl&shy;cobalamin, adenosyl&shy;cobalamin and 
hydroxo&shy;cobalamin, respectively.

<h3>22b.1.1  Functions of vitamin&nbsp;B12</h3>

There are two naturally occurring cobalamin containing co-enzymes:  
methyl&shy;cobalamin, the main form in plasma, and 5&#8209;deoxy&shy;adenosyl&shy;cobalamin, 
found in the liver, most body tissues, and foods.  In humans, methyl&shy;cobalamin 
functions in the folate-dependent methylation of homo&shy;cysteine to methionine 
<a href="#figure22b.2">(Figure&nbsp;22b.2)</a>	
whereas 5'&#8209;deoxy&shy;adenosyl-cobalamin plays a 
major part in the conver&shy;sion of L&#8209;methyl&shy;malonyl-coenzyme&nbsp;A 
to succinyl-coenzyme&nbsp;A in an 
isomeriz&shy;ation reaction.  The latter is a common pathway for the degradation of 
certain amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids. 
<p></p>
Vitamin&nbsp;B12 also has a link with nucleic acid meta&shy;bolism via its role in 
the conver&shy;sion of 5&#8209;methyl&shy;tetra&shy;hydro&shy;folate to tetra&shy;hydro&shy;folate. 
Conse&shy;quently, a deficiency of vitamin&nbsp;B12, like folate, 
impairs the production of tetra&shy;hydro&shy;folate, which is required for 
thymidine and thus DNA synthesis.  Impaired DNA synthesis is 
responsible for the megalo&shy;blastic bone marrow, a characteristic of 
deficiencies of both vitamin&nbsp;B12 and folic acid.

<h3>22b.1.2  Food sources and dietary intakes </h3>

In nature, vitamin&nbsp;B12 is produced almost entirely by bacterial synthesis.  
Vitamin&nbsp;B12-producing bacteria colonize the large bowel, but humans do 
not have the ability to absorb bacterial vitamin&nbsp;B12 from their large intestine. 
Instead, humans are dependent solely on dietary sources of vitamin&nbsp;B12 
from: (a) methyl- and 5'deoxyadenosyl forms of vitamin&nbsp;B12 present in 
animal-source foods, which reach the small intestine 

<span data-tippy-content="Sobczyńska-Malefora, A., & Smith, A. D. (2022).

or (b) crystal&shy;line B12 
in fortified foods or dietary supple&shy;ments. Plants do not contain 
vitamin&nbsp;B12, except for some dried green and purple seaweeds, 
which have a symbiotic relation with B12 producing bacteria

The richest food sources of vitamin&nbsp;B12 include meat (especially liver, followed by 
kidney and heart), eggs, dairy products, fish and shellfish. 
Several forms of vitamin&nbsp;B12 exist in foods: meat and fish 
contain mainly adenosyl-cobalamin (Ado&#8209;Cbl) and hydroxo&shy;cobalamin (OH&#8209;Cbl).
Organo-cobalamin (OG&#8209;Cbl) is found mostly in milk; and methyl-cobalamin 
(Me&#8209;Cbl), Ado&#8209;Cbl, and OH&#8209;Cbl are found in nearly all dairy products

Vitamin&nbsp;B12 is fairly stable and normally not destroyed by cooking at normal 
temper&shy;atures, although in an alkaline pH some loss may occur.  Bioavailability of 
vitamin&nbsp;B12 from foods is generally assumed to be 40&#8209;50% for healthy adults.  
However, studies assessing bioavailability of B12 from specific food sources 
in healthy participants have shown that absorption varies depending on both 
the specific food product and the magnitude of the dose, ranging from 
36%&#8209;24% for egg products (dose 0.3&#8209;0.94mg, respectively), 
83%&#8209;52% for lean meat (dose 0.54&#8209;5.11mg, respectively), 
42%&#8209;30% for fish (dose 2.1&#8209;13.1mg, respectively) and 49%&#8209;4.5% 
for liver products (dose 0.5&#8209;38mg, respectively)

The uptake of supple&shy;mental (crystal&shy;line) vitamin&nbsp;B12 from 
B12&#8209;fortifed foods and dietary supple&shy;ments occurs by passive diffusion.

<h3>22b.1.3  Absorption and meta&shy;bolism</h3>

For the transport into body cells, vitamin&nbsp;B12 is absorbed by either active 
absorption or passive diffusion. Only 1&#8209;2% of an oral crystal&shy;line dose of 
non-protein bound vitamin&nbsp;B12 &mdash; as occurs in fortified foods and 
supple&shy;ments &mdash; is absorbed by simple passive diffusion throughout 
the length of the gastro&shy;intestinal tract

<p></p>
Active absorption of vitamin&nbsp;B12 is a highly complex active 
transport system, which takes 3&#8209;4h to complete from ingestion by 
mouth to appearance in the circulation.
Essential steps include the release of dietary 
B12 from the food matrix by the activity of hydro&shy;chloric acid and 
gastric protease in the stomach. Here B12 binds to hapto&shy;corrin 
produced by salivary glands. In the upper small intestine 
where the pH changes to less acidic conditions, 
hapto&shy;corrin is degraded by pancreatic proteases, 
releasing B12 which subsequently becomes bound to gastric 
intrinsic factor (IF) to form the IF&#8209;B12 complex. 
Gastric intrinsic factor is a highly specific binding glycoprotein, 
which is synthesized and secreted by the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa.
<p></p> 
Absorption of the IF&#8209;B12 complex mainly takes place through receptor sites 
in the terminal ileum, at an alkaline pH, and in the presence of calcium ions

However, the capacity of IF&#8209;mediated

Once in the blood, free B12 binds to two proteins: transcobalmin, forming  
holo-trans&shy;cobalamin (holoTC), and hapto&shy;corrin to form holo-hapto&shy;corrin (holoHC). 
Of the two, holoTC has a much faster turnover than the holohapto&shy;corrin complex, 
and as a result low TC concen&shy;trations are considered to be the 
earliest indicator of failure to absorb vitamin&nbsp;B12 from food. 
Normally only about 10% of total trans&shy;cobalamin is bound to B12, 
whereas in contrast hapto&shy;corrin carries about 80% of the B12 in the circulation, 
despite having no role in the cellular uptake of vitamin&nbsp;B12

Upon delivery of B12 to the tissues by holo TC, receptor-mediated endo&shy;cytosis occurs, 
after which holoTC enters acidic lysosomes where the trans&shy;cobalamin protein is degraded, 
the B12 is released, and then converted to its cofactor forms

Loss of vitamin&nbsp;B12 takes place via desquamation of epithelium and through 
secretion in the bile.  Most of the vitamin&nbsp;B12 secreted in the bile, 
however, is reabsorbed and is thus available for meta&shy;bolic functions. 
Losses of B12 in adults approximate 1&#8209;3&micro;g/d (about 0.1% of body stores). 
However, because excretion of vitamin&nbsp;B12 in the stool is proportional to B12 
body stores, B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency develops more slowly in persons han in persons 
with no intrinsic factor or with malabsorption

<h3>22b.1.4  Deficiency of vitamin&nbsp;B12 in humans</h3>

The common consequence of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency is a cellular deficit in one of the 
coenzyme forms of B12 which affects cellular meta&shy;bolism, methylation and 
mitochondrial meta&shy;bolism: such deficits may pass from a stage of subclinical 
deficiency through to severe, clinical forms. The clinical signs of vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency 
occur in the hemato&shy;poietic, gastro&shy;intestinal, and neuro&shy;logical systems

The hemato&shy;logical effects of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency are indistinguishable 
from those of folate deficiency and include megalo&shy;blastic anemia, 
accompanied by the classical anemia 
symptoms of diminished energy and tolerance to exercise, fatigue, shortness of 
breath, and palpitations.  The megalo&shy;blastic changes result from an interference 
with normal DNA synthesis, arising from lack of 5,10&#8209;methylene 
tetrahydrofolate, as described for folate deficiency. 
<p></p>
Gastrointestinal effects of vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency include atrophic glossitis, 
papillary atrophy of the tongue, loss of appetite, flatulence, and constipation.

The neuro&shy;logical complications progress gradually and are variable.  
They may recede or occur in the absence of anemia

Interest in the possible association of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency with Alzheimer’s disease, 
vascular dementia, and other neuro&shy;logical disorders has increased with the 
recognition that homo&shy;cysteine can be a biomarker for B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency. 
In elderly persons, for example,  serum total homo&shy;cysteine concen&shy;tration 
is often elevated in those whose folate status is normal but 
who have a clinical response to B12 treatment 

<span data-tippy-content="Stabler, S. P., Lindenbaum, J., & Allen, R. H. (1996).

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8642468"
target="right" >Stabler et al., 1996</a>). </span>

Moreover, in several reports cognitive decline and brain atrophy has 
been slowed by lowering plasma total homo&shy;cysteine concen&shy;trations with 
B&nbsp;vitamins including B12 

<span data-tippy-content="Smith, A. D., Refsum, H., Bottiglieri, T., Fenech, M.,

These findings have led to the consensus that elevated plasma 
total homo&shy;cysteine is a modifiable risk factor for devel&shy;op&shy;ment of 
cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer’s 
disease in older persons. Convincing arguments also exist for 
the role of homo&shy;cysteine as a biomarker for cardio&shy;vascular disease 
and the utility of B vitamins and folate as a treatment.  
According to Smith and Refsum 

<span data-tippy-content="Smith, A. D., & Refsum, H. (2021). Homo&shy;cysteine &mdash; from 
disease biomarker to disease prevention. Journal of internal medicine, 290(4), 826&#8209;854.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660358"
target="right" >2021</a>), </span>

homo&shy;cysteine values of 10&micro;mol/L 
are probably safe in adults but for levels 11&micro;mol/L or 
above there may be a risk for adverse effects, justifying intervention. 
More research is warranted.

In most industrialized countries, clinical B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency is relatively rare, 
with many of the causes being of ileal or gastric origin

Pernicious anemia (affecting 0.1% of the general population, 
and up to 2&#8209;4% of adults over the age of 60y) or 
mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion associated with a variety of other conditions are 
usually the cause of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency

Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune gastritis with a genetic 
component that destroys the gastric mucosa. Conse&shy;quently, 
with the lack of gastric intrinsic factor, IF&#8209;mediated active 
absorption in the ileum is compromised.  
Pernicious anemia can also be caused by long-term gastric 
atrophy or atrophic gastritis which result in loss of gastric acid. 
The latter hinders the release of B12 from food and can also cause 
bacterial over&shy;growth with competition for the vitamin

A variety of other disease states may result in the mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion of B12 and thus, 
secondary vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency.  For example, in patients 
who have had a total gastrectomy mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion of vitamin&nbsp;B12 
occurs through a lack of intrinsic factor. Megaloblastic anemia in these patients 
may not appear until a long period after the total gastrectomy (5&#8209;10 y), 
because of the capacity of the body to reutilize the vitamin. 
In persons with intestinal lesions such as jejunal diverticulosis or 
some anatomical abnormalities with bacterial over&shy;growth (e.g., fistulas and blind-loops), 
vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency may develop because bacteria in the colon competitively 
utilize all the available vitamin&nbsp;B12

The fish tape worm (Diphyllobothrium latum) also sequesters vitamin&nbsp;B12 and 
in the past was a well-recognized cause of vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency in Finland. 
Patients with either tropical or nontropical (gluten-sensitive) sprue and 
regional ileitis may also develop vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency, 
because of alterations in the brush border structure of the ileal mucosa, 
which contains the receptor for intrinsic factor.  The deficiency may also 
occur in pancreatic insufficiency due to an inability to digest protein-bound vitamin&nbsp;B12.

Some drugs, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine 2 receptor 
antagonists (H2RAs) are acid-inhibiting, impairing the release of dietary B12

Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) is commonly used for sedation and pain relief, but it is also 
subject to abuse. The gas chemically inactivates B12 through irreversible 
oxidation of its coenzyme form, methyl&shy;cobalamin, at the active site of the 
B12&#8209;dependent methionine synthase reaction. Depending on the frequency and 
duration of exposure and the vitamin&nbsp;B12 status of the individual, 
B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency may develop quickly or more slowly

<h3>22b.1.5  Recom&shy;mended intakes of vitamin&nbsp;B12</h3>

When setting recom&shy;mended dietary reference values, expert groups assume the 
bioavailability of B12 from the diet is about 50% for healthy adults with 
normal absorption, even though the absorption from specific foods varies 
markedly as noted earlier.  Absorption of crystal&shy;line B12 from 
fortified foods and dietary supple&shy;ments is higher ranging from 55 to 74%, 
and unaffected by food-bound mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion. 
<p></p>
Currently there is some debate about whether the current B12 recom&shy;mendations 
are sufficient to achieve optimum vitamin&nbsp;B12 status

In the United States and Canada, Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) 
were set to maintain hemato&shy;logical values of serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 within the normal range, 
whereas the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded there was 
insufficient available data to set DRIs 

<span data-tippy-content="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for

target="right" >EFSA, 2015</a>). </span>

Instead, EFSA used a combination of B12 biomarkers and European adult 
mean B12 intakes to estimate Adequate Intakes (AIs) for 
all life-stage and physio&shy;logical groups. 
<p></p>
In the United States and Canada, the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for 
both males and females aged 19 >70y is 2&micro;g/day. The EAR represents the level of 
vitamin&nbsp;B12 that is estimated to meet the B12 requirements of 50% of the 
healthy individuals in a particular sex and life-stage group. 
The corre&shy;sponding Recom&shy;mended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for these adults is 2.4&micro;g/day 
(assuming a CV of 10%), a level designed to cover the needs of 97 to 98 percent of 
individuals in the group. However, because of the high prevalence of 
food-bound mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion among older adults, those >50 years are encouraged to consume 
B12 fortified foods (such as fortified ready-to-eat cereals) or 
supple&shy;ments to ensure they meet their B12 needs. For details of the DRIs for 
other life-stage groups, see IOM

<h2>22b.2 Biomarkers of vitamin&nbsp;B12 status</h2>

Biomarkers of vitamin&nbsp;B12 status have been reviewed by the expert international 
panel as part of the Biomarkers of Nutrition for Devel&shy;op&shy;ment (BOND) project; 
see Allen et al 

<span data-tippy-content="Allen, L. H., Miller, J. W., de Groot, L., Rosenberg, I. H., 
Smith, A. D., Refsum, H., & Raiten, D. J. (2018). Biomarkers of Nutrition for Devel&shy;op&shy;ment (BOND):

for more details. Risk of B12 insufficiency 
can be assessed through the measure&shy;ment of dietary intake of vitamin&nbsp;B12, 
a biomarker of exposure. Quantitative dietary assessment methods 
such as 24h recalls and food records must be used; for more details see 
Chapter&nbsp;3:  Measure&shy;ment of food con&shy;sump&shy;tion of individuals. 
The variation in day-to-day intake of vitamin&nbsp;B12 is often 
large when vitamin&nbsp;B12&#8209;rich foods such as liver are consumed, 
so multiple days of intake should be recorded on each individual 
and the observed distribution of intakes adjusted to yield usual 
intake distribution. This is achieved by removing the variability 
introduced by the day-to-day variation in B12 intakes within an individual. 
In this way, the proportion of individuals in a population group at risk of 
B12 insufficiency can be determined. Details of the adjustment process are given in Chapter&nbsp;3.
<p></p>
In population groups consuming crystal&shy;line B12 in fortified foods and in supple&shy;ments, 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion is often intermittent necessitating several days of intake or 
use of a food frequency questionnaire. Details of the B12 
content of many dietary supple&shy;ments are available in the U.S. federal Dietary 
Supple&shy;ment Ingredient Database. No correction is made for differences 
in the bioavailability of crystal&shy;line B12 from supple&shy;ments or fortified foods 
compared with B12 from food because the absorption differences 
between these two B12 sources are assumed to be small. 
<p></p>
Alternatively, instead of determining quantitative B12 intakes, 
estimates of the usual con&shy;sump&shy;tion of animal products per day, week, or 
month can be used to assess risk of inadequate intakes of B12 for individuals 
in households and for population groups; see Chapter&nbsp;3 for more details.  
Several studies have reported significant positive associations 
between animal source food intake and vitamin&nbsp;B12 status 

<span data-tippy-content="McLean, E. D., Allen, L. H., Neumann, C. G.,

<p></p>
A combination of biochemical biomarkers is recom&shy;mended to assess 
actual B12 status, together with knowledge of factors such as age, gender, 
pregnancy, folate status, and bacterial over&shy;growth, all known to 
impact some of the B12 biochemical biomarkers. The four priority 
bio&shy;chem&shy;ical biomarkers recom&shy;mended by the Biomarkers of Nutrition for 
Devel&shy;op&shy;ment (BOND) project to detect subclinical vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency 
are total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12, serum holotrans&shy;cobalamin (holo TC), 
plasma homo&shy;cysteine, and serum methyl&shy;malonic acid; see

for more details. Biochemical assays for each of these biomarkers 
together with the recom&shy;mended tests  to determine the cause of 
the vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency are outlined below.  
<p></p>
The BOND project caution that currently no gold standard exists to define 
vitamin&nbsp;B12&#8209;deficiency using these biochemical biomarkers.  If subclinical 
vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency is suspected, then total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 or serum 
holoTC is frequently measured first, followed by methyl&shy;malonic acid (MMA) or 
plasma homo&shy;cysteine (tHcy) concen&shy;trations. 

<h3>22b.2.1 Serum vitamin&nbsp;B12</h3>

Of the vitamin&nbsp;B12 in the serum, 20&#8209;30% is attached to the transport protein 
trans&shy;cobalamin (previously known as trans&shy;cobalamin II), and the 
remaining 70&#8209;80% is bound and carried by hapto&shy;corrin, the latter 
historically designated as trans&shy;cobalamin I and trans&shy;cobalamin III. 
Hence, total plasma or serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;tration includes B12 
(cobalamin) bound to trans&shy;cobalamin (holoTC) and B12 bound to hapto&shy;corrin. 
Assessment of total B12 in plasma or serum provides information on intake of B12,  
long-term B12 status of the individual, and liver stores.
<p></p>
Of these two circulating transport proteins, only trans&shy;cobalamin bound to B12 to form 
holotrans&shy;cobalamin (holoTC) in serum is meta&shy;bolically active, delivering 
vitamin&nbsp;B12 to receptors on cell membranes. In contrast, because there are no 
hapto&shy;corrin receptors located on most cells, B12 cannot be delivered 
to extrahepatic tissues by hapto&shy;corrin. Moreover, hapto&shy;corrin 
binds not only B12 but also B12&nbsp;analogs. However, 
because gastric intrinsic factor does not bind 
the B12 analogs (only B12), the B12&nbsp;analogs are not 
reabsorbed but ultimately excreted in the stool

<p></p>
In early vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency, when individuals are in negative balance, the 
amount of vitamin&nbsp;B12 attached to holoTC falls, but there is no concomitant 
decline in the total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations.  The latter often remain 
normal for weeks or months despite low serum holoTC levels.  Serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 
concen&shy;trations only decline when the percentage saturation of total trans&shy;cobalamin  
with vitamin&nbsp;B12 falls below 5%

<p></p>
Total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations are expressed aspmol/L, or aspg/mL in 
clinical practice with 1.0pg/mL=0.7378pmol/L.  Concen&shy;trations above the normal 
level of 221pmol/L are indicative of an adequate B12 status, whereas those 
between 150 and 221pmol/L, or often below 150pmol/L, are indicative of B12 depletion or deficiency, 
respectively. 
<p></p>
Traditionally, total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 is often the first-line biochemical test 
used for routine screening for vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency; concen&shy;trations reflect 
both the vitamin&nbsp;B12 intake

and body stores. However, to date a single accepted cut&#8209;value for serum&nbsp;B12 indicative of deficiency 
has not been established.  Moreover, the serum&nbsp;B12 test has low sensitivity and 
specificity and may overestimate B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency when used alone

For example, clinical cases of vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency have been reported even in 
persons with low-to-normal total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 levels

The latter may be explained by the presence of a physio&shy;logically inactive proportion of 
serum&nbsp;B12 being bound to the carrier protein hapto&shy;corrin, as explained earlier.  
Many, but not all of these cases, have shown a positive response to treatment with 
vitamin&nbsp;B12, based on improvements in abnormal metabolite levels and clinical indices

Most available prevalence data on B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency based on total serum&nbsp;B12 
concen&shy;trations are focussed on older adults. In reports based on 48 cohorts, 
10&#8209;19% of adults more than 60 years of age had total serum&nbsp;B12 levels below 
148 or 150pmol/l and said to be indicative of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency.  A 
high prevalence of low serum / plasma&nbsp;B12 has also been reported 
among pregnant women (27.5% in 11 cohorts) and children 
(12.5% in 14 cohorts)

<h4>Factors affecting total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 </h4>

<b>Age</b> influences levels of total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12. Infants and children 
have higher serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations compared with adults, irrespective of ethnicity, 
perhaps in part attributed to their higher intake of milk in early childhood and a 
more efficient hepatic storage of B12

<b>Pregnancy</b> can lead to a 25&#8209;30% fall in total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations 
between 20&#8209; and 30&#8209;weeks of gestation. The decline is due to decreased synthesis of  
hapto&shy;corrin and hemodilution. Holotrans&shy;cobalamin (holoTC) concen&shy;trations, 
however, remain unchanged during pregnancy so the decline is unlikely to reflect 
B12 depletion. Indeed, by 14 weeks postpartum, total serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations are no

<b>Lactation</b> is accompanied by a 40% increase in serum&nbsp;B12 at 6 weeks post-partum, 
remaining at this elevated level while the mother is lactating. 
A corre&shy;sponding moderate increase in the functional meta&shy;bolic biomarkers &mdash; plasma 
methymalonic acid and homo&shy;cysteine &mdash; suggests that some depletion of maternal 
intracellular vitamin&nbsp;B12 has occurred even though serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations are high

<b>Ethnicity</b> affects serum/plasma&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations. People of African origin have

This ethnic difference 
is attributed in part to a higher concen&shy;tration of B12 binding proteins, most 
notably the transport protein hapto&shy;corrin.  However, because B12 bound to 
hapto&shy;corrin is not meta&shy;bolically active, use of only total serum&nbsp;B12 may result in 
Black patients being incorrectly identified as having a high B12 status. Clearly, 
failure to apply ethnic-related serum&nbsp;B12 reference intervals will lead to 
under&shy;diagnosis of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency and any associated comorbidities

<b>Folate status</b>, both deficiency and excess, might affect total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 
levels. Folate deficiency may result in moderately low total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 
concen&shy;trations because both folate as a cosubstrate (methyl donor) and vitamin&nbsp;B12 
(as a coenzyme) are required in the remeth&shy;yl&shy;ation meta&shy;bolic pathway 
of homo&shy;cysteine (see Figure 22b.2)

The mechanism for the interaction between excess folate and B12 is uncertain and 
warrants further investigation. One proposed hypothesis, as yet untested, 
is that high-dose folic acid supple&shy;ments cause depletion of the transport protein 
holotrans&shy;cobalamin in serum, thus exacerbating B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency. 
Older adults with both low total serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations and increased levels 
of serum folate appear to have a higher risk of anemia and dementia, 
based on a review of the clinical and epidemiological evidence. 
The high serum folate levels are presumed to arise from exposure to 
high intakes of folic acid, the synthetic form of folate used in fortified foods 
and supple&shy;ments

<b>Bacterial over&shy;growth</b> of the small intestine may lead to low serum&nbsp;B12 
concen&shy;trations and vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency because the bacteria utilize vitamin&nbsp;B12 
for their own meta&shy;bolism so B12 cannot be absorbed by the body.  
<p></p>
<b>Fish tapeworm</b> also leads to B12 mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion because the tapeworms 
consume B12 for their own needs, so serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations fall.

<b>Chronic infection with <i>Helicobacter pylori,</i></b> often accompanied by intestinal

<b>Lack of gastric intrinsic factor</b> caused by pernicious anemia or gastrectomy leads to low 
total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations.  Intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein synthesized 
by the gastric parietal cells, is required for the absorption of vitamin&nbsp;B12 in the 
small intestine.  In some cases of pernicious anemia, parietal cell auto-antibodies 
lead to the destruction of IF&#8209;producing parietal cells in the stomach resulting in 
B12 mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion, and thus deficiency.  The incidence of pernicious anemia increases 
with age, and is especially common among persons of European or African 
descent

<b>Some disease states</b> are associated with low total serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 
concen&shy;trations because of an inability to absorb or digest protein-bound vitamin&nbsp;B12. 
Disease states associated with B12 mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion due to villous atrophy or 
mucosal impairment include ileal Crohn’s or Celiac disease, 
respectively.  In disease states such as atrophic gastritis 
and pancreatic insufficiency, low serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations arise because 
digestion of protein-bound B12 is compromised. Other 
intestinal diseases such as tropical sprue, intestinal lymphoma, amyloidosis, 
and short bowel syndrome have also been associated with low serum&nbsp;B12 levels and B12 depletion.  
<p></p>
<b>Surgery</b> involving partial or complete removal of any part of the

<b>Inborn errors</b> of intracellular B12 meta&shy;bolism can result in low total 
serum&nbsp;B12 levels through their effects on absorption, transport, or meta&shy;bolism of B12. 
The genetic  defects range from rare gene deletion and mutations to 
single nucleotide polymorphisms with more mild and subtle effects. 
In congenital pernicious anemia, low serum total B12 concen&shy;trations 
arise from B12 mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion caused by mutations in a gene (GIF,CBLIF) 
and defects in the synthesis of intrinsic factor.

is important to separate the blood samples
and freeze the serum as soon as possible after collection.

<b>Analytical method</b> may affect the reported serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations.  
Some of the nonfunctional analogs of vitamin&nbsp;B12, as well as the cobalamins, 
were measured in earlier radio-assays.  This led to overestimates of actual 
serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations.  This problem has now been overcome by 
using purified intrinsic factor which does not react with vitamin&nbsp;B12 analogs 
as the binder in the immune-enzymatic assays

However, in patients with pernicious anaemia these assays should not be used 
because the intrinsic factor antibodies in the patient's serum interferes with the 
binding of B12 to the intrinsic factor used in the assay, generating spurious results.  
<p></p>
For the analytical platform used it is essential to adopt reference ranges that 
are compatible with the chosen platform

A standard reference material for serum&nbsp;B12 has been developed by

This SRM consists of three sera with differing vitamin&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations: 
100pg/mL; 200pg/mL; 450pg/mL. 

<h4>Interpretive criteria</h4>

Interpretation of serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations deemed as adequate or inadequate is challenging. 
The normal levels for serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations in healthy persons are 
affected by many factors unrelated to vitamin&nbsp;B12 status, some of which are 
not considered when interpreting the results. These factors may include 
age, ethnicity, pregnancy, use of certain medications, individual genetic variation, 
the assay method and any measure&shy;ment errors associated with its use. All these factors may 
affect the sensitivity and specificity of serum&nbsp;B12 as a biomarker of B12 status and  
result in false-positive or false-negative classification of vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency.
<p></p>
Traditionally, adequate concentrations of biomarkers such as serum&nbsp;B12 are defined 
by a reference interval which covers 95% of the results obtained 
in a healthy, non-diseased population. In practice, however, it is difficult to 
compile a “true” healthy reference and few exist for serum&nbsp;B12.
<p></p>
Two methods are used to define whether a biomarker is deemed “inadequate”, 
both of which have been employed for serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations. 
In some studies, a serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;tration is considered inadequate when it 
falls below a statistically defined lower reference limit, often based on the 
2.5th percentile value from an “apparently healthy” reference distribution 
compiled within a country. Hence, values for serum&nbsp;B12 that represent the 2.5th 
percentile will vary, depending on the local reference distribution applied.
<p></p>
Alternatively, the diagnostic criteria used to identify inadequate B12 status have 
been based on a known relationship between the serum&nbsp;B12 biomarker and low body stores, 
functional impairment, or clinical signs of deficiency. In such cases, the term “cutoff” 
should be used. In practice, the term “cutoff” is often used when the value for 
inadequate B12 has been based on a statistically defined reference limit. 
Again, cutoffs for serum&nbsp;B12 designated in this way can also vary, depending on 
both the local conditions and adverse outcome applied. Frequently, 
the cutoffs for serum&nbsp;B12 indicative of inadequacy have been set based on the 
relationship between serum&nbsp;B12 and serum methyl&shy;malonic acid. 
The latter is a functional biomarker considered to be relatively specific and 
sensitive biomarker of B12 status. For more discussion on the Evaluation of 
nutritional assessment indices, see Chapter&nbsp;1: Introduction Section&nbsp;1.6.
<p></p>
Clearly, the reference limit or cutoff applied to designate inadequate 
vitamin&nbsp;B12 status may vary, leading to differences in the literature on 
reports for the prevalence estimates for vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency. 
Reports on the various methods used to interpret serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations as 
adequate or inadequate are outlined below.

have proposed age-specific 
5th and 95th percentile reference ranges for serum&nbsp;B12 based on data from a 
representative sample of British children aged 4 to 18y from the 
National Diet and Nutritional Survey. Serum B12 concen&shy;trations decreased 
significantly with age, with values for those consuming fortified breakfast 
cereals being significantly higher than non-consumers, a trend that was independent of 
age and gender.  Up to aged 14 years, the 5th and 95th percentiles of 
serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations were 242&#8209;749pmol/L for 
children aged 4&#8209;10 years (n = 317) and 172&#8209;641pmol/L for children 
aged 10&#8209;14 years (n = 263). For children from aged 15&#8209;18 years, sex specific 
5th and 95th percentiles were compiled. These values were 139&#8209;452pmol/L for 
boys (n = 113) and 108&#8209;502pmol/L for girls (n = 132)

Total plasma&nbsp;B12 was measured with an auto&shy;mated competitive chemi&shy;lum&shy;inescent 
immuno&shy;assay. The highest plasma&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations were found in infants, with 
levels gradually decreasing with age. A reference interval of 200&#8209;600pmol/L was 
established for all adults, with a lower plasma&nbsp;B12 reference limit of 200pmol/L, 
irrespective of age. The authors emphasize that when plasma&nbsp;B12 is used alone to 
screen for B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency in surveys which include children and adolescents,
then age-dependent reference limits should be applied.

Dietary habits alone do not appear to explain these ethnic differences. 
Instead, higher concen&shy;trations of B12 binding proteins, most notably hapto&shy;corrin, 
coupled with higher B12&#8209;binding capacities in persons of Black ethnic origin, 
may be responsible for the higher serum&nbsp;B12 levels observed in Black persons

vitamin&nbsp;B12 for a UK population. Unlike the traditional approach whereby 
data are obtained from individuals deemed “healthy”, these investigators 
applied an indirect method designed to overcome the ethical and resourcing 
difficulties experienced when sampling apparently healthy individuals.  
They accessed large datasets of laboratory results from an ethnically 
diverse South-east London patient population attending primary care clinics. 
All laboratories used an auto&shy;mated Chemiluminescent Microparticle Assay (CMIS)

four age groups from birth to 13y. For children from age 14y and adults,

In this study, the lower reference limits for serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations chosen to 
designate B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency for Black and Asian White people 
aged >13 years were: 166pmol/L and 134pmol/L, respectively. 
The authors acknowledge that these reference limits require 
validation using functional B12 biomarkers such as 
serum methyl&shy;malonic acid and homo&shy;cysteine.
<p></p>
As expected, the Black population had higher serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations 
than the White population. However, surprisingly there were no differences 
in serum&nbsp;B12 levels between Asian and White individuals for most age groups 
in these UK adults. This finding may be associated with the treatment practice 
in the UK of recom&shy;mending B12 supple&shy;ments for Asians; lower serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations 
in Asians compared to other ethnicities have been reported elsewhere

Children in all ethnic groups 
also had higher serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations compared with adults, perhaps in part 
attributed to their higher intake of milk in early childhood and a more efficient 
hepatic storage of B12. Clearly, use of these age&#8209; and ethnicity-related reference 
intervals will assist in preventing under reporting of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency in both children 
and the Black population in the UK.

The BOND project has set cutoffs for serum&nbsp;B12 based on the relationship between 
serum&nbsp;B12 and serum methyl&shy;malonic acid, the latter a relatively specific and sensitive 
functional biomarker of B12 status (Section&nbsp;22b.2.4). Recognising the importance of 
establishing normal levels for serum&nbsp;B12 during infancy and early childhood, the 
BOND group provide tentative age-specific ranges for adequacy from birth up to age 
24 months based on data from healthy breastfeeding Norwegian infants and children.

For adults, a single cutoff for adequacy represented by the upper limit (i.e., >221pmol/L) 
of the range said to be indicative of B12 depletion (i.e., 150&#8209;221pmol/L) is also presented. 
In addition, the BOND group also present two serum&nbsp;B12 cutoffs  said to be 
indicative of severe (&lt;75pmol/L) and very severe (75&#8209;&lt;150pmol/L) B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency. 
<p></p>
Clearly, although serum&nbsp;B12 is the most frequently used biomarker of B12 status, 
the  marked variation in the literature for the reference limits and cutoffs 
said to be indicative of inadequate B12 status, make the diagnosis of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency 
and the provision of prevalence estimates based on serum&nbsp;B12 alone challenging. 
For example, depending on the assay, serum&nbsp;B12 cutoffs for deficiency for adults 
may range from 120 to 180pmol/L, with 148pmol/L based on 3&#8209;SDs from the mean of 
an adult reference range, said to be the most common cutoff for frank deficiency

<p></p>
Moderately low serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations between 148 or 150 and 221pmol/L or 
260pmol/L are often considered indicative of depleted or subclinical B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency. 
Subclinical mild B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency is much more common and generally asymptomatic with no 
hemato&shy;logical or neuro&shy;logical manifestations

Even with very low serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations (i.e., below 75pmol/L), 
clinically diagnosable symptoms of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency are said to be apparent in 
only about 50% of people

<p></p>
Even with total serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations considered to be within the normal range, 
neuro&shy;logical or in some cases hemato&shy;logical symptoms related to B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency 
have been reported. This discrepancy may arise in part because the majority
of B12 in serum is bound to the transport protein hapto&shy;corrin which is not 
physio&shy;logically active and thus unavailable for B12-dependent enzymatic reactions in cells

In addition, factors unrelated to vitamin&nbsp;B12 status, 
and noted earlier, may have contributed to the seemingly normal or sometimes high 
levels of serum&nbsp;B12.

In an effort to resolve the discrepancies in the serum&nbsp;B12 cutoffs indicative of  
inadequacy, Bailey et al.

used statistical modeling to identify a single 
change point at which the relation between plasma methyl&shy;malonic acid and serum&nbsp;B12 
changes slope to differentiate between inadequate and adequate B12 status. However,  
Instead of a single change point, they reported three slopes resulting in two 
change points and three subgroups. The data used were from the earlier 
US NHANES 1999&#8209;2004 surveys. The first group considered at high risk for 
severe B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency had serum&nbsp;B12 &lt;126pmol/L and the highest plasma 
methyl&shy;malonic acid (281nmol/L). The second group deemed likely to have 
adequate B12 status had a serum&nbsp;B12 >287pmol/L and a median methyl&shy;malonic 
acid concen&shy;tration of 120nmol/L, while the third group was classified as 
indeterminate and difficult to interpret with an intermediate serum&nbsp;B12 (126&#8209;287pmol/L).  
<p></p>
Clearly, more research is warranted to establish appropriate cut&#8209;offs for 
interpreting serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations. In response to the concerns noted 
above that reduce the sensitivity and specificity of serum&nbsp;B12 and confound 
the diagnosis of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency, many investigators now recom&shy;mend measuring 
one functional B12 biomarker (serum methyl&shy;malonic acid or serum homo&shy;cysteine) 
if serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations appear inadequate to ensure a more accurate 
assessment of B12 status. These additional tests are more sensitive and 
specific biomarkers of functional B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency and both may be elevated 
in persons with serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 levels even in the low to normal 
range (100&#8209;300pmol/L)

<h4>Measure&shy;ment of serum vitamin&nbsp;B12</h4>

Initially serum&nbsp;B12 was measured by microbiological methods, 
using bacteria with relatively specific requirements for vitamin&nbsp;B12 for growth. 
Examples include both <i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis</i> (ATCC 4797), 
also known as <i>L. leichmannii,</i> or <i>Euglena gracilis</i>

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6387014"

The microbiological assay has several limitations.  For example, bacteriostatic 
substances in the blood, including antibiotics or cancer chemotherapeutic 
agents, inhibit the growth of the microorganism and interfere with the assay, 
producing misleadingly low serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations. The main disadvantage 
of the microbiological method, however, is its low specificity as it 
measures a variety of cobalamin analogs that are not necessarily biologically active

<p></p>
Competitive-binding assays that use radioisotope dilution methods for detection 
are simpler and less time consuming than the microbiological assays. 
Many of the available competitive-binding assays methods have been auto&shy;mated

and unlike the microbiological assays, they are not affected by 
antibiotics or cancer chemotherapeutic agents.  The coefficient of variation among the six 
laboratories for serum vitamin&nbsp;B12 analyzed by auto&shy;mated competitive-binding assays 
has been reported to vary from 4.4% to 10.0%

However, the method requires 
the addition of radioactive cyanocobalamin to compete with vitamin&nbsp;B12 in the serum for 
the binding sites on an added cobalamin-binding protein.  Purified hog intrinsic 
factor is now often used as the binding protein.  Alkaline conditions are used to 
disrupt the vitamin&nbsp;B12 from the binding proteins, after which the vitamin&nbsp;B12 is 
generally converted to cyanocobalamin by potassium cyanide, prior to measure&shy;ment

However, the assay is falling into disuse with possible 
discontinuation of the kits

<p></p>
More recently, clinical laboratories are using high throughput 
auto&shy;mated competitive binding chemiluminescence assays (CBLA), using purified 
intrinsic factor as a reagent to measure total vitamin&nbsp;B12 after its release 
from endogenous binding proteins. For this method both samples and comparators 
should be protected from light during collection and separation. Caution should 
be observed when this method is used to interpret results in patients with 
pernicious anemia. In these patients some of the competitive binding 
chemiluminescence assays can be influenced by the presence of interfering 
anti&#8209;IF antibodies, thereby providing spuriously elevated serum cobalamin 
concen&shy;trations, as noted earlier.
<p></p>
Serum B12 can also be determined using B12&#8209;antibodies and B12 enzyme-linked 
immuno&shy;sorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Various kits are available. Although these 
could potentially provide an alternative to IF&#8209;based assays, they have not been 
completely verified

<p></p>
Both serum and plasma samples in which EDTA has been used as
the anticoagulant can be used for all the B12 analytical methods. 
However, use of lithium heparin should be avoided, as this anticoagulant 
may produce gelatinous serum and elevated B12 concen&shy;trations.  
Blood samples for analysis of serum&nbsp;B12 should be protected from 
light during collection, and whole blood separated as soon as possible 
as delays in centrifugation and separation can lead to an initial rise 
in serum&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations

<h3>22b.2.2 Serum holotrans&shy;cobalamin </h3>

Serum holotrans&shy;cobalamin (holoTC) is the physio&shy;logically active metabolite of 
vitamin&nbsp;B12 that delivers the vitamin to all DNA synthesizing cells, as discussed 
earlier. Only 20&#8209;30% of the total vitamin&nbsp;B12 in serum is bound to the trans&shy;cobalamin 
protein. Holo&#8209;TC accounts for 5&#8209;20% of total trans&shy;cobalamin which is made in the ileal 
entero&shy;cytes from intra&shy;cellularly synthesized trans&shy;cobalamin and absorbed vitamin&nbsp;B12. 
<p></p>
Serum holoTC, like serum&nbsp;B12, reflects a broad range of intakes and status 

<span data-tippy-content="Yetley, E. A., Pfeiffer, C. M., Phinney, K. W., 
Bailey, R. L., Blackmore, S., Bock, J. L., Brody, L. C., Carmel, R., Curtin, L. R.,

but is more sensitive and specific than serum&nbsp;B12.  
For example, because holoTC has a short half-life, concen&shy;trations quickly 
fall below normal after vitamin&nbsp;B12 absorption ceases.  Hence, low holoTC 
concen&shy;trations in serum are often considered the earliest indicator of 
negative vitamin&nbsp;B12 balance. With increasing intakes of vitamin&nbsp;B12, 
concen&shy;trations of holoTC rise continuously at least until vitamin&nbsp;B12 
saturates the transport proteins.  The holoTC assay is unaffected by 
interference from high-titre intrinsic factor antibody levels. Moreover, 
serum holoTC is not subject to the 25&#8209;30% fall in pregnancy that is 
bserved with serum&nbsp;B12. At postpartum, serum&nbsp;B12 rises substantially.  
Instead, serum holoTC increases during pregnancy, a trend  
that continues to 6 weeks post-partum. Thus, in pregnancy serum holoTC 
offers a diagnostic advantage over total serum&nbsp;B12

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29947806"
target="right" >Varsi et al., 2018</a>). </span>

Serum holoTC is also a useful test for identifying patients who may suffer 
from suspected deficiencies in the two vitamin&nbsp;B12 binding proteins, trans&shy;cobalamin 
and hapto&shy;corrin.
<p></p>
Serum holoTC is  a component of the CobaSorb test now used as a surrogate 
for the dual isotope Schilling test

target="right" >Nexo & Hoffman-Lucke, 2011</a>) </span>

(see Section&nbsp;22b.2.7).  
In the past the Schilling test was the gold standard method to evaluate the functional 
capacity of the ileal IF&#8209;B12 receptor and required the use of cobalt-labeled B12. 
However, the Schilling test is no longer available worldwide due to safety factors 
related to use of radioactive B12 and is now considered obsolete. 

<h4>Factors affecting serum holotrans&shy;cobalamin</h4>

<b>Age, sex, and race</b> and their effects on serum holoTC concen&shy;trations 
appear limited. Only a few reports are available with inconsistent results 

<span data-tippy-content="Nexo, E., & Hoffmann-Lücke, E. (2011). Holotrans&shy;cobalamin, 
a marker of vitamin&nbsp;B12 status: analytical aspects and clinical utility.

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21593496"
target="right" >Nexo & Hoffman-Lucke, 2011</a>). </span>

Hence, currently data are insufficient to take 
into account the slight differences in serum holoTC concen&shy;trations by age, 
sex, and possibly race for adults. 
<p></p>
<b>Pregnancy</b> does not affect serum holoTC, levels increasing 
from 18&nbsp;weeks gestation to 6&nbsp;weeks postpartum. This trend contrasts with 
the decline in serum&nbsp;B12 observed during pregnancy 

<span data-tippy-content="Varsi, K., Ueland, P. M., Torsvik, I. K., & 
Bjørke-Monsen, A. L. (2018). Maternal Serum Cobalamin at 18 Weeks of Pregnancy

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29947806"
target="right" >Varsi et al., 2018</a>). </span>

The latter results from a decrease in the synthesis of hapto&shy;corrin and possibly 
hemodilution. Conse&shy;quently, assay of serum holoTC rather than serum&nbsp;B12 is preferable 
in studies of pregnant women.
<p></p>
<b>Inherited</b> defects such as trans&shy;cobalamin deficiency is associated with 
unmeasurable levels of holoTC in serum. This genetic defect is associated 
with severe B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency because lack of the trancobalamin protein 
prevents B12 binding and formation of holoTC. Early treatment, however, 
can lead to a good clinical outcome.  
<p></p> 
Presence of the rare minor allele re35838&#8209;82 (p.R215W) in the trans&shy;cobalamin 
gene is also associated with unmeasurable levels of holoTC in serum. 
In this defect, there is  proportionately more B12  bound to serum hapto&shy;corrin, 
the physio&shy;logically inactive B12 transport protein. This genetic defect is more 
common in South Asians and those of African origin, and unlike transcobalmin deficiency, 
is associated with other B12 biomarkers in the normal range and no clinical symptoms. 
 <p></p>
Transcobalamin receptor (TCblR/CD320) polymorphisms may also impact on 
serum holoTC concen&shy;trations. In such cases, proportionately more B12 is bound to 
holoTC leading to elevated serum holoTC levels. Therefore, in such 
rare conditions (present in 5% of older adults), holoTC might not be 
a marker of "true" intracellular B12

<b>Disease conditions</b> affecting serum holoTC levels include renal patients 
with impaired kidney function. With decreasing kidney function, levels of serum 
holoTC rise to ensure sufficient holoTC is delivered into cells.  
Therefore, in patients with renal insufficiency (assessed by measure&shy;ment 
of serum creatinine), serum holoTC concen&shy;trations may appear normal, and 
are no longer a useful biomarker to predict B12 status

Other conditions that might elevate serum holoTC concen&shy;trations include 
liver diseases and possibly the devel&shy;op&shy;ment of autoantibodies against trans&shy;cobalamin.
<p></p>
<b>High folic acid intake</b> has been associated with reduced serum holoTC concen&shy;trations. 
This adverse effect on B12 status has only been implicated with synthetic folic acid 
and not with natural folate from food sources (i.e., methyl&shy;tetra&shy;hydrofolate)

<b>Dietary B12 intakes</b> affect serum holoTC concen&shy;trations with, as expected, 
lower levels in vegans than omnivores due to their lower B12 intake. 
Serum holoTC is a better biomarker of recent B12 intake than serum&nbsp;B12 
(or methymalonic acid or tHcy) because serum holoTC concen&shy;trations 
increase much faster after ingestion of B12 from a 
meal (i.e., 6 hours) or crystal&shy;line B12 from supple&shy;ments.

<h4>Interpretive criteria</h4>

Available serum holoTC assay methods, unlike serum&nbsp;B12, give similar values 
according to a European comparison study

However, to date there is insufficient data to account for the slight differences in serum holoTC 
concen&shy;trations by age, sex, and possibly race for adults. Furthermore, uncertainty 
exists about the appropriate serum holoTC cutoff to diagnose B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency. 
For adults, the cutoff for serum holoTC, based on the relation of holoTC 
to serum methyl&shy;malonic acid, is &lt;35&#8209;40pmol/L. 
according to the BOND group. They provide no cutoff for deficiency for children.
However, for early childhood, the BOND group set tentative normal reference ranges for four 
age groups from birth to 24 months of age;

adequate/normal B12&nbsp;status  of 40&#8209;150 or 40&#8209;200pmol/L for  
healthy adults, irrespective of age and the assay used.

Based on these data, a reference interval of 40&#8209;200pmol/L is often used as indicative 
of the normal range for healthy adults. Nevertheless, where possible, it is preferable 
to establish a local reference interval for interpreting results in population-based 
studies and in clinical practice.  
<p></p>
Laboratories nowadays use a diagnostic strategy 
for B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency that involves several bio&shy;markers  with serum holoTC or B12 as the 
initial test, followed by serum methyl&shy;malonic acid or homo&shy;cysteine as the second line 
test. See Section&nbsp;22b.8 on multiple biomarkers for more discussion.

<h4>Measure&shy;ment of serum holo trans&shy;cobalamin</h4>

Several methods are available for measuring serum holoTC. They include a 
radioimmuno&shy;assay (RIA) method based on monoclonal antibodies against trans&shy;cobalamin

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8438881"

and an enzyme-linked immuno&shy;sorbent assay 
procedure that is easier to use and measures holoTC directly without sample pretreatment 

<span data-tippy-content="Brady, J., Wilson, L., McGregor, L., Valente, E., & Orning, L. (2008). Active B12: a rapid, auto&shy;mated assay for holotrans&shy;cobalamin on the Abbott AxSYM analyzer. Clinical chemistry, 54(3), 567&#8209;573.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18178666"
target="right" >Brady et al., 2008</a>). </span>

The holoTC&#8209;RIA method has now 
been replaced by an assay that uses holoTC-specific monoclonal antibodies 
and yields results comparable to those of the holoTC&#8209;RIA. An auto&shy;mated 
assay has been developed for this method using the Abbott AxSYM immuno&shy;assay analzyer

Tests have confirmed that results based on the holoTC&#8209;RIA and the 
holoTC-enzyme-linked immuno&shy;sorbent assay yield similar values

<p></p>
Blood sampling and storage conditions have limited effect on serum or 
plasma holoTC concen&shy;trations. Therefore, no special precautions are necessary 
for drawing blood samples and concen&shy;trations are stable in serum 
stored at &minus;20&deg;C to &minus;70&deg;C for at least 16&nbsp;months. Both serum and plasma 
can be used for the assay. Fasting and non-fasting blood samples 
can be used because holoTC concen&shy;trations are unaffected by the intake of a normal diet

<h3>22b.2.3 Deoxyuridine suppression test</h3>

This sensitive in vitro test has been used to diagnose early vitamin&nbsp;B12 (or folate) 
deficiency even in the absence of morphological changes in the blood.  It was 
developed by Killman

Abnormal deoxyuridine suppression is the biochemical expression of disordered DNA 
meta&shy;bolism.  Although either lymphocytes or whole blood can be used for this 
test to detect past vitamin&nbsp;B12 or folate status, generally bone marrow cells are 
preferred because they measure the acute status

and is not specific to vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency.

<h3>22b.2.4 Serum methyl&shy;malonic acid</h3>

Methylmalonic acid (MMA) accumulates in the serum or plasma when the supply of 
vitamin&nbsp;B12 is reduced; it does not rise in folate deficiency 

<span data-tippy-content="Savage, D. G., Lindenbaum, J., Stabler, S. P., & Allen, R. H. (1994).

Hence, the measure&shy;ment of methyl&shy;malonic acid in serum or plasma, is a 
sensitive and specific marker of tissue vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency, reflecting stores 
rather than intake. Concen&shy;trations are elevated in vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency, even in 
the absence of clinical signs or symptoms or of morphological changes in the 
blood. For example, in a cross-sectional study of 2919 Dutch elderly people 
with elevated serum homo&shy;cysteine (tHcy) levels (i.e., >12 mol/L), 
the association of total serum&nbsp;B12 levels with serum MMA (and tHcy) 
was explored with restricted cubic splines

Of the participants, 
50% were women and all were >65 years (mean age of 74.1 years) 
with a mean BMI of 27.1. Even with concen&shy;trations of serum total B12 below about 330pmol/L, 
a rise in both serum MMA (and tHcy) levels was observed, with an even steeper 
increase when total serum&nbsp;B12 levels fell to below 220pmol/L. 
These findings are in line with other studies, which have 
observed inflections, or change points with serum total B12 
concen&shy;trations between 200 and 500pmol/L. 
In the Dutch study, serum MMA (and serum tHcy) also rose 
when serum HoloTC concen&shy;trations fell to less than about 100pmol/L

The validity of serum or plasma methyl&shy;malonic acid concen&shy;trations as a sensitive 
and specific test for the diagnosis of nutritional vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency during 
infancy has also been explored.  The results of a study of 41&nbsp;Dutch infants on 
macrobiotic diets and 50 healthy omnivorous controls 

<a href="#table22b.6">(Table&nbsp;22b.6</a>)	

showed markedly higher plasma methyl&shy;malonic 
acid concen&shy;trations in the infants on 
macrobiotic diets compared to the controls

Moreover, plasma 
methyl&shy;malonic acid concen&shy;trations were inversely related to plasma vitamin&nbsp;B12 
levels. Logistic regression showed that methyl&shy;malonic acid followed by total 
homo&shy;cysteine and cobalamin in plasma, in that order, were the strongest 
predictors of vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency in the macrobiotic group.

Serum methyl&shy;malonic acid concen&shy;trations are not only a sensitive biomarker 
but also a very specific biomarker of functional vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency.  
Only a few conditions confound their use as outlined below.

<h4>Factors affecting serum methymalonic acid</h4>

<b>Age</b> tends to increase serum MMA concen&shy;trations, particularly in persons >70y. 
This trend was reported in the US NHANES 2013&#8209;2014 survey of adults >20 years, 
with levels about 60% higher in those aged >70y compared to the youngest age 
group (i.e., 20&#8209;39 y)

It is of interest that this age-related trend in serum MMA levels 
was apparent even among persons in the NHANES 2013&#8209;2014 survey with 
serum total B12 concen&shy;trations indicative of replete B12 status (i.e., >300pmol/L) 
and with normal renal function, as shown in <a href="#table22b.8">Table&nbsp;22b.8</a>.

<b>Ethnicity</b> affects serum MMA. In both the US NHANES 2011&#8209; and 2013&#8209;2014 surveys,  
non-Hispanic white persons had higher serum MMA (about 25%) concen&shy;trations 
than non-Hispanic black persons, even after adjustment 
for other covariates

<p></p>
<b>Pregnancy</b> affects serum/plasma MAA. In a longitudinal study of 
healthy women during pregnancy, after correction for hemodilution, 
plasma MMA concen&shy;trations showed a moderate increase throughout 
pregnancy from 20 weeks gestation

The increase was interpreted to indicate a depletion of maternal 
intracellular vitamin&nbsp;B12 stores during pregnancy. Other reports, 
however,  propose that an increase in plasma or serum MMA during pregnancy is normal 
and does not reflect a low vitamin&nbsp;B12 status and caution that serum 
MAA may not be a reliable biomarker of vitamin&nbsp;B12 status among pregnant women

<h4>Interpretive criteria</h4>

Currently there is no consensus for the cutoff value for serum MMA acid 
concen&shy;trations indicative of vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency. Two tentative “cutoffs” for 
deficiency in adults are presented in Table 22b.4 from the BOND group

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30500928"
target="right" >Allen et al., 2018</a>). </span>

These so called cutoffs are derived from serum MMA concen&shy;trations compiled from 
US NHANES 2003&#8209;2006 data in which the central 95% reference intervals 
(2.5th to 97.5th percentile) for serum MMA concen&shy;trations were 
presented

argues that use of only one serum MAA cutoff 
point can result in those with a B12 status considered intermediate 
being misclassified into the sufficient and deficient groups. 
To resolve this uncertainty, these investigators examined the complex 
relation between serum&nbsp;B12 and MMA (adjusted age, glomerular filtration rate, 
and hours of fasting) based on data from 12,683 adult participants of the 
NHANES 1999&#8209;2004 study.  Based on statistical modeling, 
those participants with a serum&nbsp;B12 &lt;126pmol/L had the highest serum MMA 
(ie., median 281nmol) whereas for those with a serum&nbsp;B12 >287pmol/L 
(who likely had adequate B12 status), serum MMA was low (i.e., 120nmol/L). 
They also identified an intermediate group (i.e., between those with severe B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency 
and those with optimal vitamin&nbsp;B12 status) who were defined by a serum MMA of 
148nmol/L, although their vitamin&nbsp;B12 status was difficult to interpret. 
<p></p>
A range of adequate/normal serum MAA concen&shy;trations for infants and children 
up to 2y are also provided by the BOND group 
<a href="#table22b.4">(See Table&nbsp;22b.4)</a>.
These values are from the same sample of well-nourished breastfed 
Norwegian infants used to set the age-specific adequate/normal values for serum&nbsp;B12.   
Data from the US&nbsp;NHANES 2011&#8209;2014 survey have been used to establish 95%&nbsp;reference 
intervals for serum MMA concentrations by age for US&nbsp;adults >20y.
Reference intervals for serum MMA based on the 
overall sample are available and also on a sub&shy;pop&shy;ulation with serum&nbsp;B12 values 
said to be indicative of B12 repletion (i.e., &ge;300pmol/L) 
and normal renal function based on serum creatinine
<a href="#table22b.8">(See Table&nbsp;22b.8)</a>. 
Pregnant and lacating women were excluded in both datasets. 
<p></p>
Not surprisingly, these age-specific central 95% reference intervals 
established for healthy adults 
(i.e., with serum&nbsp;B12 >300pmol/L and normal renal function)
are lower than the upper&#8209;end MMA cutoffs in 
earlier reports whose participants were from "apparently healthy populations" 
but with an unknown clinical history. In these earlier reports, 
some older participants probably had impaired renal function that was not considered.  
Clearly, in studies designed to establish adequate/normal serum MAA adult values, 
it is advisable to evaluate renal function using serum creatinine, 
especially in older adults. 
<p></p>
Note that if both serum methyl&shy;malonic acid and homo&shy;cysteine are analysed, a 
distinction can be made between vitamin&nbsp;B12 and folate deficiencies.  Elevated 
levels of both metabolites are expected in vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency, whereas in 
folate deficiency, only increases in serum homo&shy;cysteine concen&shy;trations occur.

<h4>Measure&shy;ment of serum methyl&shy;malonic acid </h4>

The analytical procedures most frequently used for serum
methyl&shy;malonic acid involve liquid chrom&shy;atography-tandem 
mass spec&shy;troscopy (LC&#8209;MS/MS). 
Advantages of these procedures include the small sample size needed, 
their high throughput, and good precision. A summary table of the characteristics 
of the differing LC&#8209;MS/MS procedures available is presented in Jin et al.

In some cases, the LC&#8209;MS/MS procedure has been used to analyze MMA in serum, 
urine, or  dried blood spots. The major drawshy;back of the LC&#8209;MS/MS procedures 
is their cost, the availability and maintenance of the equipment, 
and expertise required

A more cost-effective method requiring small volumes of reagents with high 
throughput has been developed for serum MAA using stable-isotope-dilution LC&#8209;MS/MS.

deficiency among the elderly

Levels of MMA in serum are stable for several years, when samples are stored at &minus;70&deg;C. 

<h3>22b.2.5 Urinary methyl&shy;malonic acid excretion </h3>

Vitamin&nbsp;B12 serves as a cofactor for methylmalonyl CoA mutase (EC 5.4.99.2) 
as noted earlier.This enzyme acts in the conver&shy;sion of methylmalonyl CoA to 
succinyl CoA <a href="#figure22b.7">(Figure&nbsp;22b.7)</a>. Therefore, in vitamin&nbsp;B12 
deficiency, methyl&shy;malonic acid accumulates in the blood and is excreted by

The biomarker methyl&shy;malonic acid in urine is sensitive, 
detecting early functional vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency before the 
onset of macrocytic anemia, as noted for MMA in serum. 
Similarly, this test is also highly specific and is not affected 
by folate deficiency.  Only rare congenital enzyme defects 
discussed earlier (i.e., methyl&shy;malonic aciduria) interfere with the test.

In elderly patients with renal disease, methyl&shy;malonic acid accumulates 
so levels in urine, like serum, are elevated leading to a decreased

<h4>Interpretive criteria and measure&shy;ment of methyl&shy;malonic acid in urine</h4>

The reduced specificity of plasma  MMA during renal impairment has led to the 
devel&shy;op&shy;ment of the uMMA/C ratio in the diagnosis of B12 deficiency.
A threshold for uMMA/C ratios of 1.45&micro;mol/mmol has been established 
for adult patients with plasma&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations in the low-normal 
range (i.e., 201&#8209;350ng/L). This threshold has good diagnostic performance for 
B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency in patients with subnormal serum or plasma&nbsp;B12 concen&shy;trations 
and renal impairment

Assay of urine for MMA avoids the need for blood collection, 
although excretion of urinary MMA increases after meals. 
Analysis of 24h urine samples avoids this problem, but collection of 24hr urine 
samples is hard to achieve.  Instead, analyses of two casual urine 
samples to correct for variability in the MMA concen&shy;tration in urine can be used. 
<p></p>
Combined gas/ liquid - chrom&shchcy;atography mass-spec&shy;trometry techniques 
(LC&#8209;MS/MS or GC&#8209;MS/MS) are used to measure MMA in urine,

<h3>22b.2.6 Red blood cell methyl&shy;malonic acid</h3>

Unrecognized deficiency of vitamin&nbsp;B12 during early childhood 
can lead to long-term health outcomes in children including impaired 
cognitive function and devel&shy;op&shy;mental delay. Maternal B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency 
during pregnancy is the most common cause of vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency 
during early infancy, as both B12 fetal stores and vitamin&nbsp;B12 
concen&shy;trations in breast milk are low.  During later infancy and 
early childhood inadequate intakes of B12 due to low intake of 
animal-source foods and possibly mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion, 
may play a role

Methylmalonic acid is considered the most specific functional 
biomarker and a sensitive indicator for B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency, as noted earlier. 
In many countries, analysis of dried blood spots are used as a 
diagnostic tool for newborn screening. In many countries, however, 
even though dried blood spots are collected routinely from newborns, 
the blood spots are not routinely screened for B12 status.  
Therefore, develo&shy;ping a sensitive assay of MMA in dried blood spots 
through a newborn screening programme has the potential to facilitate 
the timely diagnosis and treatment of neonatal B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency. 
Such a method in dried blood spots could also facilitate 
testing B12 status in large-scale surveys and in remote populations 

<span data-tippy-content="Schroder, T. H., Quay, T. A., & Lamers, Y. (2014).

A new highly sensitive procedure based on stable isotope dilution with liquid

The mean dried blood spot MMA concen&shy;tration quantified from 
160 newborns was 16.8pmol/L (95th CI:15.9&#8209;17.6pmol/L per 8&#8209;mmspot), 
with 95% reference intervals (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) 
for MMA of 9.89 to 29.3pmol/8&#8209;mm blood spot (0.450 to 1.33&micro;mol/L whole blood).  
Concen&shy;trations of MMA above the upper limit of this reference interval 
indicate an increased risk of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency. 
The establishment of this neonatal MMA reference interval in 
dried blood spots will assist in the timely diagnosis and treatment of 
neonatal B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency through newborn screening programmes. 
To date, comparable reference intervals for MMA in dried 
blood spots of adults have not been established.
<p></p>
Concen&shy;trations of MMA in dried blood spots increase with storage 
at room temper&shy;ature so care must be taken to store dried blood spots 
below &minus;80&deg;C prior to analysis. Nevertheless, because storage at 
room temper&shy;ature for at least one week has no effect on the dried 
blood spot MMA concen&shy;trations, they can be shipped at room temper&shy;ature

<h3>22b.2.7 Measure&shy;ment of vitamin&nbsp;B12 absorption</h3>

Once vitamin&nbsp;B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency has been diagnosed, 
it is often of interest to establish if 
mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion is the cause. Originally, the Schilling test was used for this purpose, 
but it is no longer used in view of the safety factors related to the use of radioactive B12 
(<sup>57</sup>Co&#8209;cyanocobalamin)

either the change in serum holoTC (CobaSorb) concen&shy;trations or the 
absorption of microbially produced cobalamin labeled with <sup>14</sup>Carbon or

<b>CobaSorb test</b> depends on the fact that newly absorbed B12 circulates 
in the plasma as holoTC. The test is used to clarify whether the B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency 
diagnosed in a person is caused by an inability to absorb the vitamin. 
It is important that the test is performed before participants are treated for B12&nbsp;deficiency  
in order to detect an increase in serum holoTC.
The test is based on the analysis of serum holoTC prior to and 
following an oral dose of unlabeled B12.  
For the test, first a blood sample is taken to measure plasma holoTC, 
after which a dose of 9&micro;g of crystalline&nbsp;B12 in water is given 
orally at 6h intervals over a 24h period. The next day, 
a second blood sample is taken, so that the change in the amount of 
B12&nbsp;bound to serum holoTC can be determined. 
A small or no increase in holoTC is indicative of mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion.  
The test measures relative absorption and does not provide a 
quantitative estimate of B12 bioavailability

<h3>22b.2.8 Multiple biomarkers</h3>

Defects in the hematopoietic system do not generally occur until the final 
stage of B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency. At this stage, the hemato&shy;logical defects are 
indistinguishable from those of folate deficiency and include megalo&shy;blastic 
anemia, characterized by macro-ovalocytic erythrocytes, abnormal red cell indices, 
and a low hemoglobin concen&shy;tration (see Chapter&nbsp;17, Sections&nbsp;17.2.7 and 17.4). 
However, identifying impaired vitamin&nbsp;B12 status in the earlier stages is more 
challenging, but can be enhanced by using one or more plasma biomarkers 
of B12&nbsp;status. No single biochemical biomarker is suitable for 
diagnosing B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency in all persons, and the use of several biomarkers 
is preferred.  For a useful summary table comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of 
the B12&nbsp;biomarkers, see Allen et al.

Algorithms based either on a selection of biomarkers measured 
sequentially or, multiple biomarkers analyzed simultaneously and then combined 
into a single diagnostic indicator, are both approaches that are used to circumvent 
the inherent limitations of each individual biomarker. 
<p></p>
Algorithms based on the selection of sequential assays are used by several 
laboratories to assess B12 status. For example, initially, serum 
total B12 or serum holoTC can be measured, and if the concen&shy;tration 
is deemed low (i.e., serum&nbsp;B12&lt;148pmol/L or serum holoTC&lt;35pmol/L), 
then B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency is diagnosed.

Total serum&nbsp;B12 and MMA are included in the figure. HoloTC may replace total B12 
as a first line test, and homo&shy;cysteine may be used instead of MMA, notably 
in folate replete populations. 
*&nbsp;For patients with an eGFR below the reference interval
(60mL/min), an elevated serum MMA concentration may be caused by the 
impaired kidney function rather than B12 deficiency.

However, if the concen&shy;tration of 
either serum&nbsp;B12 or holoB12 is in the intermediate range between 
inadequate and adequate B12 status (i.e., between 148 and 250pmol/L for 
serum total&nbsp;B12 or between 35&nbsp;and 50pmol/L for serum holoTC), then a functional 
biomarker such as serum methymalonic acid or serum homo&shy;cysteine is 
measured as the second-line test. If either serum methyl&shy;malonic acid or 
homo&shy;cysteine is considered elevated, then B12&nbsp;defi&shy;ciency is diagnosed.

<b>Concurrent measure&shy;ment of several biomarkers</b> is an alternative to 
sequential approaches. In the original mathematical model four biomarkers are combined: 
serum holoTC, serum&nbsp;B12, serum methyl&shy;malonic acid (MMA), 
serum homo&shy;cysteine (Hcy) to yield a 
combined indicator termed the cB12 or 4cB12. The combined four-component algorithm 
adjusts for age and folate status, in view of the likely increase 
in serum MAA with age in the elderly, and the increase in serum Hcy in 
folate deficiency. 4cB12 can be calculated:
<p></p>
4cB12=log10[(holoTC.B12)/MMA.Hcy)]-(age factor)
<p></p>
The model 4cB12 is currently considered the best biomarker stratification for 
B12 status and yields one of five diagnoses: elevated B12, adequate B12, 
decreased B12, possible B12 deficient, and probably B12 deficient. 
The advantage of 4cB12 is that it is independent of local reference 
values and can be adjusted to correct for folate status and age. However, 
cost is a major disadvantage of the 4cB12 model as well as lack of 
availability of all four tests in routine clinical practice. 
<p></p>
Suggested cutoffs and the interpretation of values of the combined 4cB12 indicator 
for  use by researchers and clinicians and for epidemiologic purposes are shown in Table 22b.10 .

So far these cutoffs for 4cB12 have been validated against hemoglobin concen&shy;trations 
and cognitive status (based on the Mini Mental State Examination), 
although additional validation studies using other cognitive and 
neuro&shy;logical outcomes are needed. As yet, the 4cB12 model has not 
been validated for use in pregnancy but has proven very useful in the 
research setting

More recently, in view of the drawbacks of 4cB12, 
refined models have been developed based on "missing" biomarkers.
These alternative cB12 equations, missing one (3cB12) or two (2cB12) 
biomarkers of B12 status, have been compared with the 
established four-parameter 4cB12.  Revised cut-points and guidelines 
for using this approach can be found in Fedosov et al.

The missing biomarker methods need further validation, especially for use in pregnancy and early childhood.
