<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
This chapter covers two related but distinct topics: 
Food-based dietary guidelines and assessment of population-level diet quality. 
Definitions of diet quality, food-based dietary guidelines, 
and assessment measures have all evolved over time, reflecting new and emerging 
scientific evidence for diet-health relationships.
<p></p>
Food-based dietary guidelines are developed by national health 
authorities for use by consumers, practitioners, and policymakers. 
Such guidelines translate current scientific knowledge about relationships 
between food intakes and health outcomes into clear population-level guidance. 
In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of the development 
and communication of guidelines and describe a global repository 
for food-based dietary guidelines. We summarize areas of 
consistency across guidelines and highlight some possible 
future directions, including incorporation of environmental sustainability concerns.
<p></p>
In the second part of the chapter, we describe approaches to 
assessing diet quality, particularly at the population level. Numerous metrics 
(indicators, indices, and scores) have been developed to 
summarize diet quality, reflecting different definitions of diet quality and also 
different measurement objectives. Widely used metrics include 
measures of adherence to national food-based dietary guidelines 
such as the U.S. Healthy Eating Index, measures of adherence 
to healthy regional diets such as Mediterranean diet scores 
and indices, and other measures developed based 
on epidemiological evidence linking dietary patterns and 
characteristics to health outcomes.
<p></p>
Using a series of examples, we describe how diet quality 
metrics are developed, evaluated, and used. Most scores 
and indices require detailed quantitative dietary 
intake and food composition data. However, several measures 
have been developed for use in contexts where such data are 
not available and simpler measures are required, 
and we include examples of these. Finally, as with food-based 
dietary guidelines, concerns with environmental impacts of 
diets and food systems are growing, which 
will likely result in new metrics incorporating this dimension.

<h2> 8c. Dietary Guidelines and Assessing Diet Quality</h2>

This chapter covers two related but distinct topics: Food-based dietary 
guide&shy;lines, often provided by national health authorities, and assess&shy;ment 
of diet quality. The section on assess&shy;ment of diet quality has a primary 
focus on applications at the popu&shy;lation level, for monitoring diet 
quality, assessing diet-disease associ&shy;ations, and evaluating policy and 
programmatic inter&shy;ventions. The two topics in this section are linked in 
this popu&shy;lation-level focus, and because assess&shy;ment of diet quality is 
some&shy;times approached through assessing adherence to national food-based 
dietary guide&shy;lines. However, the section also covers a range of other 
approaches to assessing diet quality in popu&shy;lations.
Learning objectives for readers include gaining understanding of:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>The role of food-based dietary guide&shy;lines in communi&shy;cating guidance 
from national health authorities;
<li>The range of topics covered by food-based dietary guide&shy;lines, and some 
areas of consistency and difference across various national guide&shy;lines;
<li>The evolution of definitions of diet quality, and how this has 
influenced assess&shy;ment of diet quality;
<li>The wide diversity of diet quality indices currently in use;
<li>Some of the main types of indices, including those based on national 
food-based dietary guide&shy;lines, on regional diets, and on other summaries 
of evidence for diet-health relation&shy;ships;
<li>How indices differ in their devel&shy;op&shy;ment, measurement (data sources), 
calculation and use;
<li>Which indices have lower data require&shy;ments for their calculation;
<li>How new concerns with sustain&shy;ability and planetary health may affect 
diet quality definitions and assess&shy;ment.
</ul>

<h2>8c.1 Food-based dietary guide&shy;lines</h2>

This section provides a brief overview of the devel&shy;op&shy;ment and 
communi&shy;cation of food-based dietary guide&shy;lines (FBDGs), with a focus on 
those devel&shy;oped by national authorities. The section also describes a 
global archive for FBDGs and comments on areas of consistency across 
national guide&shy;lines. The section concludes with comments on likely future 
directions for FBDGs.
<p></p>
Science-based guidance on healthy diets is available from a variety
of sources, including from national governments, inter&shy;national
authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and medical and dietetic professional societies, among others. 
<p></p>
FBDGs translate current scientific
knowledge about relation&shy;ships between food intakes and health
out&shy;comes into clear popu&shy;lation-level guidance. They 
are &ldquo;food-based&rdquo; in contrast to guidance 
on nutri&shy;ent intakes such as various
Nutrient Reference Values (see Section&nbsp;8b.1). They often provide advice
and guidance on dietary patterns &mdash; what to eat and drink, how
often, and in what amount. In this Section, we focus on FBDGs
devel&shy;oped at the national level.
<p></p>
The earliest dietary guidance from national governments was
focused on ensuring nutri&shy;ent adequacy of diets 

<span data-tippy-content="Harper, A. E. (1987). Evolution of recommended dietary allowances &mdash; new directions?. Annual review of nutrition, 7, 509&ndash;537.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3300745"
target="right" >Harper, 1987</a>).</span>

However, by the late 20th century the focus shifted to include a
strong emphasis on reducing risks for non-communicable diseases
(NCDs, such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, 
type&nbsp;2 diabetes, and cancers), while still ensuring nutri&shy;ent 
adequacy.
<p></p> More recently, there have been calls to integrate consider&shy;ations of
envi&shy;ron&shy;mental sustain&shy;ability into FBDGs; however, to date this has
been rare 

<span data-tippy-content="Gonzalez Fischer, C. & Garnett, T. (2016). Plates, Pyramids, and Planets: Developments in National Healthy and Sustainable Dietary Guidelines:A State of Play Assessment. Rome: FAO.">

target="right" >Gonzalez Fischer & Garnett, 2016</a>;</span>

<span data-tippy-content="Springmann, M., Spajic, L., Clark, M. A., Poore, J., Herforth, A., Webb, P., Rayner, M., & Scarborough, P. (2020). The healthiness and sustain&shy;ability of national and global food based dietary guide&shy;lines: modelling study. BMJ (Clinical research ed.), 370, m2322.">
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669369"
target="right" >Springmann et&nbsp;al., 2020</a>).</span>

Some FBDGs also integrate guidance on physical activity,
food safety, food skills (such as choosing healthier foods while
shopping, and preparing meals), the role of ultra-processed foods,
and other topics.

<h3>8c.1.1   Development of national-level food-based dietary guide&shy;lines</h3>

<p></p>
WHO and FAO have provided guidance to coun&shy;tries on how to
develop FBDGs 

<span data-tippy-content="Preparation and use of food-based dietary guide&shy;lines. Report of a joint FAO/WHO consultation. FAO/WHO. (1998). World Health Organization technical report series, 880, i&ndash;108.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9795598"
target="right" >WHO/FAO, 1998</a>).</span>

This devel&shy;op&shy;ment process for
national FBDGs was summarized by the European Food Safety
Authority 

<span data-tippy-content="European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). (2010). Scientific Opinion on Establishing Food-Based Dietary Guidelines. EFSA Journal 8 (3): 1460. ">
(<a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1460"
target="right" >European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 2010</a>)</span>

as including the following steps:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Identify diet-health relation&shy;ships (based on national but also
global evidence);
<li>Using national data sources, identify:
<ul>
<li class="circle">Diet-related health problems;
<li class="circle">Nutrients of public health importance;
<li class="circle">Food groups relevant for FBDGs (for example, food 
groups with known links to health out&shy;comes, and for sources of nutri&shy;ents 
of public health importance); 
<li class="circle">Food con&shy;sump&shy;tion patterns;
</ul>
<li>Test FBDGs with audiences and refine them;
<li>Develop graphical representations of FBDGs.
</ul>
The devel&shy;op&shy;ment of FBDGs requires synthesis of a wide range of
evidence and contextual infor&shy;mation, although in practice, some
types of infor&shy;mation may not be available. For example, many
coun&shy;tries lack recent and nationally representative infor&shy;mation on
food con&shy;sump&shy;tion patterns.
<p></p>
The process also calls for the involvement of multiple stakeholders
and can be both a technical and a political process. Through
considering food con&shy;sump&shy;tion patterns and cultural dietary
prefer&shy;ences, the resulting guide&shy;lines should allow for flexibility in
food choices, addressing socioeconomic constraints and respecting
cultural diversity within national popu&shy;lations (WHO/FAO 1998).
<p></p>
A majority of national FBDGs include some type of summary graphic,
some&shy;times called a food guide, to convey concepts like diversity and
pro&shy;por&shy;tionality among different food groups. The graphics
some&shy;times also include specific details on quan&shy;tities (standard
servings per day or per week) for various food groups.
<p></p>
Examples of summary graphics include images of healthy plates,
food pyramids, food baskets, or other cultural shapes 

Three examples are shown in 
<a href="#figure8c.1">Figure&nbsp;8c.1</a>

Some coun&shy;tries provide several graphic images, such as
both a pyramid and a healthy plate. See, for example, images for the 
<a href="https://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/regions/countries/finland/en/"

and the 
<a href="https://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/regions/countries/switzerland/en/"
target="right" >Swiss FBDGs</a>.

<h3>8c.1.2   Communication and imple&shy;men&shy;tation of national-level food-based
dietary guide&shy;lines</h3>

FBDGs aim to provide actionable guidance for consumers and for
public health and medical practitioners. Full imple&shy;men&shy;tation of
FBDGs includes not only devel&shy;op&shy;ment of a variety of targeted
consumer educa&shy;tion strategies and materials, but also integration
within a range of sectoral policies and programs to help ensure that
healthy diets are available, accessible, and affordable 

<span data-tippy-content="Wijesinha-Bettoni, R., Khosravi, A., Ramos, A. I., Sherman, J., Hernandez-Garbanzo, Y., Molina, V., Vargas, M., & Hachem, F.. (2021). A snapshot of food-based dietary guide&shy;lines imple&shy;men&shy;tation in selected coun&shy;tries. Global Food Security, 29, 100533.">
(<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912421000432"
target="right" >Wijesinha-Bettoni et&nbsp;al., 2021</a>).</span>

Policies and programs include those related to
public procurement of foods (for example, for feeding in schools and
other institutions), taxes and food subsidies, and various food
security, nutrition and agricultural policies and programs.
More infor&shy;mation on imple&shy;men&shy;tation of FBDGs is available from
<a href="https://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/background/implementation/en/"
target="right" >FAO</a>.
<p></p>
Given these varied uses, governments develop a variety of
documents and tools to communi&shy;cate and implement the FBDGs.
These may include:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Technical documents detailing the process of evidence
review and justifying each guide&shy;line statement, or key
message. Technical documents may include results of
systematic reviews of evidence on diet-health relation&shy;ships,
diet modeling studies, and/or refer&shy;ences to systematic
reviews from other sources  (see, for example, 
<a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/eating-and-activity-guidelines/evidence-eating-and-activity-statements"
target="right" >New Zealand's documentation of evidence</a>);

<li>Sector-specific policies, regulations and guidance; for
example, policies and guidance for imple&shy;men&shy;tation of
school meals programs that incorporate the national FBDGs
(see, for example, 
<a href="
https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-01-26/pdf/2012-1010.pdf"
target="right" >U.S. regulations for school meals programs</a>);

<li>Guidance for public health and medical practitioners, which
may be at an inter&shy;mediate technical level, and with a
practical focus to help them translate the FBDGs for
consumers (see, for example, 
<a href="
https://food-guide.canada.ca/sites/default/files/artifact-pdf/CDG-EN-2018.pdf"
target="right" >Canada's Dietary Guidelines for Health Professionals and Policy Makers</a> );

<li>Short, simple consumer-facing documents such as
brochures, posters, and brief graphical food guides with
advice on food groups (see, for example, 
<a href="
https://wiredhealthresources.net/presentations/82/story_content/external_files/Benin.pdf"
target="right" >the food guide
graphic and tri-fold brochure from Benin</a>);

<li>Consumer-facing internet pages and applications that
provide a variety of tools for learning and self-assess&shy;ment
(see, for example,  
<a href="https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/"
target="right" >Canada's Food Guide webpage</a>).

</li>
</ul>
When evaluating the impact of programs and policies, it is often
desirable to measure and assess adherence to dietary guidance. See
Section&nbsp;8c.2 for a discussion of different approaches to assessing
diet quality and adherence to dietary guidance. Once fully
implemented, the FBDGs themselves should also be evaluated for their effectivenes; 
information on evaluation of FBDGs is also available at 
<a href="https://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/background/evaluation/en/"
target="right" >FAO</a>.
However, up to the present,
infor&shy;mation on effectiveness is limited.

<h3>   8c.1.3   Repository of national food-based dietary guidelines</h3>

The FAO maintains

<a href="
https://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/home/en/"
target="right" >a repository of national FBDGs</a>,

which currently (December, 2021) includes FBDGs for 95 coun&shy;tries.  
Each country page includes 
standard infor&shy;mation provided by national authorities for most or all 
coun&shy;tries (see Box&nbsp;8c.1). 

<div class="smallbox">
<b>Box&nbsp;8c.1     Information on national food-based dietary guide&shy;lines.</b>
<ul class="padded">
<li>	Official name of the country's dietary guide&shy;lines;
<li>Publication year of the most recent guide&shy;lines;
<li>Development process and stakeholders involved;
<li>Intended audience and age groups covered;
<li>Description of the food guide graphic;
<li>Key messages;
<li>Links to a variety of downloadable materials, including food
guides and technical documents, and to relevant
government websites if applicable.
</ul>
</div>
In addition to the infor&shy;mation in Box&nbsp;8c.1, available 
for most or all coun&shy;tries, newly
updated country pages may also include infor&shy;mation on imple&shy;men&shy;tation,
evaluation, and incorporation of sustain&shy;ability concerns.
<p></p>
FBDGs are currently (December, 2021) 
available at the repository for 33&nbsp;European
coun&shy;tries, 31&nbsp;coun&shy;tries in the Americas, and 18&nbsp;coun&shy;tries in the 
Asia-Pacific region, but for only 7&nbsp;African coun&shy;tries. Availability varies by
country income classification, with FBDGs available for slightly over
half of all high- and upper-middle-income coun&shy;tries, just over 
one-quarter of lower-middle-income coun&shy;tries, and for fewer than one
in ten low-income coun&shy;tries (based on

<a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519/"
target="right" >World Bank 2021 country income classifications</a>).

<h3>8c.1.4    Coverage of sub-popu&shy;lations</h3>

Countries have taken different approaches to providing guidance for
specific age groups and physiological conditions:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>
Some coun&shy;tries have taken a life-cycle approach in a single
dietary guide&shy;lines document, and include sections with
specific guidance for infants, young children, school-aged
children, adolescents, and for pregnant and lactating
women (see, for example, 
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Kenya's National Guidelines for
Healthy Diets and Physical Activity">
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjh78X89PnwAhXqxTgGHYiiD2sQFjABegQIBBAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnak.or.ke%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F12%2FNATIONAL-GUIDELINES-FOR-HEALTHY-DIETS-AND-PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY-2017-NEW-EDIT.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2hQLSRuApXI0eTmEidh6AD"
target="right" > Kenya's National Guidelines for
Healthy Diets and Physical Activity</a>).</span>

<li>
Other coun&shy;tries have devel&shy;oped separate technical
documents and/or consumer-facing guidance documents for
some or all age and physiological groups (see, for example,
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="New Zealand's technical background papers">
<a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/eating-and-activity-guidelines/current-guidelines"
target="right" >New Zealand's technical background papers	
and consumer resources for different age groups</a>).</span>
<li>
Other coun&shy;tries state that the main dietary guide&shy;lines
document and key messages apply to all healthy individuals
&ge;&nbsp;2y, but they may still highlight the
needs of age groups or other sub-groups (vegetarians,
pregnant or lactating women) within the main guide&shy;lines
document (see, for example, Lebanon's 
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Lebanon's Food-based Dietary
Guidelines">
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiNqtaZ-vnwAhWb3jgGHcp8A5YQFjADegQIAhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aub.edu.lb%2Ffafs%2Fnfsc%2FDocuments%2FFBDG%2520English%2520Version.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0h6aohqvvY8tH8DZ2a1J7P"
target="right" >Food-based Dietary Guidelines </a>).</span>
<li>
The most common age group with separate and specific
guidance is infants and young children under two years of
age (see, for example, 

<a href="https://www.fao.org/3/CA1014ES/ca1014es.pdf"
target="right" >technical</a>
and
<a href="https://www.fao.org/3/CA1017ES/ca1017es.pdf"
target="right" >consumer-facing</a>
 FBDG for Panama).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>8c.1.5   Consistency of national food-based dietary guide&shy;lines</h3>

Commonalities and differences among national FBDGs graphics and
key messages were described in several recent reviews 

<span data-tippy-content="Altamirano Mart&iacute;nez, M. B., Cordero Mu&ntilde;oz, A. Y., Macedo Ojeda, G., M&aacute;rquez Sandoval, Y. F., & Vizmanos, B. (2015).

<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041447"
target="right" >Herforth et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>).</span>

All reviews summarized food guide graphics and noted that the two
most commonly used graphics were versions of a pyramid or a
plate / food circle. The remainder of this section is based on the
review by Herforth et&nbsp;al. 

<span data-tippy-content="Herforth, A., Arimond, M., &Aacute;lvarez-S&aacute;nchez, C., Coates, J., Christianson, K., & Muehlhoff, E. (2019). A Global Review of Food-Based Dietary Guidelines. Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.), 10(4), 590&ndash;605.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041447"
target="right" >2019</a>).</span>

<p></p>
Nearly all food guide graphics conveyed the importance of food
group diversity and pro&shy;por&shy;tionality &mdash; that 
is, that some food groups
should be consumed in larger quan&shy;tities than others. However, only
about one-third gave quantitative infor&shy;mation on recom&shy;mended
amounts per day or per week (either in grams or as the number of
servings). Most graphics included depiction of fats and oils and of
sugars / sweets, showing them as small in pro&shy;por&shy;tion to other
groups. About one-third included depictions of other foods to be
consumed in moderation, such as pizza, hamburgers, or salty snacks.
About half included depictions of water, and about half included
depictions of physical activity.
<p></p>
Excluding depiction of food groups to consume in moderation, the
most common number of food groups depicted was four or five,
with the most common groupings being: (1) Starchy staple foods; (2)
Fruits and vegetables (either as one group or as two separate
groups); (3) Dairy; and (4) Other protein foods (meat, poultry, fish,
eggs, legumes, and some&shy;times nuts).
<p></p>
However, there was variability in whether legumes were grouped
with protein foods, with vegetables, or with both. Dairy was
frequently a separate group but was some&shy;times grouped with other
protein foods. Many coun&shy;tries did not depict nuts or grouped them
with fats and oils rather than with protein foods. Other
incon&shy;sisten&shy;cies related to how potatoes were classified (as starchy
staples, or as vegetables) and in whether fruit juice was depicted
with whole fruits.

salt, added sugar, and fats (partic&shy;ularly saturated and trans-fats).
Only about one-half of coun&shy;tries emphasized whole grain intake.
Key messages encouraging dairy intake were nearly universal in
Europe and North America but were less common in Asia, Africa,
and Latin America. Some FBDGs provided inconsistent messages on
unsaturated fats, with positive key messages indi&shy;cating to choose
them but with graphics grouping the healthier choices (nuts and
oils) together with less healthy ones (saturated fats) as groups to
moderate.

<h3>8c.1.6  Future directions for food-based dietary guide&shy;lines</h3>

Recent FBDGs from several coun&shy;tries have highlighted the need to
consider envi&shy;ron&shy;mental sustain&shy;ability in addition to concerns with
nutri&shy;ent adequacy and NCD risk reduction. For example, 
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="FBDG Brazil 2014">

also includes a
key message on envi&shy;ron&shy;mental protection.  WHO and FAO have
also articulated guiding principles for sustain&shy;able healthy diets 

<span data-tippy-content="FAO and WHO. (2019). “Sustainable Healthy Diets &ndash; Guiding Principles.” Rome.">
(<a href="http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/ca6640en/"
target="right" >FAO & WHO, 2019</a>).</span>

As noted above, the FAO repository for FBDG has
begun documenting country-level attention to sustain&shy;ability.
<p></p>
Several recently published FBDGs also include a stronger focus on
behaviors to help achieve healthy eating patterns. Several of the
same coun&shy;tries noted above (Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay), as well as
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Canada food guide - guide&shy;lines">
<a href="https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/guidelines/"
target="right" >Canada</a></span>,	
include key messages and guidance around food skills,
social aspects of eating (enjoying meals with family and with others),
and/or being an informed consumer through reading labels and
understanding food industry marketing practices. A number of
coun&shy;tries also provide guidance to reduce intake of highly processed
foods.
<p></p>
In summary, future FBDGs will likely continue to focus on nutri&shy;ent
adequacy and NCD risk reduction, but may move toward
incorporating new themes of sustain&shy;ability, food skills, and messaging
around highly processed foods. In addition, increased attention to
go beyond careful devel&shy;op&shy;ment of FBDGs to thorough
imple&shy;men&shy;tation and evaluation is also warranted 

<span data-tippy-content="Wijesinha-Bettoni, R., Khosravi, A., Ramos, A. I., Sherman, J., Hernandez-Garbanzo, Y., Molina, V., Vargas, M., & Hachem, F.. (2021). A snapshot of food-based dietary guide&shy;lines imple&shy;men&shy;tation in selected coun&shy;tries. Global Food Security, 29, 100533.">

Finally, FBDGs will continue to be updated to reflect
new knowledge as well as changes in lifestyles and food supplies.

<h2>8c.2 Assessing diet quality</h2>

This section starts with brief comments on definitions of diet quality, and how 
these have changed over time. We then provide detailed discussion of the various 
ways researchers have measured diet quality, both in high-income 
&ldquo;data-rich&rdquo; settings, and in more resource-constrained settings. As 
noted earlier, our focus is on measurement for popu&shy;lation-level applications.

Numerous metrics (indicators, indices, and scores) have been devel&shy;oped to measure the quality of the diet. See Box&nbsp;8c.2 for comments on vocabulary for metrics. 

<div class="box">
<b>Box&nbsp;8c.2 Metrics, indicators, indices and scores.</b>
<p></p>
&ldquo;Metric&rdquo; is a general term meaning a standard against which something 
is evaluated. Other similar terms include &ldquo;indicator&rdquo; 
or &ldquo;index&rdquo; &mdash; indicators are some&shy;times thought of as simple and 
reflecting only one dimension, and indices as composites summarizing across 
multiple dimensions. However, these terms are used differently by different 
authors. Metrics discussed in this section may be called indicators, indices, or 
scores. We use the name used by the authors who first devel&shy;oped or reported on 
the metric. Since many of the most common diet quality metrics are called 
an &ldquo;index&rdquo;, we generally 
use &ldquo;index&rdquo; or &ldquo;indices&rdquo;.
</div>

Some indices are based on national FBDGs but others are not, and have a different 
rationale. For recent reviews of diet quality indices, see:

The section covers:

<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>How the definition of diet quality has changed over time
<li>The basis, or rationale for various diet quality indices
<li>Uses of diet quality indices
<li>The development process for diet quality indices
<li>Detailed examples of different types of diet quality indices
</ul>

By providing detailed examples of diet quality indices, we aim to illustrate 
their variety and uses. The section closes with a brief discussion of new efforts 
to incorporate the idea of envi&shy;ron&shy;mental sustain&shy;ability into diet quality 
definitions and indices.

<h3> 8c.2.1 Changing definitions of diet quality</h3>

Diet quality indices have evolved along with changing definitions of diet quality 
(see Box&nbsp;8c.3). Early indices such as 
the &ldquo;Mean Adequacy Ratio&rdquo; 

<span data-tippy-content="Guthrie, H. A., Madden, J. P., Yoder, M. D., & Koontz, H. P. (1972). Effects of USDA commodity distribution program on nutritive intake. Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 61(3), 287&ndash;292.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5050332"
target="right" >Guthrie et&nbsp;al., 1972</a>)</span>

aimed to summarize nutri&shy;ent adequacy only. Newer diet quality indices often aim 
to reflect multiple char&shy;act&shy;eristics of diets. Many indices aim to reflect both 
nutri&shy;ent adequacy and char&shy;act&shy;eristics of diets related to NCD risk. Currently, 
efforts are underway to also incorporate sustain&shy;ability concerns.

<div class="box">
<b>Box&nbsp;8c.3 Evolution of diet quality definitions</b>
<p></p>
Historically, ideas about diet quality were a response to deprivation, whether 
due to poverty or the demands of wartime economies. Healthy and high-quality 
diets were defined as those that were sufficient: first in calories and protein, 
and later in vitamins and minerals. Fruits, vegetables, and animal-source foods 
(dairy, meat, fish and eggs) were considered &ldquo;protective&rdquo; 
against deficiencies 
(see 
<span data-tippy-content="Harper, A. E. (1987). Evolution of recommended dietary allowances--new directions?. Annual review of nutrition, 7, 509&mdash;537.">
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3300745"
target="right" >Harper, 1987</a></span>
for a history of dietary guidance). 
<p></p>
However, as the food supply and food con&shy;sump&shy;tion patterns changed in many parts 
of the world, the second half of the 20th century brought new concerns and new 
diet quality concepts. Relationships between dietary patterns and 
non-communicable disease (NCD) risk were illuminated, and a large body of 
evidence emerged regarding a different type of &ldquo;protective&rdquo;  diet, one protective 
against NCDs 

<span data-tippy-content="Mozaffarian, D., Rosenberg, I., & Uauy, R. (2018). History of modern nutrition science-implications for current research, dietary guide&shy;lines, and food policy. s. BMJ (Clinical research ed.), 361, k2392. ">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899124"
target="right" >Mozaffarian, Rosenberg, and Uauy, 2018</a>)</span>
<p></p>
Evidence of benefit accumulated for partic&shy;ular regional diets, which could be 
adapted to suit other settings (for example, the Mediterranean 
and &ldquo;alternate&rdquo; Mediterranean patterns), for diets designed to reduce 
hyper&shy;tension (for example, the &ldquo;Dietary Approaches to 
Stop Hyper&shy;tension&rdquo; (DASH) diet) and others 
focused on NCD risk reduction more broadly. 
<p></p>
Other specific recent concerns related to diet quality include the inflammatory 
effects of dietary com&shy;po&shy;nents and consequent NCD risk

<span data-tippy-content="Shivappa, N., Steck, S. E., Hurley, T. G., 
Hussey, J. R., & H&eacute;bert, J. R. (2014). Designing and developing a 
literature-derived, popu&shy;lation-based dietary inflammatory index. Public health 
nutrition, 17(8), 1689&ndash;1696.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23941862"
target="right" >Shivappa et&nbsp;al., 2014</a>)</span>

and the impact of ultra-processed foods on nutri&shy;ent intakes and health risks 

<span data-tippy-content="Elizabeth, L., Machado, P., Zin&ouml;cker, M., Baker, P., & 
Lawrence, M. (2020). Ultra-Processed Foods and Health Outcomes: A Narrative 
Review. Nutrients, 12(7), 1955. ">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32630022"
target="right" >Elizabeth et&nbsp;al., 2020</a>).</span>

Food safety risks are not new but continue as a concern in all contexts. Beyond 
human health effects, there is increasing recognition of the effect of diets and 
food systems on planetary health, and these concerns are now incorporated in some 
definitions of diet quality

<span data-tippy-content="FAO and WHO. (2019). “Sustainable Healthy Diets &ndash; Guiding Principles.” Rome.">
(<a href="http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/ca6640en/"
target="right" >FAO & WHO, 2019</a>).</span>
<p></p>
Global concerns thus now include sufficiency/adequacy, NCD risk reduction, food safety, and sustain&shy;ability, and these concerns are relevant in all coun&shy;tries

</div>

<h3>8c.2.2   Basis for diet quality indices</h3>

Indices used for assessing diet quality may be based on national or
global dietary guide&shy;lines, or they may be based on other
assess&shy;ments of evidence related to nutritional adequacy, diet-health 
relationships, and/or environmental sustainability. Depending on
the underlying definition of diet quality as well as on intended uses,
diet quality indices may be designed to capture one, several, or all of
the following char&shy;act&shy;eristics of diets:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Food groups consumed: Quantities, diversity between
and/or within food groups, and/or balance (pro&shy;por&shy;tionality)
among food groups;
<li>Macronutri&shy;ent balance (for example, percent of energy from
protein, carbo&shy;hydrates and fat);
<li>Nutrient density of the diet (for example, nutri&shy;ents per 1000kcals);
<li>Nutrient adequacy of the diet relative to require&shy;ments;
<li>Moderation in con&shy;sump&shy;tion of foods and food groups that
elevate NCD risk;
<li>Adherence to dietary patterns designed to minimize risk of
NCDs;
<li>Adherence to defined healthy cultural dietary patterns;
<li>Environmental impact and/or sustain&shy;ability of the diet;
<li>Adherence to dietary guidance from national or global
health authorities, such as national FBDGs or World Health
Organization (WHO) guidance.
</li></ul>

There is much overlap among these char&shy;act&shy;eristics. For example,
measures of adherence to healthy cultural dietary patterns may
capture food group diversity, pro&shy;por&shy;tionality, macronutri&shy;ent
balance, nutri&shy;ent adequacy and NCD risk reduction. Examples
include indices for regional diets such as Mediterranean diets

<span data-tippy-content="D'Alessandro, A., & De Pergola, G. (2018). The Mediterranean Diet: its definition and evaluation of a priori dietary indexes in primary cardiovascular prevention. International journal of food sciences and nutrition, 69(6), 647&ndash;659.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29347867"
target="right" >D'Alessandro & De Pergola, 2018</a>)</span>

 and &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; Mediterranean
diets 

<span data-tippy-content="Fung, T. T., Hu, F. B., McCullough, M. L., Newby, P. K., Willett, W. C., & Holmes, M. D. (2006). Diet quality is associated with the risk of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The Journal of nutrition, 136(2), 466&ndash;472.">

 and Nordic diets

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685309"
target="right" >Hillesund et&nbsp;al., 2014</a>).</span>

<p></p>
As noted above, national FBDGs also generally have multiple
objectives, including ensuring nutri&shy;ent adequacy and reducing NCD
risks. Increasingly, as noted in Section&nbsp;8c.1, FBDGs may also aim to
address envi&shy;ron&shy;mental impacts of diets 

<span data-tippy-content="Gonzalez Fischer, C. & Garnett, T. (2016). Plates, Pyramids, and Planets: Developments in National Healthy and Sustainable Dietary Guidelines:A State of Play Assessment. Rome: FAO.">
(<a href="http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/d8dfeaf1-f859-4191-954f-e8e1388cd0b7/"
target="right" >Gonzalez Fischer & Garnett, 2016</a>)</span>

 and/or to specifically advise moderation in
con&shy;sump&shy;tion of certain types of highly processed food 

<span data-tippy-content="Ministry of Health of Brazil. (2014). Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population. Brasilia: Ministry of Health of Brazil.">
(<a href="http://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-based-dietary-guide&shy;lines/regions/coun&shy;tries/brazil/en/"
target="right" >Ministry of Health of Brazil, 2014</a>;</span>
 
 <span data-tippy-content="Canada's dietary guide&shy;lines for 
 health profes&shy;sionals and policy makers . ">
<a href="https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.852216/publication.html"
target="right" >Health Canada, 2019</a></span>).

<p></p>
Thus, diet quality indices designed to reflect adherence to national
or global guide&shy;lines will reflect the definitions of diet quality and the
diverse aspects of diets and dietary patterns that are described in
the partic&shy;ular guide&shy;lines.

<h3>8c.2.3   Uses of diet quality indices</h3>

Diet quality indices have been devel&shy;oped and used for a variety of
purposes, including:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Assessment and monitoring
<ul>
<li class="circle">Describing diet quality for an individual
<li class="circle">Describing diet quality among a popu&shy;lation
<li class="circle">Estimating distributions of diet quality among a popu&shy;lation
<li class="circle">Describing trends in popu&shy;lation diet quality over time
</ul>
<li>Epidemiological research
<ul>
<li class="circle">Examining associ&shy;ations between diet quality and a
dependent variable (for example, does adherence to
a dietary pattern reduce risk of a partic&shy;ular NCD?)
<li class="circle">Examining associ&shy;ations between an independent
variable and diet quality (for example, do lower
income groups have lower diet quality?)
</ul>
<li>Programmatic and policy uses
<ul>
<li class="circle">Targeting programs
<li class="circle">Assessing the effects of policy and programmatic
inter&shy;ventions on diet quality
<li class="circle">Advocacy and informing policy devel&shy;op&shy;ment
</ul></ul>
Just as with nutri&shy;ent intake assess&shy;ment (Chapter&nbsp;8b), diet quality
assess&shy;ment often requires accounting for day-to-day variation in
intakes. See Sections 3.3 and 8a.2.1 for discussions of appropriate dietary measurement and analytic methods for various objectives. 
<p></p>
Certain char&shy;act&shy;eristics of indices may be more or less important
depending on intended uses. For example, when an index will be
used to compare diet quality across coun&shy;tries (or across regions or
cultures within coun&shy;tries), the index should have the same meaning
across diverse cultural dietary patterns 

<span data-tippy-content="Frongillo, E. A., Baranowski, T., Subar, A. F., Tooze, J. A., & Kirkpatrick, S. I. (2019). Establishing Validity and Cross-Context Equivalence of Measures and Indicators. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 119(11), 1817&ndash;1830.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30470590"
target="right" >Frongillo et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>).</span>
<p></p>
In some contexts, when an index is needed for frequent monitoring
of trends (for example, annually or biannually), lower cost, lower
burden indices may be required due to resource constraints.
When an index will be used to summarize diet quality for the
purposes of communi&shy;cating or advocating with non-technical
audiences (whether consumers or policymakers) the index should be
amenable to simple, clear presentation and inter&shy;pretation.
Finally, for most uses, and partic&shy;ularly for use in assessing trends
and in evaluating impacts of policy and programmatic inter&shy;ventions,
indices should be responsive &mdash; that is, they should change in
response to meaningful changes in diet quality.

<h3>8c.2.4    Development of diet quality indices</h3>

There are two general approaches to assessing dietary patterns of
individuals, and to devel&shy;op&shy;ment of indices. One approach assesses
the diet relative to a pre-defined set of criteria (&ldquo;<i>a priori</i>&rdquo; 
dietary patterns) such as national or global recom&shy;mendations, or a defined
cultural dietary pattern.
<p></p>
The second general approach (&ldquo;<i>a posteriori</i>&rdquo; dietary patterns,
some&shy;times called &ldquo;exploratory&rdquo;) is data driven, involving the
examination of clustering of diet char&shy;act&shy;eristics in a partic&shy;ular study
sample 

<span data-tippy-content="Gleason, P. M., Boushey, C. J., Harris, J. E., & Zoellner, J. (2015). Publishing nutrition research: a review of multivariate techniques--part 3: data reduction methods. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 115(7), 1072&ndash;1082.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25935571"
target="right" >Gleason et&nbsp;al., 2015</a>).</span>

There are several analytic approaches
to defining a data-driven dietary pattern, including factor analysis,
principal com&shy;po&shy;nents analysis, and cluster analysis. Reduced rank
regression is a hybrid approach, with a priori identification of
char&shy;act&shy;eristics combined with data-driven identification of patterns.
Because data-driven dietary patterns are difficult to generalize
beyond a partic&shy;ular study setting, they are not further discussed in
this section.
<p></p>
For <i>a priori</i> dietary patterns, selection of index com&shy;po&shy;nents (foods,
nutri&shy;ents, etc.) and quantitative criteria for intakes may be 
well-defined (for example, based on guide&shy;lines), but there are still many
decisions to be taken during devel&shy;op&shy;ment of indices (Box&nbsp;8c.4). In the
next Section, many of these decisions will be illustrated with a
detailed example describing devel&shy;op&shy;ment of the 
U.S.&nbsp;&ldquo;Healthy Eating
Index&rdquo; (HEI), which measures adherence to the U.S. dietary guide&shy;lines.

<li>Should it include food items, food groups, nutri&shy;ents, and/or
food substances such as dietary fiber, polyphenols, or sugar?
</ul>
When com&shy;po&shy;nents are food groups, how are they defined? For example:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Should potatoes or legumes &ldquo;count&rdquo; as vegetables?
<li>Should juice &ldquo;count&rdquo; as fruit?
<li>Should snails or insects &ldquo;count&rdquo; as &ldquo;meat&rdquo;?
</ul>
Are energy intakes accounted for, to distinguish the impact of quantity of food from quality? If so, how? For example:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Should food group intakes be &ldquo;counted&rdquo; in absolute terms, such as in grams? Or should food group intakes be counted in relative terms (for example, grams per&nbsp;1000kcals of total intake)?
</ul>
How are com&shy;po&shy;nents scored?  For example:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Is scoring based on absolute criteria, or on relative
criteria, such as study-specific distributions of intake
for each com&shy;po&shy;nent?
<li>Does scoring differ for different age/sex groups, or other groupings?
<li>How many&nbsp;points per com&shy;po&shy;nent?
<li>For scoring based on criteria (not distributions),
should scoring be:
<ul>
<li class="circle">Dichotomous (1 point if the
criterion is achieved, and 0&nbsp;points if not)? 
<li class="circle">Proportional (ranging from lowest score
to highest depending on how closely intake adheres
to the criterion or recom&shy;mendation)?
<li class="circle">Scored in some other way?
</ul>
</ul>
How are com&shy;po&shy;nents weighted? How are sub-indices weighted? For example:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Should all com&shy;po&shy;nents be given the same &ldquo;weight&rdquo; in
the total score? Or should some com&shy;po&shy;nents be
given heavier &ldquo;weight&rdquo; based on knowledge of
associ&shy;ations to benefits or risks?
<li>For indices with both &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;moderation&rdquo;
com&shy;po&shy;nents, how should the total score for the set
of all adequacy com&shy;po&shy;nents be weighted relative to
the total score for the set of moderation
com&shy;po&shy;nents?
</ul>
</div>

Both during devel&shy;op&shy;ment of indices and afterwards, performance is
evaluated in several ways. Indices should be valid and reliable and
well-suited for intended uses. Validation of indices aims to answer
the following questions, among others:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Is the index well-grounded in theory?
<li>Does it cover all dimensions / char&shy;act&shy;eristics of interest
(content validity)?
<li>Does it perform in a way that is consistent with theory
(construct validity)?
</li></ul>

The purpose of this Section is to provide a small set of examples of
diverse types of indices, with differing origins and intended uses.
<p></p>
Most indices have been devel&shy;oped for adult popu&shy;lations, though
they have some&shy;times been adapted for children and adolescents.
Indices devel&shy;oped or adapted for children and adolescents were
recently reviewed by Dalwood et&nbsp;al.

<p></p>
Historically, most diet quality indices were initially devel&shy;oped in
high-income coun&shy;tries and rely on quantitative dietary recall data
from food frequency ques&shy;tion&shy;naires and/or quantitative
24hr recalls for their measurement. These indices also require
avail&shy;ability of detailed and compre&shy;hensive food composition data.
However, several recent initiatives have aimed to develop lower
burden proxy indices measuring one or more diet quality
char&shy;act&shy;eristics, with less costly data require&shy;ments, for use in global
and/or national monitoring.

The U.S.&nbsp;Healthy Eating Index (HEI) has been widely used over several
decades and is very well documented. Information on recom&shy;mended
presentation and inter&shy;pretation is also available. Because of this, we
use the HEI as a detailed example. Examples of other indices follow
but are described in less detail.

<h3>8c.3.1 Basis, devel&shy;op&shy;ment, and scoring of the U.S.&nbsp;Healthy Eating Index</h3>

The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was designed to reflect adherence to
the U.S. national dietary guide&shy;lines, which apply to all individuals
&ge;&nbsp;2y. The dietary guide&shy;lines are intended both to
ensure nutri&shy;ent adequacy and to reduce risks of NCDs, and hence
the HEI also reflects both adequacy and NCD risk reduction. The HEI
can be used to characterize diets of children &ge;&nbsp;2y
as well as adults.
<p></p>
The US dietary guide&shy;lines are updated every five years. The HEI was
first published in 1995

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7560680"
target="right" >Kennedy et&nbsp;al., 1995</a>),</span>

and was updated in
2005, 2010 and 2015 to reflect new and revised guidance 

<span data-tippy-content="Krebs-Smith, S. M., Pannucci, T. E., Subar, A. F., Kirkpatrick, S. I., Lerman, J. L., Tooze, J. A., Wilson, M. M., & Reedy, J. (2018). Update of the Healthy Eating Index: HEI-2015. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 118(9), 1591&ndash;1602.">

target="right" >Krebs-Smith et&nbsp;al., 2018</a>);</span>
the HEI will be updated again in 2022.
<p></p>
The HEI can be calculated using data from quantitative 24hr
recalls, food records, or food frequency ques&shy;tion&shy;naires. The
appropriate method of calculation depends on the data type and on
intended uses. For most uses, the HEI should be calculated based on
usual dietary intake (i.e., accounting for day-to-day variability in
intakes)

<p></p>
The original HEI included 10 com&shy;po&shy;nents: five food groups reflecting
adequacy, four nutri&shy;ents reflecting moderation, and a measure of
variety in food intake. Each com&shy;po&shy;nent was scored from 0&nbsp;to&nbsp;10,
with adequacy com&shy;po&shy;nents (food group scores) based on total
intake, yielding a total possible score of&nbsp;100. 

<a href="#table8c.2">Table&nbsp;8c.2</a>

shows scoring
for the newer HEI&#8209;2015, which includes nine adequacy com&shy;po&shy;nents,

The scoring for the HEI illustrates some of the many decisions made
during devel&shy;op&shy;ment of diet quality indices more generally. These
include:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Nature of com&shy;po&shy;nent parts (for example, food groups,
nutri&shy;ents, or both);
<li>Operational definition of what food items &ldquo;count&rdquo; for each
com&shy;po&shy;nent.
<li>Decision on how to account for energy intakes;
<li>Criteria for scoring of each com&shy;po&shy;nent, including quantity of
intake for maximum score;
<li>Relative scoring of com&shy;po&shy;nents (i.e., weighting), and range
for total score;

describe the rationale for all decisions
taken during devel&shy;op&shy;ment of the HEI&#8209;2015. In brief, selection of
com&shy;po&shy;nent parts reflects key recom&shy;mendations 
in the 2015&ndash;2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans 

<span data-tippy-content=" U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture. 2015&ndash;2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 8th Edition. December 2015">
(<a href="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf"
target="right" >U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015</a>).</span>

Footnotes to Table&nbsp;8c.2 provide some infor&shy;mation on how foods groups are defined and operationalized and additional details are available on the 
<a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/hei/"
target="right" >HEI website</a>.
<p></p>
Except for the first (1995) version, HEI scoring has been 
based on amounts per&nbsp;1000kcal (i.e., density), 
rather than on total amounts. One
rationale for use of the density approach is that the HEI can then be
applied at different levels (individuals, groups of people, food
envi&shy;ron&shy;ments, food supply).
<p></p>
The density approach also has the effect of minimizing (though not
eliminating) differences in food group quantity recom&shy;mendations
across differing energy intake levels (which in turn correspond to
differences in age, size and activity level). To allow for consistent
scoring, the HEI takes the least restrictive (easiest to achieve) target
for density of intakes for energy intake levels ranging from 1200&ndash;2400kcal. 
<p></p>
For most adequacy com&shy;po&shy;nents (food groups), the maximum score is
given for intake at or above the target density, and a minimum score
of &ldquo;0&rdquo; is given for no intake. For fatty acid adequacy, and for the
moderation com&shy;po&shy;nents, the rationale for minimum and maximum
scores is somewhat more complex (see  

<span data-tippy-content="Krebs-Smith, S. M., Pannucci, T. E., Subar, A. F., Kirkpatrick, S. I., Lerman, J. L., Tooze, J. A., Wilson, M. M., & Reedy, J. (2018). Update of the Healthy Eating Index: HEI-2015. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 118(9), 1591&ndash;1602.">
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30146071"
target="right" >Krebs-Smith et&nbsp;al., 2018</a></span>

for details).  
<p></p>
For all com&shy;po&shy;nents, densities between the minimum and maximum 
standards are scored pro&shy;por&shy;tionally. For example, 
consuming no whole grains is scored at zero, and consuming 1.5&nbsp;ounces 
of whole grains per&nbsp;1000kcals is scored at the maximum of 10&nbsp; points. 
Consuming 0.75&nbsp;ounces per&nbsp;1000kcals is scored at 5&nbsp;points 
since it is halfway from zero to the target density.
<p></p>
While the HEI&#8209;2015 has more &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo; 
com&shy;po&shy;nents than the original HEI (9&nbsp;vs.5), the original total
score of 100 is maintained. Certain original food groups 
are sub-divided: for example, the original HEI
awarded up to 10&nbsp;points for vegetables, 
whereas HEI&#8209;2015 awards 5&nbsp;points 
for &ldquo;greens and beans&rdquo; and
an additional 5&nbsp;points for &ldquo;total vegetables&rdquo;.
<p></p>
Considering the five broader food groups (vs. subgroups, 
that is: fruits; vegetables; whole grains; dairy; and
protein foods), each is equally weighted in 
HEI&#8209;2015, with a maximum score of 10&nbsp;points. Fatty
acids and each of the 4&nbsp;moderation com&shy;po&shy;nents 
also have maximum scores of 10&nbsp;points. Overall, the
adequacy com&shy;po&shy;nents total 60&nbsp;of&nbsp;the 100&nbsp;points, 
whereas the moderation com&shy;po&shy;nents total 40 of the
100&nbsp;points.
<p></p>
The rationale for equal weighting of com&shy;po&shy;nents 
is that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are
meant to be considered as a whole and that all 
concepts are equally important; further, there is
currently no evidence to support unequal 
weighting 

<span data-tippy-content="Krebs-Smith, S. M., Pannucci, T. E., Subar, A. F., Kirkpatrick, S. I., Lerman, J. L., Tooze, J. A., Wilson, M. M., & Reedy, J. (2018). Update of the Healthy Eating Index: HEI-2015. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 118(9), 1591&ndash;1602.">

Equal weighting of com&shy;po&shy;nents is a feature of many other 
diet quality indices, and for the same reasons.

report on construct and 
criterion-related validity. Construct validity was assessed in
several ways. &ldquo;Exemplary menus&rdquo; were shown to receive high 
HEI&#8209;2015 scores; scores in a nationally
representative sample demonstrated sufficient variation 
(range from the 1<sup>st</sup>&ndash;99<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;percentile was from 33&nbsp;to
81&nbsp;points) and scores were significantly 
different between smokers and non-smokers, as 
expected <i>a&nbsp;priori.</i> Scores were independent of energy intakes, i.e.,
reflective of quality, rather than quantity of intakes.
<p></p>
Criterion-related validity was demonstrated 
in a prospective cohort, where the highest vs the lowest
quintiles of the HEI&#8209;2015 scores were associated 
with a decreased risk of all cause, cancer, and
cardiovascular disease mortality. 
In addition, scores for previous versions of the HEI have been shown to be
associated with reduced 
risks of NCDs and mortality in numerous 
studies (see, for example,

can be used to visualize popu&shy;lation-level 
dietary patterns. In the radar graph, each com&shy;po&shy;nent 
score is plotted as a percent of maximum
points, on an axis. The perimeter illustrates 
a perfect score. Radar graphs are also useful because they
show how the same total score can 
represent different patterns (sets of com&shy;po&shy;nent scores).
<p></p>
To qualitatively describe popu&shy;lation-level scores, 
a graded approach can be used, with 90 to 100&nbsp;points
an &ldquo;A&rdquo;, 80&nbsp;to&nbsp;89 a &ldquo;B&rdquo;, etc. Similarly, each 
com&shy;po&shy;nent score can be graded 

<span data-tippy-content="Krebs-Smith, S. M., Pannucci, T. E., Subar, A. F., Kirkpatrick, S. I., Lerman, J. L., Tooze, J. A., Wilson, M. M., & Reedy, J. (2018). Update of the Healthy Eating Index: HEI-2015. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 118(9), 1591&ndash;1602.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30146071"
target="right" >Krebs-Smith et&nbsp;al., 2018</a>).</span>

However, categorized scores (translated into &ldquo;grades&rdquo;) 
should not be used for analysis purposes as categorization results 
in loss of infor&shy;mation and may result in misclassification.
<p></p>
To interpret the magnitude of a difference 
in scores between groups, or across time in the same
popu&shy;lation, a difference (or change) of 5&ndash;6&nbsp;points 
was shown to represent a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; effect size for
the U.S. popu&shy;lation 

<span data-tippy-content="Kirkpatrick, S. I., Reedy, J., Krebs-Smith, S. M., Pannucci, T. E., Subar, A. F., Wilson, M. M., Lerman, J. L., & Tooze, J. A. (2018).

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30146072"
target="right" >Kirkpatrick et&nbsp;al., 2018</a>).</span>

However, the authors caution that this may not apply to
other popu&shy;lations, since effect sizes are calculated 
in relation to the typical dispersion of scores
(standard deviations), which may vary across popu&shy;lations.
<p></p>
More generally, the radar graph or 
graded approach could be used for descriptive purposes with a
variety of multi-com&shy;po&shy;nent diet quality indices. 
Determining meaningful differences could similarly be
informed by examination of standard deviations of the 
score in the popu&shy;lation of interest, ideally in
multiple studies. A difference (or change) 
in scores of approx&shy;imately one&#8209;half of a standard deviation is
considered to be a moderate effect size

<h3>8c.3.4 Adaptation of the Healthy Eating Index concept</h3>

In addition to the periodic updates related to updated 
U.S.&nbsp;dietary guide&shy;lines, the HEI concept has also
been adapted for other contexts.

<h3>8c.4 Alternate Healthy Eating Index</h3>

While the HEI and similar indices in other coun&shy;tries 
measure adherence to current national dietary
guide&shy;lines, another very widely used index, the &ldquo;Alternate 
Healthy Eating Index&rdquo; (AHEI), was devel&shy;oped
to reflect additional evidence related to NCDs, 
which had not been incorporated in the US&nbsp;national
guidance at the time.

As first devel&shy;oped by McCullough et&nbsp;al. 

<span data-tippy-content="McCullough, M. L., Feskanich, D., Stampfer, M. J., Giovannucci, E. L., Rimm, E. B., Hu, F. B., Spiegelman, D., Hunter, D. J., Colditz, G. A., & Willett, W. C. (2002).

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12450892"
target="right" >2002</a>),</span>

the AHEI incorporated some of the same elements as
the original HEI, but in addition emphasized: 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion of whole grains; a favorable ratio of fish and
poultry to red and processed meats; 
intake of nuts and soy foods; and a favorable ratio of
polyunsaturated to saturated fats. Unlike 
the HEI, dairy is not included in the scoring. The AHEI showed
stronger associ&shy;ations than the original HEI to 
cardiovascular disease out&shy;comes for both men

<br/><sup>d</sup> Use of grams of whole grains accounts for the variability of the 
percentages of whole grain in various. One serving of a 100% whole-grain product 
(i.e., 0.5cup of oatmeal or brown rice) contains &asymp;&nbsp;15&ndash;20g of 
whole grains (per dry weight).
<br/><sup>e</sup> One serving is 8oz.
<br/><sup>f</sup> One serving is 1oz of nuts or 1&nbsp;tablespoon (15mL) of 
peanut butter.
<br/><sup>g</sup> One serving is 4oz of unprocessed meat or 1.5oz of 
processed meat.
<br/><sup>h</sup> Optimal intake (250mg/d) is &asymp;&nbsp;two 4oz servings of fish per week.
<br/><sup>i</sup> Cutoffs for sodium were based on deciles of distribution in the 
data sets used to develop the index. This was due to lack of brand specificity on 
the food frequency ques&shy;tion&shy;naires, 
such that absolute intakes could not be
accurately estimated. This implies users would also base cutoffs on deciles of 
distribution in the data set analyzed.
<br/><sup>j</sup> Highest scores are for moderate alcohol intake, and the worst score is for heavy con&shy;sump&shy;tion. Nondrinkers receive an inter&shy;mediate score of 2.5.

Like the HEI, the AHEI was later revised to reflect 
new epidemi&shy;ological evidence on relation&shy;ships of
dietary com&shy;po&shy;nents to NCD risks, and the newer 
version is referred to as the AHEI&nbsp;2010 

<span data-tippy-content="Chiuve, S. E., Fung, T. T., Rimm, E. B., Hu, F. B., McCullough, M. L., Wang, M., Stampfer, M. J., & Willett, W. C. (2012). Alternative dietary indices both strongly predict risk of chronic disease. The Journal of nutrition, 142(6), 1009&ndash;1018.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22513989"
target="right" >Chiuve et&nbsp;al., 2012</a>).</span>

As in the original version, the 
rationale for the AHEI&nbsp;2010 was a compre&shy;hensive review of
clinical and epidemi&shy;ological research 
by the authors, with selection and scoring of com&shy;po&shy;nents that
were deemed to be consistently associated 
with NCD risk. As with the original, the AHEI&nbsp;2010 did not
fully align with the HEI.
<p></p>
Scoring for the AHEI 2010 is shown in
<a href="#table8c.3">Table&nbsp;8c.3</a>.
<a id="table8c.3"></a>
Both versions of the AHEI were devel&shy;oped 
using semi-quantitative food frequency 
data from prospective cohort studies of U.S.&nbsp;health profes&shy;sionals.
However, subsequent users have also calculated scores for
the AHEI from quantitative 24hr&nbsp;recall data and for
other popu&shy;lation groups, including 
adolescents (see, for example 

<span data-tippy-content="Dalwood, P., Marshall, S., Burrows, T. L., McIntosh, A., & Collins, C. E. (2020). Diet quality indices and their associ&shy;ations with health-related out&shy;comes in children and adolescents: an updated systematic review. Nutrition journal, 19(1), 118.">

 however, 
Dalwood et&nbsp;al. caution against application of indices devel&shy;oped for adults
in pediatric popu&shy;lations.
<p></p>
Like the HEI, the AHEI includes both foods and 
nutri&shy;ents (fatty acids) among the com&shy;po&shy;nent parts, but
it also includes sweet beverages and alcohol. 
Unlike the HEI, the AHEI is not scored based on densities
(quan&shy;tities per 1000kcal), but instead based on total 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion per day. Unlike in the HEI,
fruit juice is included with sugar-sweetened 
beverages rather than with fruit.
<p></p>
Highest scores are based on literature-based 
judgments of minimum risk. Consistent with the HEI, intakes that
are inter&shy;mediate between the minimum and maximum are generally scored 
pro&shy;por&shy;tionally. However,
alcohol has &ldquo;U-shaped&rdquo; scoring, 
such that the highest score is given for moderate intake and lower
scores for &ldquo;0&rdquo; or for excessive intake. 
Sodium intakes are scored based on the study specific
distribution. Also as for the HEI, com&shy;po&shy;nents each 
have a maximum of 10&nbsp;points, in this case yielding a
range of up to 110&nbsp;points (11&nbsp;com&shy;po&shy;nents), 
with 6&nbsp;&ldquo;positive&rdquo; 
com&shy;po&shy;nents, 4&nbsp;&ldquo;negative&rdquo; com&shy;po&shy;nents
and alcohol (U-shaped).

<h3>8c.5    Mediterranean Diet Score or Index</h3>

Evidence on the healthfulness of various Mediterranean 
regional diets has been accumu&shy;lating since 
the mid&#8209;20<sup>th</sup> century 

<span data-tippy-content="Menotti, A., & Puddu, P. E. (2015). How the Seven Countries Study contributed to the definition and devel&shy;op&shy;ment of the Mediterranean diet concept: a 50-year journey. Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD, 25(3), 245&ndash;252.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25650160"
target="right" >Menotti & Puddu, 2015</a>).</span>

Generally, Mediterranean diets are characterized by a
high intake of plant-based foods including 
olive oil, fruit, nuts, vegetables, and cereals; a moderate
intake of fish and poultry; a low intake of dairy products, red meat, processed 
meats, and sweets; and
a moderate amount of wine. However, unlike the dietary patterns captured by the 
HEI and AHEI, which
each have a single definition, there are numerous Mediterranean diets and 
numerous scores and
indices (see: 

<span data-tippy-content="Mil&agrave;-Villarroel, R., Bach-Faig, A., Puig, J., Puchal, A., Farran, A., Serra-Majem, L., & Carrasco, J. L. (2011). Comparison and evaluation of the reliability of indexes of adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Public health nutrition, 14(12A), 2338&ndash;2345.">

<p></p>
In contrast to the HEI and AHEI, Mediterranean Diet Scores (MDSs) are 
generally based on foods and
beverages only, rather than on a mix of foods/beverages 
and nutri&shy;ents. Intended uses of MDSs are not consistently
clearly stated in papers reporting on their devel&shy;op&shy;ment. 
They are frequently used in epidemi&shy;ological studies 
investigating associ&shy;ations of diets to morbidity and mortality. MDSs vary 
widely in their scoring
range (for example, possible scores of 0&ndash;8 vs. 0&ndash;100) and in the 
rationale and method of scoring, as
illustrated in the following examples.

<h3>8c.5.1 Mediterranean Diet Score of Trichopoulou</h3>

MDSs with the narrowest ranges are scored as &ldquo;yes&rdquo; (1) 
or &ldquo;no&rdquo;  (0) for a small set of food groups. Trichopoulou et&nbsp;al. 

<span data-tippy-content="Trichopoulou, A., Kouris-Blazos, A., Wahlqvist, M. L., Gnardellis, C., Lagiou, P., Polychronopoulos, E., Vassilakou, T., Lipworth, L., & Trichopoulos, D. (1995). Diet and overall survival in elderly people. BMJ (Clinical research ed.), 311(7018), 1457&ndash;1460.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8520331"
target="right" >1995</a>)</span>

devel&shy;oped one of the first MDS and demonstrated an
associ&shy;ation with mortality in a Greek popu&shy;lation. The original analysis was based 
on semi-quantitative food frequency
data from adults over 70y. This MDS was designed for an
epidemi&shy;ological study.   The MDS of Trichopoulou et&nbsp;al. 
is an 8-point score, assessing for the following:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>High con&shy;sump&shy;tion of legumes
<li>High con&shy;sump&shy;tion of cereals (including bread and potatoes)
<li>High con&shy;sump&shy;tion of fruits
<li>High con&shy;sump&shy;tion of vegetables
<li>Low con&shy;sump&shy;tion of meat and meat products
<li>Low con&shy;sump&shy;tion of milk and dairy products
<li>High ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat
<li>Moderate alcohol con&shy;sump&shy;tion
</li>
</ul>
This score has 5&nbsp;&ldquo;positive&rdquo; 2&nbsp;&ldquo;negative&rdquo; 
and one &ldquo;U&#8209;shaped&rdquo; com&shy;po&shy;nent like the AHEI, for moderate
alcohol intake. Dairy is included as a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; com&shy;po&shy;nent; this is 
typical of many MDSs.
&ldquo;High&rdquo; intake was defined as intake above the sex-specific median 
quantity consumed by their study subjects rather 
than in relation to a set of recom&shy;mended intakes, and therefore 
scoring for this MDS is
dependent on study-specific distributions of intake. This approach to scoring is 
useful for study-specific
comparisons but less useful for comparing across 
contexts. Several other MDSs are scored in this way.

<h3>8c.5.2 &ldquo;MedDietScore&rdquo; of Panagiotakos</h3>

For a prospective cohort study of adults in Athens, 
Panagiotakos et&nbsp;al. 

<span data-tippy-content="Panagiotakos, D. B., Pitsavos, C., Arvaniti, F., & Stefanadis, C. (2007).

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17350085"
target="right" >2007</a>)</span>

devel&shy;oped a 55&#8209;point
&ldquo;MedDietScore&rdquo; where scoring did not depend on the distribution of 
intake among study subjects.
Instead, each com&shy;po&shy;nent was scored from 0&ndash;5 
based on respon&shy;dent report of frequency of
con&shy;sump&shy;tion, based on data from a semi-quantitative 
food frequency ques&shy;tion&shy;naire covering the past year.
<p></p>
Component scores increased with frequency for 7&nbsp;&ldquo;positive&rdquo; 
com&shy;po&shy;nents &mdash; non&#8209;refined cereals, fruits,
vegetables, legumes, olive oil, fish and potatoes &mdash; and 
decreased with frequency for 3&nbsp;&ldquo;negative&rdquo;
com&shy;po&shy;nents &mdash; red meat and products, poultry and full&#8209;fat dairy 
products. As with several other indices,
there were more &ldquo;positive&rdquo; 
com&shy;po&shy;nents than &ldquo;negative&rdquo; com&shy;po&shy;nents.
<p></p>
This MedDietScore was negatively associated 
with hyper&shy;tension, hyper&shy;chol&shy;esterol&shy;emia, diabetes and
obesity in the initial study and was later shown to be negatively 
associated with 10&#8209;year incidence of
cardiovascular disease

Component scoring was based on a set of prospective cohort studies,
published between 2010 and 2013. 
The studies were primarily from Europe and 
included the multi-country European Prospective Investigation into 
Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study as well as additional
studies from some of the EPIC study 
coun&shy;tries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, The
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the UK). 
Several studies were from the U.S., and no studies
were from Asia, Africa, or Latin America. 
All studies included adult participants only.
<p></p>
For each com&shy;po&shy;nent, intakes were categorized 
into three levels after calculating weighted averages
(weighted by study sample size) and standard deviations of 
intakes across all studies. The score includes 
six &ldquo;positive&rdquo; 
com&shy;po&shy;nents, two &ldquo;negative&rdquo;  
com&shy;po&shy;nents, and U-shaped scoring for alcohol.
<p></p>
Construct validity for the MEDI-LITE score 
was demonstrated by comparing it to the previously
validated MedDietScore of Panagiotakos (above).

The MSDPS was explicitly intended for
use in non-Mediterranean popu&shy;lations. During devel&shy;op&shy;ment, 
performance of the MSDPS was assessed
among adults using data from a semi-quantitative food frequency ques&shy;tion&shy;naire 
covering the past year.
<p></p>
The thirteen com&shy;po&shy;nents are each scored from 0&ndash;10, then summed. 
The total score is standardized to&nbsp;100 by
dividing the calculated sum by the theoretical maximum 
sum of&nbsp;130 and multiplying by&nbsp;100. To
account for foods not on the Mediterranean Diet 
Pyramid, the standardized score is weighted by the
pro&shy;por&shy;tion of total energy intake derived from foods 
on the pyramid. For example, if 20% of
kilocalories are from foods not on the pyramid, 
the standardized score is multiplied by 0.8.
<p></p>
As for the HEI and AHEI, intakes that are lower than 
recom&shy;mended are scored pro&shy;portion&shy;ately to the
recom&shy;mended amounts. Scoring is for total quan&shy;tities 
(as for the AHEI) and not for densities (as for the
HEI).
<p></p>
Unlike some other indices, scoring for the 
MSDPS &ldquo;penalizes&rdquo; over&shy;con&shy;sumption of a given food group
by subtracting&nbsp;points in pro&shy;por&shy;tion to the 
amount of excess &mdash; for example, exceeding the
recom&shy;mended intake by 60% would 
result in a score of&nbsp;4 for a given com&shy;po&shy;nent. The lowest possible
score for each com&shy;po&shy;nent is zero. This means, 
for example, that both 2&nbsp;servings of meat/week 
and 10&nbsp;servings of meat/week are scored identically as zero.
<p></p>
Construct validity was demonstrated through 
expected positive associ&shy;ations with intakes of dietary
fiber, fatty acids, antioxidant vitamins, calcium, 
magnesium, and potassium, and inverse associ&shy;ations
with a glycemic index and with intakes of added sugar, 
saturated fat, and <i>trans</i>&#8209;fat.

<h3>8c.5.5 Summary of Mediterranean Diet Scores</h3>

There is no consensus on a single or &ldquo;best&rdquo; 
Mediterranean Diet Score or Index, and this depends on
intended uses; see D’Alessandro and De Pergola

originally devel&shy;oped based on analyses of data from 
adult popu&shy;lations, including elders, MDSs have
been adapted and used in studies of children 
and adolescents

<p></p>
Finally, concerning the potential to adapt the MDS for 
relevance in other regions, there is more experience 
in high-income countries and in the global 
north compared to the global south. The applicability of 
the pattern described by the MDS to some other regions is not established, 
particularly in regions where some of the 
distinctive components (for example, olive oil, red wine, nuts, legumes, and/or 
fish) are not available and/or are not part of cultural dietary patterns.

Mediterranean diet is sufficiently consolidated that it can be

suggestions for its adaptation with foods from other regions.

Box&nbsp;8c.7 summarizes key&nbsp;points about MDSs.

<div class="box">
<b>Box&nbsp;8c.7 Summary of Mediterranean diet scores and indices</b>
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>There are a large number of scores and indices measuring adherence to 
different versions of the Mediterranean diet;
<li>The original scores were devel&shy;oped based on data from older adults, but 
there are many versions adapted for children and adolescents;
<li>MDSs have been adapted for several other regions, but certain char&shy;act&shy;eristic 
foods are not consumed or are rarely consumed in some other global regions;
<li>Component parts are usually food groups; olive oil and 
alcohol are also often included;
<li>Components are usually expressed as quan&shy;tities, not densities;
<li>Most MDSs requires detailed quantitative dietary intake data (grams or 
standard servings consumed);
<li>Most MDSs were developed for use in epidemiological studies, 
but are also appropriate to use in describing diet quality of populations;
<li>Scoring for com&shy;po&shy;nents 
is some&shy;times absolute (based on <i>a priori</i> 
criteria for intakes) but for many MDSs, scoring is not 
absolute and instead is based on distributions of intake in the
study sample (for example, with high&nbsp;points 
given to the highest quartile or quintile of intakes);
<li>Both the complexity of scoring and the balance between positive and negative 
scores vary widely among MDSs.

<h3> 8c.6   Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension scores</h3>

Scores reflecting adherence to the Dietary Approaches to 
Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern
have also been widely used, partic&shy;ularly in studies 
investigating associ&shy;ations between dietary patterns and
NCDs. The original DASH diet and scoring 
were devel&shy;oped for a randomized controlled feeding trial
investigating the impact of a prescribed 
dietary pattern on blood pressure. The trial, initiated in 1994,
compared a typical U.S.&nbsp;dietary pattern to 
one high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products,
that emphasized fish and chicken rather 
than red meat, and was low in saturated fats, choles&shy;terol,
sugars, and refined carbo&shy;hydrate.
<p></p>
The original study demonstrated reductions in 
blood pressure after the 8&#8209;week inter&shy;vention 

<span data-tippy-content="Sacks, F. M., Appel, L. J., Moore, T. J., Obarzanek, E., Vollmer, W. M., Svetkey, L. P., Bray, G. A., Vogt, T. M., Cutler, J. A., Windhauser, M. M., Lin, P.

intake had not been manipulated in the original trial

While the DASH diet was originally devel&shy;oped to lower blood pressure, 
subsequent studies have linked higher adherence to the
DASH diet with lower risks for a range of adverse out&shy;comes, 
including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
disease incidence or mortality, cancer incidence or mortality, 
type&nbsp;2 diabetes, and neuro&shy;degen&shy;erative disease

<p></p>
As for Mediterranean diets, there have been several 
specific scores devel&shy;oped to reflect adherence to
the DASH diet, and DASH scores have also been 
devel&shy;oped for pediatric popu&shy;lations.

shows one commonly used scoring system with 8&nbsp;com&shy;po&shy;nents, 
each worth 5&nbsp;points, for a total of 40&nbsp;points.
The scoring system is based on sex-specific 
quintile rankings within the study popu&shy;lation.
<p></p>
With the exception of sodium, this DASH adherence 
score is based on foods rather than nutri&shy;ents. As
with the HEI, AHEI and MDS above, the eight&nbsp;com&shy;po&shy;nents 
are given equal weight. As with many of the
score described above, there are slightly 
more &ldquo;positive&rdquo; than &ldquo;negative&rdquo; com&shy;po&shy;nents, 
implying an overall heavier weighting of positive 
food groups. Unlike in many MDSs, low-fat dairy is scored
positively.
<p></p>
Like some versions of the MDS, and also like 
some other versions of DASH diet scores, scoring is
dependent on study-specific distributions of intake. 
This type of scoring can maximize contrasts for
studies investigating associ&shy;ations 
between dietary patterns and out&shy;comes. 
However as noted above, it
is less useful for comparing intakes across contexts.

<h3>8c.7   Healthy Diet Indicator</h3>

adherence to U.S. national dietary guidance, the Healthy Diet

To our knowledge, the HDI has not been widely used in studies of children.
<p></p>
Unlike all the previous scores and indices, 
most of the com&shy;po&shy;nents in the HDI are nutri&shy;ents or food
substances rather than food groups. 
This reflects the fact that the WHO 
<a href="
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet"
target="right" >&ldquo;Healthy Diet Fact Sheet&rdquo;</a>
currently gives quantitative guidance for intakes of sugars, 
various types of fatty acids, and salt, but limited guidance
on quantitative intakes of food groups.

<h3>8c.8   Dietary Inflammatory Indices</h3>

Recently, several diet quality indices have been 
devel&shy;oped to capture the inflammatory potential of
the diet

<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30615051"

Such indices were devel&shy;oped in recognition of
the key role of chronic low-grade inflammation in the 
etiology of NCDs, and the role of dietary factors
in chronic inflammation. In this section, we 
describe one widely used index, the Dietary Inflammatory
Index (DII).
<p></p>
The DII was designed for global relevance, 
regardless of the cultural dietary pattern 

<span data-tippy-content="H&eacute;bert, J. R., Shivappa, N., Wirth, M. D., Hussey, J. R., & Hurley, T. G. (2019). Perspective: The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)-Lessons Learned, Improvements Made, and Future Directions. Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.), 10(2), 185&ndash;195.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30615051"
target="right" >Hébert et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>).</span>

The DII is scored primarily based on 
nutri&shy;ents and food substances. Selection of and weighting
of com&shy;po&shy;nents were based on a 
compre&shy;hensive literature review spanning 1950&ndash;2010 and including
studies from diverse popu&shy;lations that assessed 
the relation&shy;ships of nutri&shy;ents, foods, and food
substances to six inflammatory biomarkers

<span data-tippy-content="Cavicchia, P. P., Steck, S. E., Hurley, T. G., Hussey, J. R., Ma, Y., Ockene, I. S., & H&eacute;bert, J. R. (2009).

<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23941862"
target="right" >Shivappa et&nbsp;al., 2014</a>).</span>
<p></p>
The DII has been applied in studies of a wide range of 
NCDs and risk factors. A recent review
documented associ&shy;ations between DII scores and 
certain cancers, cardiovascular disease and its
associated mortality, adverse mental health, 
and musculoskeletal disorders. Evidence on DII and
respiratory health, neurodevel&shy;op&shy;mental 
out&shy;comes, the metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes is
either conflicting or limited to date 

<span data-tippy-content="Phillips, C. M., Chen, L. W., Heude, B., Bernard, J. Y., Harvey, N. C., Duijts, L., Mensink-Bout, S. M., Polanska, K., Mancano, G., Suderman, M., Shivappa, N., & H&eacute;bert, J. R. (2019). Dietary Inflammatory Index and Non-Communicable Disease Risk: A Narrative Review. Nutrients, 11(8), 1873.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408965"
target="right" >Phillips et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>).</span>
<p></p>
Scoring for the DII is based on 45 com&shy;po&shy;nents, 
consisting mainly of macro&#8209; and micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents and
food substances (for example, flavonoids, caffeine) 
but also including several foods, herbs/spices
(garlic, ginger, onion, pepper, rosemary, 
saffron, thyme, and turmeric), and beverages (tea and
alcohol). In the most recent version, scoring cut-offs were 
determined based on associations of components to inflammation in studies from eleven coun&shy;tries in all global regions except Africa.

<span data-tippy-content="Shivappa, N., Steck, S. E., Hurley, T. G., Hussey, J. R., 
& H&eacute;bert, J. R. (2014). Designing and developing a literature-derived, popu&shy;lation-based dietary inflammatory index. Public health nutrition, 17(8), 1689&ndash;1696.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23941862"
target="right" >Shivappa et&nbsp;al., 2014</a>).</span>
<p></p>
Each of the 45 com&shy;po&shy;nents has a score indi&shy;cating its 
pro&#8209; or anti-inflammatory potential, with positive
scores for pro-inflammatory com&shy;po&shy;nents and 
negative scores for anti-inflammatory com&shy;po&shy;nents. The
DII is the sum of the com&shy;po&shy;nent scores. 
Unlike many indices described above, the com&shy;po&shy;nents of the
DII are not equally weighted. The total 
range in seven &ldquo;example scenarios&rdquo; was
from &plus;7.98 (strongly pro-inflammatory) 
to &minus;8.87 (i.e. strongly anti-inflammatory); 
the example scenarios were created by the authors to illustrate various combinations of plausible intakes for the 45 com&shy;po&shy;nents 

<span data-tippy-content="Shivappa, N., Steck, S. E., Hurley, T. G., Hussey, J. R., & 
H&eacute;bert, J. R. (2014). Designing and developing a literature-derived, popu&shy;lation-based dietary inflammatory index. Public health nutrition, 17(8), 1689&ndash;1696.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23941862"
target="right" >Shivappa et&nbsp;al., 2014</a>).</span>

Note that &mdash; unlike other 
indices &mdash; a negative score is better than a positive one.
<p></p>
The DII has been further adapted in a version that adjusts for total energy 
(E-DII) and in a version for children (C-DII), 
validated for children 6&ndash;14y. The C-DII predicted blood concentration of 
one inflammatory marker (C-reactive protein) in children

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061487"

Construction of the DII requires data on all com&shy;po&shy;nents, 
though it has been adapted for use when data for some
com&shy;po&shy;nents are not available

relation&shy;ship between the inflammatory
potential of overall diets and various health out&shy;comes. 
Box&nbsp;8c.9 summarizes key&nbsp;points about the DII.

<h3>8c.9  Diet quality based on level of food processing </h3>

Another recent approach to assess&shy;ment of diet 
quality is based on classification of foods and
beverages according to the level of processing in their production. 
Monteiro et&nbsp;al. 

<span data-tippy-content="Monteiro, C. A., Levy, R. B., Claro, R. M., Castro, I. R., & Cannon, G. (2010). A new classification of foods based on the extent and purpose of their processing. Cadernos de saude publica, 26(11), 2039&ndash;2049.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21180977"
target="right" >2010</a>)</span>

first proposed a system of classification, 
which was subsequently modified to include four groups:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Unprocessed or minimally processed foods;
<li>Processed culinary ingredients;
<li>Processed foods; and
<li>Ultra-processed food and drink products.
</li>
</ul>
The modified classification scheme is referred to as 
the &ldquo;NOVA&rdquo; classification 

<span data-tippy-content="Monteiro, C.A., Cannon G., Levy R., Moubarac J.-C., Jaime P., Martins A.P., Canella D., Louzada M., & Parra D. (2016). NOVA. The Star Shines Bright. World Nutrition 7 (1&ndash;3): 28&ndash;38. ">
(<a href="https://worldnutritionjournal.org/index.php/wn/article/view/5"
target="right" >Monteiro et&nbsp;al., 2016</a>).</span>

Particular attention has been paid to the role of 
ultra-processed products (UPF) in diets. While the
classification is at the level of food and beverage 
items, the quality of the overall diet is then
characterized by the pro&shy;por&shy;tion of UPF in the diet 
(usually, as a percent of total energy)

describe UPF as &ldquo;formulations of low-cost ingredients, 
many of non-culinary use, that result from a sequence of 
industrial processes (hence ultra-processed)&rdquo;.
The identification and classification of UPF have recently been clarified:
<blockquote>
&ldquo;A practical way to identify an ultra-processed product is to 
check to see if its list of ingredients contains at least one item 
charact&shy;eristic of the NOVA ultra-processed food group, which is to
say, either food substances never or rarely used in 
kitchens (such as high-fructose corn syrup,
hydro&shy;genated or inter&shy;esterified oils, and 
hydrolysed proteins), or classes of additives designed
to make the final product palatable or more 
appealing (such as flavours, flavour enhancers,
colours, emulsifiers, emulsifying salts, sweeteners, 
thickeners, and anti-foaming, bulking,
carbonating, foaming, gelling and glazing agents)&rdquo;

target="right" >Monteiro et&nbsp;al., 2019, p. 936</a>).</span>

</blockquote>
Examples of UPF include packaged instant soups and 
noodles, carbonated beverages, reconstituted
meat products, many sweet and savory 
packaged snacks, frozen &ldquo;ready meals&rdquo;, and fast food dishes.
Some UPF provide substantial nutri&shy;ents, either from 
food ingredients (for example, packaged
sweetened yogurts) or from fortification (for example, 
highly processed but fortified breakfast cereals),
leading to challenges on definition of categories, and 
some disagreement on the value of the NOVA
classification

Assessment of the role 
of UPFs in the diet has been undertaken for a wide range of
age groups, beginning in infancy.
<p></p>
A higher pro&shy;por&shy;tion of total intake from UPF 
has been associated with lower intakes of some
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents and higher intakes of sugars, 
salt, and saturated and trans-fatty acids (see for example

<h3>8c.10   Lower-burden diet quality indices</h3>

Most diet quality indices described above require 
quantitative dietary intake data, for example from
food frequency ques&shy;tion&shy;naires, 
quantitative 24hr recalls, or other detailed quantitative
approaches. Obtaining accurate 
quantitative dietary intake data is resource intensive. Because of the
resource require&shy;ments, many low&#8209; and middle-income 
coun&shy;tries do not currently have nationally
representative dietary intake data, and 
even high-income coun&shy;tries may not collect such data
sufficiently frequently to meet all needs, such as for monitoring of 
population-level diet quality trends.
<p></p>
To meet needs for basic infor&shy;mation on intake 
patterns in contexts where quantitative data are not
available, several &ldquo;lower-burden&rdquo;
 approaches have been devel&shy;oped, partic&shy;ularly for use in global and
national monitoring under resource constraints. 
These lower-burden approaches are all food group-
based and/or ask behavioral questions (rather 
than including nutri&shy;ent intakes for their calculation) and
do not require food composition data for tabulation.

<h3>8c.10.1 Global surveillance of dietary behaviors</h3>

Many lower-burden survey tools (often called &ldquo;screeners&rdquo;) 
have been devel&shy;oped to capture only one or
several com&shy;po&shy;nents of intake, and/or dietary habits. 
Examples of screeners devel&shy;oped for global use
are the ques&shy;tion&shy;naires for the WHO Stepwise 
Approach to NCD Surveillance 

<span data-tippy-content="WHO Stepwise 
Approach to NCD Surveillance ">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/ncds/surveillance/steps/en/"
target="right" >STEPS</a>)</span>

<!--https://www.who.int/ncds/surveillance/steps/en/,-->
 and the Global
School-Based Student Health Survey  
<span data-tippy-content="Global
School-Based Student Health Survey">
(<a href="https://www.who.int/teams/noncommunicable-diseases/surveillance/systems-tools/global-school-based-student-health-survey"
target="right" >GSHS</a>). </span>

Currently, the WHO STEPS ques&shy;tion&shy;naire includes
questions on fruit, vegetable, and salt/salty condiment 
con&shy;sump&shy;tion. The GSHS ques&shy;tion&shy;naire is under
revision; previously, it included 
core questions on fruits, vegetables, carbonated soft drinks, and food
from fast food restaurants. To date, neither 
of these surveys captures the &ldquo;whole of diet&rdquo;, and data
from these surveys have not been used to develop overall indices of diet quality.

<h3>8c.10.2 Food group diversity proxy indicators for micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents</h3>

Some food group diversity indicators have demonstrated 
associ&shy;ations with micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent adequacy of diets 

<span data-tippy-content="Verger, E. O., Le Port, A., Borderon, A., Bourbon, G., Moursi, M., Savy, M., Mariotti, F., & Martin-Prevel, Y. (2021). Dietary Diversity Indicators and Their Associations with Dietary Adequacy and Health Outcomes: A Systematic Scoping Review. Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.), nmab009. Advance online publication.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684194"
target="right" >Verger et&nbsp;al., 2021</a>).</span>

Because of this, several have been devel&shy;oped as simple proxies for
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent adequacy, for use when 
more complex indices are not feasible. These indicators do not
require use of food composition data, and they do 
not require detailed quantitative dietary intake data.
<p></p>
They were devel&shy;oped primarily for use in 
resource-constrained envi&shy;ron&shy;ments, where diets may be very
impoverished, low in food group diversity, and 
consequently provide inadequate micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents. They
are intended for popu&shy;lation-level use &mdash; for example, in 
monitoring trends &mdash; and not to describe diets of
individuals.
<p></p>
Indices were devel&shy;oped for several demographic 
groups, including infants and young children and
women of reproductive age. In both cases, construct 
validity was evaluated cross-sectionally by
comparing the simple indices to micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent 
density or adequacy of diets, in data sets from studies in
multiple low- and lower-middle income 
coun&shy;tries.

A &ldquo;Minimum Diet Diversity&rdquo; (MDD) indicator 
was devel&shy;oped as a proxy indicator of the micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent
density of the diet for infants and young 
children 6&ndash;23mos (WHO

<span data-tippy-content="WHO. (2008). Indicators for Assessing Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices - Part I (Definitions). Geneva: WHO.">

target="right" >2010</a>).</span>

MDD data can be collected using a lower-burden 
non-quantitative recall ques&shy;tion&shy;naire for food groups fed
to the infant or young child the day before the survey.
<p></p>
An updated version includes 8 food groups (below;

target="right" >WHO/UNICEF, 2021</a>).</span>

Infants and young children fed five or more of the eight
food groups, in any amount, meet the 
criterion for MDD. Groups of infants and young children 
meeting MDD are likely to have
a diet higher in micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent density 
than those who consume fewer food groups. Food groups are:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li class="numbered">Breast milk
<li class="numbered">Grains, white/pale starchy roots, tubers and plantains
<li class="numbered">Beans, peas, lentils, nuts and seeds
<li class="numbered">Dairy products (milk, infant formula, yogurt, cheese)
<li class="numbered">Flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, organ meats)
<li class="numbered">Eggs
<li class="numbered">Vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables
<li class="numbered">Other fruits and vegetables
</li>
</ul>
The MDD has been widely used and reported, with the
main global data sources being the Demo&shy;graphic
and Health Surveys 
(<a href="https://dhsprogram.com/"
target="right" >DHS</a>)
Program and the UNICEF Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys 
(<a href="https://mics.unicef.org/"

Prevalence data for MDD are available at the 
<a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/infant-and-young-child-feeding"
target="right" >UNICEF</a>
infant and young child feeding indicators database.
<p></p>
Recently, the World Health Organization and 
UNICEF have devel&shy;oped additional feeding indicators
relevant to diet quality of infants and young children, including 
indicators of sweet beverage con&shy;sump&shy;tion and con&shy;sump&shy;tion
of selected unhealthy food groups 
that may displace nutri&shy;ent-dense foods in their diets. However, there
is no overall summary index for 
diet quality that covers both micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent density and 
non-recom&shy;mended food groups 

<span data-tippy-content="WHO, UNICEF. (2021). “Indicators for Assessing Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices: Definitions and Measurement Methods.” Geneva. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/igo. ">

<p></p>
A simple food group diversity indicator, MDD-W, was 
also devel&shy;oped for non-pregnant women of
reproductive age as a proxy for micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent 
adequacy of the diet, partic&shy;ularly for use in 
settings where poverty results in monotonous diets 

<span data-tippy-content="Women's Dietary Diversity Project (WDDP) Study Group (2017). Development of a Dichotomous Indicator for Population-Level Assessment of Dietary Diversity in Women of Reproductive Age. Current devel&shy;op&shy;ments in nutrition, 1(12), cdn.117.001701.">

<p></p>
Like the infant and young child MDD indicator, data can be collected 
using a lower-burden non-quantitative recall
ques&shy;tion&shy;naire for food groups consumed 
the day before the survey. The recom&shy;mended data collection
methods are designed to exclude very small 
quan&shy;tities of con&shy;sump&shy;tion (&lt;&nbsp;15g) 

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2021).

<p></p>
Groups of women consuming five or more of the ten defined 
food groups are likely to have higher
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent adequacy than women consuming 
fewer food groups. The underlying 10&#8209;point score is
also associated with micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent adequacy.
<p></p>
The 10 food groups differ slightly from the infant and young child food groups, as follows:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li class="numbered">Grains, white roots and tubers, and plantains
<li class="numbered">Pulses (beans, peas, and lentils)
<li class="numbered">Nuts and seeds
<li class="numbered">Dairy
<li class="numbered">Meat, poultry and fish
<li class="numbered">Eggs
<li class="numbered">Dark-green leafy vegetables
<li class="numbered">Other vitamin&nbsp;A rich fruits and vegetables
<li class="numbered">Other vegetables
<li class="numbered">Other fruit
</li>
</ul>
MDD&#8209;W data are increasingly available, including 
from the 8th phase of the DHS Program 

<span data-tippy-content="8th phase of the DHS Program.Questionnaires: Revision Process and New Content DHSM11">
(<a href="https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSM11/DHSM11.pdf"

Both the original MDD and the MDD&#8209;W 
have also been evaluated for their usefulness in predicting
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ent adequacy for other 
demographic groups (for example,

target="right" >Diop et&nbsp;al., 2021</a>).</span>
<p></p>
Like the infant and young child MDD, the MDD&#8209;W was not 
devel&shy;oped to capture other char&shy;act&shy;eristics of diet quality, such
as NCD risk reduction. This is a key limitation, 
because in many resource-constrained envi&shy;ron&shy;ments, there is a
growing burden of overweight, obesity and associated NCDs, 
following on rapid nutrition transitions

<span data-tippy-content="Popkin, B. M., Corvalan, C., & Grummer-Strawn, L. M. (2020). Dynamics of the double burden of malnutrition and the changing nutrition reality. Lancet (London, England), 395(10217), 65&ndash;74.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31852602"
target="right" >Popkin, Corvalan, & Grummer-Strawn, 2020</a>).</span>

This limitation has been addressed in several recent
efforts to develop more compre&shy;hensive 
indices that can still be captured using lower-burden data
collection methods.

<h3>8c.10.3 Global Dietary Recom&shy;mendations Score</h3>

In addition to proposing an updated HDI&#8209;2020 
based on global recom&shy;mendations from the WHO and
the World Cancer Research Fund / American 
Institute for Cancer Research; (as described above), 

Herforth et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Herforth, A. W., Wiesmann, D., Martínez-Steele, E., Andrade, G., & Monteiro, C. A. (2020). Introducing a Suite of Low-Burden Diet Quality Indicators That Reflect Healthy Diet Patterns at Population Level. Current devel&shy;op&shy;ments in nutrition, 4(12), nzaa168.">
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33344879"
target="right" >2020</a>)</span>

also devel&shy;oped a Global Dietary Recom&shy;mendations (GDR) Score. 
The GDR Score is a lower-burden index capturing adherence to these
global recom&shy;mendations. It was explicitly 
devel&shy;oped as a complement to the MDD&#8209;W, to fill a gap in
low burden indices reflecting NCD risk reduction.
<p></p>
Like the MDD-W, the GDR Score is meant for 
use in assessing and monitoring diets at the popu&shy;lation level,
not the individual level. Construct validity 
was assessed by comparing the GDR Score to the HDI&#8209;2020 in
two nationally representative data sets, from 
Brazil and the United States, using data for ages &ge;15y.

Data for the GDR Score can be collected using a

The GDR Score 
(<a href="#table8c.8">Table&nbsp;8c.8</a>)
<a id="table8c.8"></a>
ranges from &minus;9 to &plus;9, 
based on sets of positively and negatively scored food groups.
Each food group has equal weighting 
except for processed meat, which has a score of &minus;2.
Overall, the score gives equal 
weighting to &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; com&shy;po&shy;nents.
<p></p>
The <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet"

guidance &mdash; one basis for the GDR Score &mdash; currently includes no
recom&shy;mendations on animal-source foods, 
though they can be good sources of bio&shy;avail&shy;able
micro&shy;nutri&shy;ents. Processed meat and unprocessed
red meat are included as negatively scored items to
limit, based on World Cancer Research Fund / American 
Institute for Cancer Research recom&shy;mendations. 
To capture nutri&shy;ent adequacy in resource-constrained
envi&shy;ron&shy;ments, the GDR Score can be considered 
alongside food group diversity scores such as the
MDD-W, which are designed to reflect 
nutri&shy;ent adequacy and include positive scoring for a variety of
animal-source foods.
<p></p>
The GDR Score is a recent innovation and should be 
further assessed in a wider range of country
contexts, with diverse cultural dietary patterns. 
Data to construct the GDR Score at national level will
be available for 40 coun&shy;tries from the 
 
<span data-tippy-content="2021 Gallup World Poll">

These data could provide baselines for
future assess&shy;ments of trends. Further details and updates on the GDR Score, including country-adapted ques&shy;tion&shy;naires for its measurement, are available from the

<h3>8c.10.4 Global Diet Quality Score</h3>

The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) represents 
another lower-burden approach to character&shy;izing diet
quality at popu&shy;lation level, including both 
nutri&shy;ent adequacy and NCD risk 

<span data-tippy-content="Bromage, S., Batis, C., Bhupathiraju, S. N., Fawzi, W. W., Fung, T. T., Li, Y., Deitchler, M., Angulo, E., Birk, N., Castellanos-Guti&eacute;rrez, A., He, Y., Fang, Y., Matsuzaki, M., Zhang, Y., Moursi, M., Gicevic, S., Holmes, M. D., Isanaka, S., Kinra, S., Sachs, S. E., … Willett, W. C. (2021). Development and Validation of a Novel Food-Based Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS).

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34689200"
target="right" >Bromage et&nbsp;al, 2021</a>).</span>

In contrast to the GDR Score, the GDQS is not based on adherence to
existing / current global guidance. Its 
devel&shy;op&shy;ment was similar to that of the 
AHEI, in that food groups
were selected for inclusion based on a review of 
literature demonstrating relation&shy;ships of food group
intakes to out&shy;comes. Further analyses of multiple 
data sets, including cross-sectional and cohort data,
led to refinement of the food groups and scoring.
<p></p>
The GDQS evolved from an earlier index 
initially devel&shy;oped for use in the United States as a clinical screener 

<span data-tippy-content="Rifas-Shiman, S. L., Willett, W. C., Lobb, R., Kotch, J., Dart, C., & Gillman, M. W. (2001).

(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11299098"
target="right" >Rifas-Shiman et&nbsp;al., 2001</a>).</span>

The global version was devel&shy;oped for 
popu&shy;lation-level use based
on extensive analyses of data sets from 
Africa (several coun&shy;tries), India, China, Mexico, and the US.
Construct validity was assessed relative to 
nutri&shy;ent adequacy, biomarkers for NCD risk, metabolic
syndrome and incidence of type&nbsp;2 
diabetes 

<span data-tippy-content="Bromage, S., Batis, C., Bhupathiraju, S. N., Fawzi, W. W., Fung, T.

<p></p>
Data require&shy;ments for the GDQS are inter&shy;mediate in 
complexity and, as for the MDD&#8209;W and the GDR
Score, no food composition data is 
needed to construct the GDQS. Semi-quantitative data are needed
to distinguish categories for quantity of 
intake for each of the 25 food group com&shy;po&shy;nents

Two food groups (high-fat dairy and red meat), 
considered unhealthy when consumed in excessive
amounts, have &ldquo;U-shaped&rdquo; scoring, such that both 
very low intakes and very high intakes are scored
lower than inter&shy;mediate intakes. Different from the other food 
groups in the index, which use 3&nbsp;categories for quantity of 
intake, the high-fat dairy food group uses 4&nbsp;categories to classify the quantity
of intake for scoring. The &ldquo;U-shaped&rdquo; scoring for the 
high-fat dairy and red meat food groups reflects
the role of these food groups both in meeting nutri&shy;ent adequacy, 
but also in NCD risk when consumed
in excess. Multiple weighting schemes 
were evaluated, and the selected com&shy;po&shy;nents are not equally
weighted. 
<p></p>
In addition to the overall score, ranging from 0&nbsp;to&nbsp;49, 
the GDQS also has two &ldquo;sub-metrics&rdquo; reflecting
con&shy;sump&shy;tion of healthy and unhealthy 
com&shy;po&shy;nents (<a href="#table8c.9">Table&nbsp;8c.9</a>).
Further, two cutoffs have been identified to allow for 
reporting the percent of the popu&shy;lation at high risk for poor diet quality
out&shy;comes (GDQS &lt;&nbsp;15) and the percent of the 
popu&shy;lation at low&nbsp;risk for poor 
diet quality out&shy;comes (GDQS&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;23).
<p></p>
Like the GDR Score, the GDQS is a recent innovation. 
Unlike the GDR Score, the semi-quantitative data
required to construct the GDQS cannot be derived from 
non-quantitative food group recalls
implemented to date in global survey programs such 
as the DHS, MICS and Gallup World Poll.
<p></p>
Lower-burden methods for the semi-quantitative 
recall required for the GDQS are currently under
devel&shy;op&shy;ment and include a technology-assisted data 
collection tool and the use of visual aids (a&nbsp;set of
3D&nbsp;cubes of specified size) for collecting data to
categorize the quantity of con&shy;sump&shy;tion per GDQS food group

<h3>8c.11   Incorporating sustain&shy;ability in diet 
quality definitions and indices</h3>

Current food systems are now known to contribute a 
significant share of global greenhouse gas
emissions and to contribute to land conversion, 
deforestation, and biodiversity loss; agriculture also
accounts for the majority of global freshwater 
withdrawals 

<span data-tippy-content="FAO and WHO. (2019). “Sustainable Healthy Diets &ndash; Guiding Principles.” Rome. ">
(<a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca6640en/ca6640en.pdf"
target="right" >FAO & WHO, 2019</a>).</span>

Recognition of this
has led to efforts to define diets that are both 
healthy and envi&shy;ron&shy;mentally sustain&shy;able, and to calls for
integration of sustain&shy;ability consider&shy;ations in 
national food-based dietary guide&shy;lines, as noted above

addressed sustain&shy;ability concerns and
provided a global &ldquo;healthy refer&shy;ence diet&rdquo;, 
with quantitative targets (and ranges) for food group intake,
based on a 2500 calorie diet 
(<a href="#table8c.10">Table&nbsp;8c.10</a>).
<a id="table8c.10"></a>
The refer&shy;ence diet was intended to be flexible and adaptable
to various cultural contexts.

The EAT-Lancet refer&shy;ence diet is high in plant-source foods 
and with limited amounts of animal-source
foods, with the low end of the &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; range for these 
foods set at zero. Currently, 
there is no established global guidance 
on the appropriate balance of plant-source and animal-source foods.
<p></p>
Some have raised concerns that the EAT-Lancet refer&shy;ence diet unneces&shy;sarily 
restricts nutri&shy;ent-dense animal-source foods

it is likely that additional research on

<h3>8c.12 Summary of diet quality indices</h3>

This section has presented a wide variety of diet quality 
indices developed for diverse uses. Indices are closely 
related to definitions of diet quality and have evolved with 
changing definitions. At national level, food-based dietary 
guidelines describe healthy diets, and indices developed to 
capture adherence to such guidelines are widely used. 
Currently, many indices &mdash; whether based on national, 
global, or other guidance &mdash; aim to reflect both 
nutrient adequacy and NCD risk reduction. 
Concerns with the impact of diets on planetary health are growing, 
and this is likely to result in new and more 
comprehensive indices in the near future.
<p></p>
Indices also vary widely in the data required for 
their calculation. Most indices developed 
for use in high-income data-rich environments 
require both detailed quantitative dietary 
intake data, and associated resources 
such as food composition databases. However, 
indices with lower data requirements 
have recently been proposed, for global use.
