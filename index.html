<div id="toc">

Nutritional assessment procedures were first
used in surveys designed to describe the nutritional
status of populations on a national
basis. The assessment methods used were initially described
following a conference held in 1932
by the Health Organization of the League of
Nations.
<p></p>
In 1955, the Interdepartmental Committee
on Nutrition for National Defense (ICNND)
was organized to assist low-income countries
in assessing the nutritional status of their
populations and to identify problems of malnu&shy;trition
and the ways in which they could be
solved. The ICNND teams conducted medical
nutri&shy;tion surveys in 24 countries. A
comprehensive manual was then produced and later, updated guidance issued

<span data-tippy-content="International Federation of Clinical Chemistry, Scientific Committee, Clinical Section. Expert Panel on Theory of Reference Values (EPTRV). The theory of reference values. Part 5. Statistical treatment of collected reference values. Determination of reference limits. (1984). Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry, 137(1), 97F–114F. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6697530/"
target="right" >ICNND, 1984</a>)</span>

with the intention of standardizing
both the assessment methods used for the collection
of nutri&shy;tion survey data and the inter&shy;pretation
of the results.
<p></p>
On the recom&shy;men&shy;dation of a World Health
Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on
Medical assessment of Nutritional Status,
a second publication was prepared by Jelliffe

<span data-tippy-content="Jelliffe D. B. (1966). The assessment of the nutritional status of the community (with special reference to field surveys in developing regions of the world). Monograph series. World Health Organization, 53, 3–271.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4960818/"
target="right" >1966</a>)</span>

in consultation with 25&nbsp;specialists
from various countries. This monograph was
directed specifically at the assessment
of the nutritional status of vulnerable groups in low-income
countries of the world.
<p></p>
Many of the methods described in this monograph are still used by the
the U.S.&nbsp;Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program to collect
representative data on popu&shy;lation, health, HIV, and nutri&shy;tion, and about
30&nbsp;indicators supporting the Sustainable
Development Goals. The data are used to
identify public health nutri&shy;tion problems so that effective
inter&shy;vention programs can be designed.  The
<a href="https://www.dhsprogram.com/"
target="right" >U.S.&nbsp;DHS program</a> has
conducted more than 400&nbsp;surveys in
over 90&nbsp;low&#8209;&nbsp;and middle-income countries since 1984.
<p></p>
Many higher income countries collect national data on the nutritional
status of the popu&shy;lation, some (e.g., the U.S. and the
U.K.) collecting data on an ongoing basis using nutri&shy;tion surveillance systems.
In the past, these systems have often targeted
high-risk populations, especially low-income
mothers, children under five, and pregnant
women. Now, with the growing awareness
of the role of nutri&shy;tion as a risk factor for
chronic diseases, surveillance systems often
encompass all age groups.

<h3 id="1.0">1.0   New developments in nutritional assessment</h3>

Today, nutritional assessment emphasizes new
simple non&shy;invasive approaches, particularly valuable in low
income countries, that can measure the risk of nutrient deficits and
excesses, and monitor and evaluate
the effects of nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;ventions.
These new approaches to assessment include
the measure&shy;ment of nutrients and bio&shy;markers
in dried blood spots prepared from
a finger-prick blood sample, avoiding the necessity
for venous blood collection and refrigerated
storage

<span data-tippy-content="Mei, J. V., Alexander, J. R., Adam, B. W., & Hannon, W. H. (2001). Use of filter paper for the collection and analysis of human whole blood specimens. The Journal of nutri&shy;tion, 131(5), 1631S–6S.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11340130/"
target="right" >Mei et&nbsp;al., 2001</a>)</span>.

In addition, for some nutrients, on-site analysis is now
possible, enabling researchers and respondents to obtain results immediately.
<p></p>
Many of these new approaches can also be
applied to bio&shy;markers monitoring the risk of
chronic diseases. These include bio&shy;markers
of antioxidant protection, soft-tissue oxidation,
and free-radical formation, all of which
have numerous clinical applications.
<p></p>
Increasingly, &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; instrumental platforms
for multiple micro&shy;nutrient
tests on a single sample aliquot are being
developed, some of which have been adapted for dried blood spot matrices

<span data-tippy-content="Brindle, E., Lillis, L., Barney, R., Bansil, P., Lyman, C., & Boyle, D. S. (2019). Measure&shy;ment of micro&shy;nutrient deficiency asso&shy;ciated bio&shy;markers in dried blood spots using a multiplexed immunoarray. PloS one, 14(1), e0210212. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30620768/"
target="right" >Brindle et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>).</span>

These assessment instruments are designed so they are of low complexity and can
be operated by labora&shy;tory technicians with minimal training, making them
especially useful in low- and middle-income countries

<span data-tippy-content="Esmaeili, R., Zhang, M., Sternberg, M. R., Mapango, C., & Pfeiffer, C. M. (2019). The Quansys multiplex immunoassay for serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, and α-1-acid glycoprotein showed good comparability with reference-type assays but not for soluble transferrin receptor and retinol-binding protein.

The public availability of e&#8209; and m&#8209;Health communication technologies
has increased dramatically in recent years.
e&#8209;Health is defined as: <blockquote> &ldquo;the use of
emerging infor&shy;mation and communications
technology, especially the internet, to
improve or enable health and health care&rdquo;
</blockquote> whereas m-Health inter&shy;ventions are
<blockquote>
&ldquo;those designed for delivery through mobile phones&rdquo;

<span data-tippy-content="Olson C. M. (2016). Behavioral Nutrition inter&shy;ventions Using e- and m-Health Communication Technologies: A Narrative Review. Annual review of nutri&shy;tion, 36, 647–664.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27022772/"
target="right" >Olson, 2016</a>).</span>

</blockquote>
Inter&shy;ventions using these communication technologies to assess, monitor and
improve nutri&shy;tion-related behaviors and body weight,
appear to be efficacious across cognitive outcomes, and some
behavioral and emotional outcomes, although changing dietary behaviors is a more
challenging outcome. There is an urgent need for a
rigorous scientific evaluation of e&#8209; and
m&#8209;health inter&shy;vention technologies. To date
their public health impact remains uncertain.
<p></p>
Nutritional assessment is also an essential
component of the nutritional care of the
hospitalized patient. The important relationship
between nutritional status and health,
and particularly the critical role of nutri&shy;tion
in recovery from acute illness or injury, is
well documented. Although it is many
years since the preva&shy;lence of malnu&shy;trition
among hospitalized patients was first reported

In the early 1990s, evidence-based medicine started as a movement in an effort to
optimize clinical care. Originally, evidence-based-medicine focused on critical
appraisal, followed by the development of
methods and techniques for generating
system&shy;atic reviews and clinical practice guidelines

Point of care technology (POCT) is also a
rapidly expanding health care approach that
can be used in diverse settings,
particularly those with limited health services or
labora&shy;tory infra&shy;structure, as the tests do not
require specialized equip&shy;ment and are
simple to use. The tests are also quick,
enabling prompt clinical decisions to be
made to improve the patient’s health at or near the site of patient care. The
development and evaluation of POC devices for the diagnosis of malaria,
tuberculosis, HIV, and other
infectious diseases is on-going and holds promise for
low-resource settings

Personalized nutri&shy;tion is also a
rapidly expanding approach that tailors dietary
recom&shy;men&shy;dation to the specific biological requirements of an individual on the
basis of their health status and
performance goals.  See
<a href="#1.1.5">Setion&nbsp;1.1.5</a>
for more details.

The approach has become possible with the increasing
advances in &ldquo;&#8209;omic
sciences&rdquo; (e.g., nutri&shy;genomics, proteomics and meta&shy;bol&shy;omics).
See Chapter 15 and van Ommen et&nbsp;al.

Health-care administrators and the community
in general, continue to demand demon&shy;strable
benefits from the investment of public
funds in nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;vention programs.
This requires improved techniques in
nutritional assessment and the monitoring and evaluation of
nutrition inter&shy;ventions. In addition, implementation research is now being
recognized as critical for maximizing
the benefits of evidence-based inter&shy;ventions.
Implementation research in nutri&shy;tion aims to build evidence-based
knowledge and sound theory to design and
implement programs that will deliver
nutri&shy;tion programs effectively.
However, to overcome the unique challenges faced
during the implementation of nutri&shy;tion and
health inter&shy;ventions, strengthening the
capacity of practitioners alongside
that of health researchers is essential.  Dako-Gyke et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Dako-Gyeke, P., Asampong, E., Afari, E., Launois, P., Ackumey, M., Opoku-Mensah, K., Dery, S., Akweongo, P., Nonvignon, J., & Aikins, M. (2020).

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32487176/"
target="right" >2020</a>)</span>

have developed an implementation research course curriculum
that targets both practitioners and
researchers simultaneously, and which is focused
on low&#8209; and middle-income countries.
<p></p>
The aim of this 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of &ldquo;Principles of Nutritional
assessment&rdquo; is to provide guidance on some
of these new, improved techniques, as well as a
comprehensive and critical appraisal of many of
the classic, well-established methods in nutritional assessment.

<h2 id="1.1">1.1 Nutritional assessment systems</h2>

Nutritional assessment systems involve
the inter&shy;pretation of infor&shy;mation from
dietary and nutritional bio&shy;markers, and anthro&shy;pometric and
clinical studies. The infor&shy;mation is used to determine the nutritional
status of individuals or popu&shy;lation
groups as influenced by the intake and utilization
of dietary substances and nutrients required to support growth, repair, and
maintenance of the body as a whole or in any of its parts

<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Raiten DJ, Combs GF. (2015). Directions in nutritional assessment. Sight and Life 29: 39-44.">
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.52439/EINA8537"
target="right" >Raiten and Combs, 2015</a>). </span>
<p></p>
Nutritional assessment systems can take
one of four forms: surveys, surveillance,
screening, or inter&shy;ventions. These are described
briefly below.

<h3 id="1.1.1">1.1.1   Nutrition surveys</h3>

The nutritional status of a selected popu&shy;lation
group is often assessed by means of
a cross-sectional survey. The survey may
either establish baseline nutritional data or
ascertain the overall nutritional status of the
popu&shy;lation. Cross-sectional nutri&shy;tion
surveys can be used to examine associations,
and to identify and describe popu&shy;lation subgroups
&ldquo;at&nbsp;risk&rdquo; for chronic malnu&shy;trition.
Causal relation&shy;ships cannot be established from
cross-sectional surveys because whether the exposure precedes or follows the
effect is unknown. They are also unlikely to identify acute malnu&shy;trition
because all the measure&shy;ments
are taken on a single occasion or within a
short time period with no follow-up.
Nevertheless, infor&shy;mation on preva&shy;lence,
defined as the proportion who have a
condition or disease at one time point, can be obtained from cross-sectional
surveys for use by health planners. Cross-sectional surveys
are also a necessary and frequent first step in subsequent investigations
into the causes of malnu&shy;trition or disease.
<p></p>
National cross-sectional nutri&shy;tion surveys generate valuable
infor&shy;mation on the preva&shy;lence of existing
health and nutritional problems in a country that can be used both
to allocate resources to those popu&shy;lation subgroups
in&nbsp;need, and to formulate policies to
improve the overall nutri&shy;tion of the popu&shy;lation.
They are also sometimes used to evaluate
nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;ventions by collecting baseline
data before, and at the end of a nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;vention
program, even though such a design is weak as the change may be attributable
to some other factor
(<a href="#1.1.4">Section&nbsp;1.1.4</a>).
<p></p>
Several large-scale national nutri&shy;tion surveys
have been conducted in industrialized
countries during the last decade. They include
surveys in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland,
New Zealand, and Australia. More than 400&nbsp;Demo&shy;graphic and Health Surveys
(DHS) in over&nbsp;90&nbsp;low&#8209; and middle-income countries have also been completed. See

<h3 id="1.1.2">1.1.2   Nutrition surveillance</h3>

The characteristic feature of surveillance is
the continuous monitoring of the nutritional
status of selected popu&shy;lation groups. Surveillance
studies therefore differ from nutri&shy;tion
surveys because the data are collected,
analyzed, and utilized over an extended
period of time. Sometimes, the surveillance only involves specific at&#8209;risk
subgroups, identified in earlier nutri&shy;tion surveys.
<p></p>
The infor&shy;mation collected from nutri&shy;tion surveillance programs can be used to
achieve the objec&shy;tives shown in Box&nbsp;1.1.

Surveillance studies, unlike cross-sectional nutri&shy;tion
surveys, can also identify the possible causes of both chronic and acute
malnu&shy;trition and, hence, can be used to
formulate and initiate inter&shy;vention measures
at either the popu&shy;lation or the subpopulation level.

In the United States, a comprehensive program of national
nutri&shy;tion surveillance, known as the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm/"
target="right" >(NHANES),</a>
has been conducted since 1959.
Data on anthro&shy;pometry, demographic and socio-economic status, dietary and
health-related measures are collected. In 2008, the United Kingdom began the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey"
target="right">National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Program</a>.
This is a continuous program of field work designed to assess the diet,
nutrient intake, and nutritional status of the general popu&shy;lation aged 1.5y
and over living in private house&shy;holds in the U.K.

WHO has provided some countries with
<a href="https://www.who.int/teams/noncommunicable-diseases/surveillance/systems-tools"

so that they can monitor changes in the global targets to reduce the high

Note that the term &ldquo;nutri&shy;tion monitoring,&rdquo;
rather than nutri&shy;tion surveillance, is often
used when the partic&shy;ipants selected are high&#8209;risk
individuals (e.g., food&#8209;insecure house&shy;holds, pregnant women).
For example, because house&shy;hold food insecurity is of increasing public health
concern, even in high-income countries
such as the U.S. and Canada, food insecurity is regularly
monitored in these countries using the Household Food Security Survey Module

<h3 id="1.1.3">1.1.3  Nutrition screening</h3>

The identification of malnour&shy;ished individuals
requiring inter&shy;vention can be accomplished
by nutri&shy;tion screening. This involves
a comparison of measure&shy;ments on individuals
with pre&shy;deter&shy;mined risk levels or &ldquo;cutoff&rdquo;
points using measure&shy;ments that are accurate, simple and cheap
(<a href="#1.5.3">Section&nbsp;1.5.3</a>), and which can be
applied rapidly on a large scale. Nutrition screening can be carried out on
the whole popu&shy;lation, targeted to a specific
subpopulation considered to be at risk, or on
selected individuals. The programs are usually less
comprehensive than surveys or surveillance studies.
<p></p>
Numerous nutri&shy;tion screening tools are
avail&shy;able for the early identification and
treat&shy;ment of malnu&shy;trition in
hospital patients and nursing homes, of which
Subjective Global assessment (SGA) and
the Malnutrition Universal Screening
Tool (MUST) are widely used; see
Barker et&nbsp;al.

In low-income countries, mid&#8209;upper&#8209;arm
circum&shy;ference (MUAC) with a fixed
cutoff of 115mm is often used as screening
tool to diagnose severe acute malnu&shy;trition
(SAM) in children aged

In the United States, screening is used to
identify individuals who might benefit
from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(<a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program"
target="right">SNAP</a>).
The program is means tested with highly selective qualifying criteria.
The SNAP (formerly food stamps) program
provides money loaded onto a payment card which can be used to
purchase eligible foods, to ensure that eligible
house&shy;holds do not go without foods. In general, studies have reported that participation in SNAP is asso&shy;ciated with a
significant decline in food insecurity

The U.S. also has a Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
and Children
(<a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic"

that targets low-income pregnant and post-partum women,
infants, and children &lt;&nbsp;5y. In&nbsp;2009, the USDA updated the WIC
food packages in an effort to
balance nutrient adequacy with reducing the risk of
obesity; details of the updates are avail&shy;able in NASEM

nationwide surveys of children aged &lt;&nbsp;4y.
The findings indicated that more WIC infants who received the updated WIC
food packages in&nbsp;2016 had nutrient intakes
(except iron) that met their estimated average requirements (EARs). Moreover,
vegetables provided a larger
contribution to their nutrient intakes, and intakes of
low&#8209;fat milks had increased for toddlers
aged 2y, likely contributing to their lower reported intakes of saturated fat.

<h3 id="1.1.4">1.1.4 Nutrition inter&shy;ventions</h3>

Nutrition inter&shy;ventions often target popu&shy;lation
subgroups identified as &ldquo;at&#8209;risk&rdquo; during
nutri&shy;tion surveys or by nutri&shy;tion screening.
In&nbsp;2013, the Lancet Maternal and Child
Nutrition Series recom&shy;mended a package of
nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;ventions that, if scaled to&nbsp;90%
coverage, could reduce stunting by&nbsp;20%

The nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;ventions considered included
lipid-based and micro&shy;nutrient supplementation,
food fortification, promotion of
exclusive breast feeding, dietary approaches, comple&shy;mentary feeding, and
nutri&shy;tion education.  More recently, nutri&shy;tion
inter&shy;ventions that address nutri&shy;tion-sensitive
agriculture are also being extensively investigated

Increasingly, health-care program administrators
and funding agencies are requesting evidence that inter&shy;vention programs are
implemented as planned, reach their target
group in a cost-effective manner, and are having the desired
impact. Hence, monitoring and evaluation are becoming an essential
component of all nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;vention programs.
However, because the etiology of malnu&shy;trition
is multi-factorial and requires a multi-sectorial response, the measure&shy;ment
and collection of the data from such multiple levels presents major challenges.

The construction of a PIP helps conceptualize
the program and its different components (i.e., inputs,
processes, outputs, and outcomes to impacts). Only with this infor&shy;mation can
issues in program design, implementation, or
utilization that may have the potential to limit the impact of the program,
be identified, and, in turn strengthened, so the
impact of the program can be optimized. Program impact pathway analysis
generally includes both quantitative and
qualitative methods (e.g., behavior-change
communication) to ascertain the coverage of an inter&shy;vention.
<p></p>
An example of the multiple levels of measure&shy;ments and data that were collected to
optimize the impact of a &ldquo;Homestead
Food Production&rdquo; program conducted in
Cambodia are itemized in Box&nbsp;1.2. Three program impact pathways were

The evaluation of any nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;vention program requires the choice of an
appro&shy;priate design to assess the
performance or effect of the inter&shy;vention. The
choice of the design depends on the purpose of the evaluation
and the level of precision required.
For example, for large scale public health
programs, based on the evaluation, decisions may be made to continue, expand,
modify, strengthen, or discontinue the program; these
aspects are discussed in detail by Habicht et&nbsp;al.

for more details. Three types of evaluation can be achieved from these
designs:  adequacy, plausibility and probability evaluation, each of which is
addressed briefly below.
<p></p>
<b>An adequacy evaluation</b> is achieved
when it has not been feasible to include a
comparison or control group in the inter&shy;vention design.
Instead, a within-group design has been used. In these circum&shy;stances,
the inter&shy;vention is evaluated on the basis of whether the expected changes
have occurred by comparing the outcome in
the target group with either a previously defined
goal, or with the change observed in the
target group following the inter&shy;vention
program. An example might be
distributing iron supplements to all the target
group (e.g., all preschool children with iron deficiency
anemia) and assessing whether the goal
of &lt;&nbsp;10% preva&shy;lence of iron-deficiency
anemia in the inter&shy;vention area after two
years, has been met. Obviously, when evaluating
the outcome by assessing the adequacy
of change over time, at least baseline and final
measure&shy;ments are needed. Note that because
there is no control group in this design, any
reported improvement in the group, even if it
is statistically significant, cannot be causally
linked to the inter&shy;vention.
<p></p>
<b>A plausibility evaluation</b>
can be conducted with several designs, including a
nonrandomized between-group design, termed a quasi-experimental design in
which the experimental group receives the inter&shy;vention, but the
control group does not. The design should
prefer&shy;ably allow blinding (e.g., use an identical
placebo). Because the partic&shy;ipants are not random&shy;ized
into the two groups, multi&shy;variate
analysis is used to control for potential confounding
factors and biases, although it may
not be possible to fully remove these statistically.
A between-group quasi-experimental
design requires more resources and is therefore
more expensive than the within-group
design discussed earlier, and is used when decision
makers require a greater degree of confidence
that the observed changes are indeed due to the inter&shy;vention program.
<p></p>
<b>A probability evaluation,</b>
when properly executed, provides the highest level of
evidence that the inter&shy;vention caused the outcome, and is considered the gold
standard method. The method requires the use of a random&shy;ized,
controlled, double-blind experimental design, in which
the partic&shy;ipants are randomly assigned
to either the inter&shy;vention or the control
group. Randomization is conducted to ensure
that, within the limits of chance, the treat&shy;ment
and control groups will be comparable at
the start of the study.  In some random&shy;ized trials,
the treat&shy;ment groups are communities and not
individuals, in which case they are known as
&ldquo;community&rdquo; trials.
<p></p>

<h3 id="1.1.5">1.1.5 assessment systems in a clinical setting</h3>

The types of nutritional assessment systems
used in the community have been adopted in
clinical medicine to assess the nutritional status
of hospitalized patients. This practice has
arisen because of reports of the high preva&shy;lence
of protein-energy malnu&shy;trition among
surgical patients in North America and elsewhere

<span data-tippy-content="Corish, C. A., & Kennedy, N. P. (2000). Protein-energy under&shy;nutri&shy;tion in hospital in-patients. The British journal of nutri&shy;tion, 83(6), 575–591.">

<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21556200/"

Today, nutritional assessment is often performed on
patients with acute traumatic injury, on those
undergoing surgery, on chronically ill medical
patients, and on elderly patients. Initially, screening can be carried out to
identify those patients requiring nutritional
management. A more detailed and comprehensive
baseline nutritional assessment of the
individual may then follow. This assessment
will clarify and expand the nutritional diagnosis,
and establish the severity of the malnu&shy;trition.
Finally, a nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;vention may be implemented,
often incorporating nutritional monitoring and an evaluation system,
to follow both the response of the patient to
the nutritional therapy and its impact.
Further details of protocols that have
been developed to assess the nutritional status
of hospital patients are given in Chapter&nbsp;27.
<p></p>
Personalized nutri&shy;tion is also a rapidly
expanding approach that is being used in a
clinical setting, as noted earlier.
The approach tailors dietary recom&shy;men&shy;dation to the specific
biological requirements of an
individual on the basis of their health status and
performance goals.  The latter are not
restricted to the prevention and/or mitigation
of chronic disease but often extend to
strategies to achieve optimal health and
well-being; some examples of these personal goals are depicted in

Personalized nutri&shy;tion necessitates
the use of a systems biology-based approach
that considers the most relevant
interacting biological mechanisms to formulate the
best recom&shy;mendations to meet the well&shy;ness goals of the individual.

<h3 id="1.1.6">1.1.6  Approaches to evaluate the
evidence from nutritional assessment studies</h3>

In an effort to optimize clinical care, evidence-based medicine (EBM)
started as a movement in the early 1990s to
enhance clinician's under&shy;standing, critical thinking,
and use of the published research literature,
while at the same time considering the patient’s
values and preferences. It focused on the quality of
evidence and risk of bias asso&shy;ciated with the types
of scientific studies used in nutritional
assessment as shown in the EBM hierachy of evidence
pyramid in
<a href="#figure1.2">Figure&nbsp;1.2</a>,
with random&shy;ized
controlled trials (RCTs) providing the strongest
evidence and hence occupying the top tier.

Figure&nbsp;1.2. Traditional EBM hierarchy of evidence pyramid.
The pyramidal shape
qualitatively integrates the amount of evidence generally
avail&shy;able from each type of
study design and the strength of evidence expected from indicated designs. In
each ascending level, the amount of
avail&shy;able evidence generally declines. Study
designs in ascending levels of the pyramid
generally exhibit increased quality of evidence and reduced risk of bias.
Confidence in causal relations increases at
the upper levels. Meta-analyses and system&shy;atic
reviews of observational studies and mechanistic
studies are also possible.  Redrawn from Yetley et&nbsp;al.

Even within each level there are differences in the quality of
evidence, depending on specific design features and conduct of the
study. For example, seven bias
domains are possible during the course of a study; these are shown in

<a href="#figure1.3">Figure&nbsp;1.3</a>.

Recognition of the importance of evaluating the evidence from individual studies has led to the development of three tools: Quality Assurance Instruments (QAIs), risk of bias tools, and an evidence-grading system.
<a href="https://www.sign.ac.uk/our-guidelines/sign-50-a-guideline-developers-handbook/"
target="right" >SIGN&nbsp;50</a>
is an example of a QAI that is widely used with
versions avail&shy;able for cohort studies, case-control studies, and RCTs,
and is based on a method&shy;ological checklist of items.
In the future,  QAIs will be avail&shy;able for nutri&shy;tion
studies based on RCTs, cohort,  case-control, and
cross-sectional studies with the aim of improving the
consistency with which nutri&shy;tion studies are assessed.
<p></p>
Risk of bias tools assess the degree of bias and are specific to study type. They
focus on internal validity. Examples include the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool used
to evaluate RCTs

and the

<span data-tippy-content="ROBINS-1 tool">
(<a href="https://methods.cochrane.org/robins-i"

best used to evaluate individual observational studies

Recognition of the limitations of the initial traditional
EBM hierarchy of evidence led to the concept of a system&shy;atic
review, now widely used to inform nutri&shy;tion decisions.
A system&shy;atic review is the application of scientific strategies to produce
comprehensive and repro&shy;ducible summaries
of the relevant scientific literature
through the system&shy;atic assembly,
critical appraisal, and synthesis of all relevant
studies on a specific topic

Systematic reviews aim to reduce bias and random error, and
provide clarification of the strength and
nature of all of the evidence in terms of the
quality of research studies, the consistency of the effect, and the evidence of
causality. These attributes are particularly useful when there is controversy or
conflicting results across the studies

The outcome of a system&shy;atic review is an evidence-based review (EBR) which
may include quantitative processes such as meta-analyses to analyze and
synthesize the data across the studies. However, combining the results of
individual studies can lead to misleading conclusions
unless the tools described above are applied to ensure the inclusion of the
candidate studies is appro&shy;priate and they are of
high quality.  Tools are also avail&shy;able
for assessing the overall quality of the evidence generated from a system&shy;atic
review and meta-analyses. Examples are
AMSTAR&nbsp;2007 and AMSTAR&nbsp;2 which are
avail&shy;able for the conduct , reporting, and subsequent meta-analyses of system&shy;atic
reviews based on RCTs and non-random&shy;ized studies, respectively. For details  see
<a href="https://amstar.ca/" target="right" >AMSTAR</a>.
In addition, several Web-based collaborative system&shy;atic review
tools are avail&shy;able (e.g.,
<a href="https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-019-1250-y" target="right" >SRDR</a>).
<p></p>
Risk of bias tools are also avail&shy;able for
system&shy;atic reviews, depending on whether
the studies included are random&shy;ized or non-random&shy;ized. Examples include
ROBINS for RCTs and
<a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/projects/robis/robis-tool/"
target = "right" >ROBIS</a>
that can assess risk of bias in both random&shy;ized and nonrandomized studies.
<p></p>
Evidence-grading systems
(<a href="#figure1.4">Figure&nbsp;1.4</a>)
are also used in system&shy;atic reviews. Many use

which uses evidence summaries to systematically grade
the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low for a series of outcomes.
<p></p>
For all system&shy;atic reviews, it is important
to separate the tasks, with a system&shy;atic
review team that is separate from the expert group responsible for reviewing the
evidence and interpreting the results. Some examples of the misuse of
meta-analysis which has led to
misleading conclusions can be found in Barnard et&nbsp;al.

Through the Guideline Development Groups (GDGs) at WHO, system&shy;atic reviews
are now used to inform the scientific judgment
needed for sound evidence-based public health nutri&shy;tion. The process is
used to establish nutrient reference values
(NRVs), food-based dietary guidelines,
and clinical or public health practice guidelines in dietetics and nutri&shy;tion.

<h2 id="1.2">1.2  Nutritional assessment methods</h2>

Historically,  nutritional assessment systems
have focused on methods to characterize each
stage in the development of a nutritional deficiency
state. The methods were based on
a series of dietary, labora&shy;tory-based bio&shy;markers, anthro&shy;pometric,
and clinical observations
used either alone or, more effectively, in combination.
<p></p>
Today, these same methods are used in
nutritional assessment systems for a wide
range of clinical and public health applications. For example, many low and
middle-income countries are now impacted by a triple burden of malnu&shy;trition,
where under&shy;nutri&shy;tion, multiple micro&shy;nutrient deficiencies,
and over&shy;nutrition co-exist. Hence, nutritional
assessment systems are now applied to define multiple
levels of nutrient status and not just the
level asso&shy;ciated with a nutrient deficiency state.
Such levels may be asso&shy;ciated with the maintenance of
health, or with reduction in the risk of chronic
disease; sometimes, levels leading to specific
health hazards or toxic effects are also defined

<span data-tippy-content="Combs G. F., Jr (1996). Should intakes with beneficial actions, often requiring supplementation, be considered for RDAs?. The Journal of nutri&shy;tion, 126(9 Suppl), 2373S–2376S. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8811800/"
target="right" >Combs, 1996</a>).</span>
<p></p>
There is now increasing emphasis on the use of new
functional tests to determine these multiple
levels of nutrient status. Examples include
functional tests that measure immune function,
muscle strength, glucose metabolism,
nerve function, work capacity, oxidative
stress, and genomic stability

The correct inter&shy;pretation of the results of
nutritional assessment methods requires
consid&shy;eration of other factors in addition
to diet and nutri&shy;tion. These may often
include socio&shy;economic status,
cultural practices, and health and vital statistics,
which collectively are sometimes termed &ldquo;ecological factors&rdquo;;
see
<a href="#1.2.5">Section&nbsp;1.2.5</a>.
When assessing the risk
of acquiring a chronic disease, environmental and
genetic factors are also important

<h3 id="1.2.1">1.2.1  Dietary methods</h3>

Dietary assessment methods provide data used to
describe exposure to food and nutrient intakes as well as information on food
behaviors and eating patterns that
cannot be obtained by any other method.  The
data obtained have multiple uses for
supporting health and preventing disease. For
example, health profes&shy;sionals use
dietary data for dietary counseling and education
and for designing healthy diets for
hospitals, schools, long-term care facilities and
prisons. At the popu&shy;lation level,
national food con&shy;sump&shy;tion surveys can generate
infor&shy;mation on nutrient adequacy within a country,
identify popu&shy;lation groups at
risk, and develop nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;vention programs.
Dietary data can also be used by
researchers to study relation&shy;ships
between diet and disease, and for formulating
nutri&shy;tion policy such as food-based dietary guidelines

<span data-tippy-content="Murphy, A. J., White, M., Viani, K., & Mosby, T. T. (2016). Evaluation of the nutri&shy;tion screening tool for childhood cancer (SCAN). Clinical nutri&shy;tion (Edinburgh, Scotland), 35(1), 219–224. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25765336/"
target="right" >Murphy et&nbsp;al., 2016</a>).</span>
<p></p>
It is important to recognize that nutrient inadequacies may arise from
a primary deficiency (low levels in the diet)
or because of a secondary deficiency.
In the latter case, dietary intakes may appear
to meet nutritional needs, but conditioning
factors (such as certain drugs, dietary components,
or disease states) interfere with the
ingestion, absorption, transport, utilization,
or excretion of the nutrient(s).
<p></p>
Several dietary methods are avail&shy;able,
the choice depending primarily on both the
study objec&shy;tives and the character&shy;istics of the
study group (see Chapter 3 for more details). Recently, many technical
improvements have been developed to improve the accuracy of dietary methods.
These include the use of digital photographs
of food portions displayed on a cell-phone
or a computer tablet, or image-based methods utilizing
video cameras, some wearable. Some of these methods
rely on active image capture by
users, and others on passive image capture whereby pictures are taken
automatically. Under development are wearable camera devices which objectively
measure diet without relying on user-reported food intake

Data on knowledge, attitudes and practices,
and reported food&#8209;related behaviors are
also collected. Historically, this has involved observing the participants,
as well as in&#8209;depth interviews and
focus groups &mdash; approaches based on ethnological
and anthropological techniques. Today, e&#8209;health (based on the internet)
and m&#8209;health (based on mobile phones) communication technologies are
also being used to collect these data, as noted earlier

All these methods are particularly useful
when designing and evaluating nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;ventions.
<p></p>
Often, infor&shy;mation on the proportion of the popu&shy;lation &ldquo;at
risk&rdquo; of inadequate intakes of nutrients is required.
Such infor&shy;mation can be used to ascertain whether assessment
using more invasive methods based on nutritional
bio&shy;markers are warranted in a specific popu&shy;lation or subgroup.

<h3 id="1.2.2">1.2.2 Laboratory Methods</h3>

Laboratory methods are used to measure nutritional biomarkers
which are used to describe status,
function, risk of disease, and response to treat&shy;ment.
They can also be used to describe exposure to certain foods or nutrients,
when they are termed &ldquo;dietary biomarkers&rdquo;.
Most useful are nutritional bio&shy;markers that distinguish
deficiency, adequacy and toxicity, and which assess aspects of physio&shy;logical
function and/or current or future health.
However, it must be recognized that a
nutritional bio&shy;marker may not be
equally useful across different applications or
life-stage groups where the critical
function of the nutrient or the risk of disease may be different

more prolonged and severe nutrient
deficiency states, and are often affected by
social and environmental factors so their
sensitivity and specificity are low.
In general, functional physio&shy;logical
tests (with the exception of
physical growth) are not suitable for
large-scale nutri&shy;tion surveys:
they are often too invasive, they may
require elaborate equip&shy;ment, and the results
tend to be difficult to interpret
because of the lack of cutoff points. Details of
functional physio&shy;logical or behavioral tests dependent
on specific nutrients are summarized
in

The growing preva&shy;lence of chronic diseases has led to
investigations to identify bio&shy;markers that can be used as substitutes for
chronic disease outcomes

Chronic disease events are
characterized by long developmental times, and are
multifactorial in nature with challenges in
differen&shy;tiating between casual and associative relations

<span data-tippy-content="Yetley, E. A., DeMets, D. L., & Harlan, W. R., Jr (2017b). Surrogate disease markers as substitutes for chronic disease outcomes in studies of diet and chronic disease relations. The American journal of clinical nutri&shy;tion, 106(5), 1175–1189.">

To qualify as a bio&shy;marker that is intended to
substitute for a clinical endpoint, the bio&shy;marker must be on the major
causal pathway between an inter&shy;vention (e.g., diet or dietary component)
and the outcome of interest (e.g., chronic disease).  Such bio&shy;markers are
termed &ldquo;surrogate&rdquo; bio&shy;markers; only a few such
bio&shy;markers have been identified for
chronic disease. Examples of well accepted
surrogate bio&shy;markers are blood
pressure within the pathway of sodium intake
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and low
density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL)
concen&shy;tration within a saturated fat and CVD
pathway; see Yetley et&nbsp;al

Increasingly, it is recognized that a
single bio&shy;marker may not reflect exclusively
the nutritional status of that single
nutrient, but instead be reflective of several
nutrients, their interactions, and metabolism.
This has led to the development of
&ldquo;all&#8209;in&#8209;one&rdquo; instrument platforms
that conduct multiple micro&shy;nutrient tests in a
single sample aliquot, as noted earlier.
A&nbsp;7&#8209;plex micro&shy;array immunoassay has been
developed for ferritin, soluble
transferrin receptor, retinol binding protein,
thyroglobulin, malarial antigenemia and
inflam&shy;mation status bio&shy;markers

which has subsequently been

Comparisons with reference&#8209;type assays indicate that with
some improvements in accuracy and
precision, these multiplex instrument platforms could
be useful tools for assessing multiple
micro&shy;nutrient bio&shy;markers in national
micro&shy;nutrient surveys in low
resource settings

<h3 id="1.2.3">1.2.3 Anthro&shy;pometric methods</h3>

Anthro&shy;pometric methods involve measure&shy;ments
of the physical dimensions and gross compo&shy;sition of the body

<span data-tippy-content="Physical status: the use and inter&shy;pretation of anthro&shy;pometry. Report of a WHO Expert Committee. (1995). World Health Organization technical report series, 854, 1–452. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8594834/"
target="right" >WHO, 1995</a>).</span>

The measure&shy;ments vary with age (and sometimes
with sex and race) and degree of nutri&shy;tion,
and they are particularly useful in circum&shy;stances
where chronic imbalances of protein
and energy are likely to have occurred.
Such disturbances modify the patterns of physical growth and the relative
proportions of body tissues such as fat, muscle, and total body water.
<p></p>
In some cases, anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ments
can detect moderate and severe degrees of malnu&shy;trition, but
cannot identify specific nutrient deficiency states.
The measure&shy;ments provide infor&shy;mation on past nutritional history,
which cannot be obtained with equal confidence using other assessment techniques.
<p></p>
Anthro&shy;pometry is used in both clinical and public
health settings to identify the
increasing burden of both under- and over-nutri&shy;tion
that now co-exist, especially in
low&#8209; and middle-income countries.
Measure&shy;ments can be
performed relatively quickly, easily, and reliably using
portable equip&shy;ment, provided standardized
methods and calibrated equip&shy;ment are used
(Chapters 10 and 11). To aid in their inter&shy;pretation,
the raw measure&shy;ments are generally expressed as an index,
such as height-for-age
(See <a href="#1.3">Section&nbsp;1.3</a>).
<p></p>
Standardized methods exist to evaluate
anthro&shy;pometric indices based on Z&#8209;scores
or percen&shy;tiles, both calculated in
relation to the distri&shy;bution of the corresponding
anthro&shy;pometric index for the healthy reference
popu&shy;lation
(<a href="#1.5.1">Section&nbsp;1.5.1</a>
and <a href="#1.5.2">Section&nbsp;1.5.2</a>).
Often Z&#8209;scores of below &minus;2 or above &plus;2
are used to designate individuals with
either unusually low or unusually high
anthro&shy;pometric indices, especially in low income countries. When used in this
way, the combination of index and
reference limit is termed an &ldquo;indicator&rdquo;,  a term
that relates to their use in nutritional
assessment, often for public
health, or social/medical decision-making
(see Chapter 13 for more details).
<p></p>
There is growing concern about the global
pandemic of obesity; individuals with
obesity are at higher risk of several
chronic diseases, including coronary heart
disease, diabetes, and hyper&shy;tension.
Consequently, numerous investigators have
compared the usefulness of anthro&shy;pometric
variables such as
body mass index (weight,kg) / (height, m)<sup>2</sup> (BMI)
and waist circum&shy;ference as surrogate measures of obesity.
In a meta-analysis of studies with at least a
12mos follow-up, Seo et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Seo, D. C., Choe, S., & Torabi, M. R. (2017). Is waist circum&shy;ference ≥102/88cm better than body mass index ≥30 to predict hyper&shy;tension and diabetes development regardless of gender, age group, and race/ethnicity? Meta-analysis.

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28137662/"

concluded that waist circum&shy;ference was a
better predictor for diabetes than BMI (&gt;&nbsp;30) in women
than men and for all ages &gt;&nbsp;60y,
whereas neither BMI &gt;&nbsp;30, nor waist circum&shy;ference
&gt;&nbsp;102cm (for men), &gt;&nbsp;88cm (for women)
were significant predictors of hyper&shy;tension.

<h3 id="1.2.4">1.2.4 Clinical methods</h3>

A medical history and a physical examination
are the clinical methods used to detect signs,
(obser&shy;vations made by a qualified examiner)
and symptoms (manifestations reported
by the patient) asso&shy;ciated with malnu&shy;trition
or risk of chronic disease. The latter is
defined by IOM

<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine Committee on Qualification of Bio&shy;markers and Surrogate Endpoints in Chronic Disease; Board on Health Care Services; Board on Health Sciences Policy; Food and Nutrition Board. In: Micheel CM, Ball JR, editors. Evaluation of bio&shy;markers and surrogate endpoints in chronic disease. Washington (DC): National Academies Press; 2010. ">

as a culmination of a series of pathogenic processes in
response to internal or external stimuli over time that results in a clinical
diagnosis&shy;/ailment and health outcomes; examples include diabetes, cancer,
coronary heart disease,  stroke, and arthritis.
The signs and symptoms may be nonspecific and develop only
during the advanced stages of a nutrient
deficiency (or excess) or chronic disease;
for this reason, their diagnosis should not rely exclusively
on clinical methods. It is obviously desirable
to have the capacity to detect marginal nutrient
deficiencies and risk of chronic disease before a clinical syndrome develops.
<p></p>
Several labora&shy;tory-based bio&shy;markers
exist to assess an individual’s level of
risk of developing a disease and as substitutes
for chronic disease outcomes; they
are often included as an adjunct to clinical assessment. Examples include serum
ferritin for risk of iron deficiency anemia,
glycosylated hemo&shy;globin (HbA1c) for
risk of diabetes, and alterations in bone mineral
density for changes in fracture risk.
Examples of surrogate bio&shy;markers intended to substitute for
chronic disease outcomes include LDL cholesterol
instead of the true clinical outcome CVD and blood
pressure for cardiovascular disease, as noted earlier

<h3 id="1.2.5">1.2.5 Ecological factors</h3>

Increasingly, nutritional assessment methods include
the collection of infor&shy;mation on a variety of
other factors known to influence the nutritional
status of individuals or populations. This increase has stemmed, in part, from the
the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) conceptual framework for the
causes of childhood malnu&shy;trition shown in
<a href="#figure1.5">Figure&nbsp;1.5</a>,
and the increasing focus on studies of diet and chronic disease

<span data-tippy-content="Yetley, E. A., MacFarlane, A. J., Greene-Finestone, L. S., Garza, C., Ard, J. D., Atkinson, S. A., Bier, D. M., Carriquiry, A. L., Harlan, W. R., Hattis, D., King, J.

target="right" >Yetley et&nbsp;al., 2017a</a>).</span>

<p></p>
The UNICEF framework highlights that child malnu&shy;trition is the outcome of a
complex causal process involving not just the
immediate deter&shy;minants such as inadequate dietary intake and poor care,
but also the under&shy;lying and basic enabling deter&shy;minants depicted in

<a href="#figure1.5">Figure&nbsp;1.5</a>.

As a consequence, several variables asso&shy;ciated with
the under&shy;lying and enabling deter&shy;minants of
child malnu&shy;trition are included in nutritional assessment systems,
including in the Demographic Health Surveys
conducted in low&#8209; and middle-income
countries. Variables addressing the under&shy;lying deter&shy;minants include
house&shy;hold compo&shy;sition, education, literacy, ethnicity, religion, income,
employment, women’s empower&shy;ment, material resources,
water supply, house&shy;hold sanitation, and hygiene (i.e, WASH)
and access to health and agricultural
services, as well as land ownership and other infor&shy;mation.
<p></p>
Additional data on food prices, the adequacy of food preparation equip&shy;ment,
the degree of food reserves, cash-earning oppor&shy;tunities,
and the percentage of the house&shy;hold income spent on certain foods such as
animal foods, fruits, and vegetables can also
be collected, if appro&shy;priate.
<p></p>
Data on health and vital statistics may also
be obtained, as may infor&shy;mation on the percentage
of the popu&shy;lation with ready access to
a good source of drinking water, the proportion
of children immunized against measles,
the proportion of infants born with a low birth
weight, the percentage of mothers practicing exclusive breastfeeding
up to six&nbsp;months, and and age&#8209; and cause-specific mortality rates.
<p></p>
Some of these non-nutritional variables are strongly
related to malnu&shy;trition and can be used to
identify at&#8209;risk individuals during surveillance
studies.  For example, Morley

<span data-tippy-content="Morley D. (1973). Pediatric Priorities in the Developing
World. Butterworth, London. *** Book - NOT ON MEDLINE ***  ">

identified birth order over seven, breakdown
of marriage, death of either parent, and episodes
of infectious diseases in early life as
being important factors in the prediction of
West African children who were nutritionally
at risk. In a study in the state of Maharashtra in India, Aguayo et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Aguayo, V. M., Nair, R., Badgaiyan, N., & Krishna, V. (2016).

reported that after controlling for
potential confounding, the most consistent
predictors of stunting and poor linear
growth in children under 23mos were birth&shy;weight and child feeding, women’s
nutri&shy;tion and status, and house&shy;hold
sanitation and poverty. Women’s empower&shy;ment
has also been shown to
significantly influence child nutri&shy;tion,
infant and young child feeding practices,
and reproductive health service utilization
in some studies

<h2 id="1.3">1.3  Nutritional assessment indices and indicators</h2>
<p></p>
Raw measure&shy;ments alone have no meaning
unless they are related to, for example, the
age or sex of an individual

<span data-tippy-content="Physical status: the use and inter&shy;pretation of anthro&shy;pometry. Report of a WHO Expert Committee. (1995). World Health Organization technical report series, 854, 1–452. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8594834/"
target="right" >WHO, 1995</a>).</span>

Hence, raw measure&shy;ments derived from each
of the four methods are often (but not always)
combined to form &ldquo;indices.&rdquo; Examples
of such combinations include height-for-age,
nutrient density (nutrient intake
per megajoule), BMI ((weight kg) / (height m)<sup>2</sup>),
and mean cell volume ((hematocrit) /
(red blood cell count)). These indices are
all continuous variables. Construction of indices
is a necessary step for the inter&shy;pretation
and grouping of measure&shy;ments collected by
nutritional assessment systems, as noted earlier.
<p></p>
Indices are often evaluated in clinical
and public health settings by comparison
with pre&shy;deter&shy;mined reference limits or
cutoff points
(<a href="#1.5">Section&nbsp;1.5</a>).
Reference limits in anthro&shy;pometry in low income countries
are often defined by Z&#8209;scores below &minus;2, as noted earlier.
For example, children <span class="n">aged 6&ndash;60mos</span> with a
height-for-age Z&#8209;score  &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2 are
referred to as &ldquo;stunted&rdquo;. When used in this way,
the index (height&#8209;for&#8209;age) and the
asso&shy;ciated reference limit (i.e., &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2 Z&#8209;score)
are together termed an &ldquo;indicator&rdquo;,
a term used in nutritional assessment,
often for public health or social/medical
decision-making at the popu&shy;lation level.
<p></p>
Several anthro&shy;pometric indicators have been recom&shy;mended by the WHO.  For
example, they define &ldquo;underweight&rdquo; as a
weight-for-age &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2 Z&#8209;score, &ldquo;stunted&rdquo;
as length/height-for-age  &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2 Z&#8209;score),
and &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; as
weight-for-length/height  &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2 Z&#8209;score.
In children
<span class="n">aged 0&ndash;5y,</span> WHO uses a Z&#8209;score
above &plus;2 for BMI&#8209;for&#8209;age as an indicator
of &ldquo;overweight&rdquo;, and above &plus;3 as an indicator of obesity

Indicators should be chosen carefully in relation
to both the study objec&shy;tives and their
attributes. They can be used to meet a variety
of objec&shy;tives. For example, if the objec&shy;tive of
the program is to evaluate the
treat&shy;ment of malnu&shy;trition, then the indicator
chosen must have the potential to respond
to the specific inter&shy;vention under study and
must relate to the nature and severity of the
malnu&shy;trition present. Thus, the same indicators
are not appro&shy;priate for evaluating the
treat&shy;ment of stunting versus wasting. Further,
several factors will affect the magnitude
of the expected response of an indicator.
These may include the degree of deficiency,
age, sex, and physio&shy;logical state of the target
group. Other influencing factors may be the
type and duration of the inter&shy;vention, home
diet, the age&#8209;specificity of the response, and
whether the indicator is homeo&shy;statically controlled.
A more detailed discussion of the
selec&shy;tion criteria for indicators can be found
in Habicht et&nbsp;al.

<h2 id="1.4">1.4   The design of nutritional assessment systems</h2>	

The design of the nutritional assessment system
is critical if time and resources are to
be used effectively. The assessment system
used, the type and number of measure&shy;ments
selected, and the indices and indicators derived
from these measure&shy;ments will depend
on a variety of factors.
<p></p>
Efforts have increased dramatically in the past
decade to improve the content and quality of
nutritional assessment systems, especially those
involving clinical trials. In 2013, guidelines
were published on clinical trial protocols
entitled: Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations
for International Trials
(<a href="https://spirit-statement.org/"
target="right" >SPIRIT</a>).
This has led to the compulsory pre&shy;regis&shy;tration of clinical trials,
and often publication of the trial protocols
in scientific journals. The SPIRIT checklist consists of
33&nbsp;recom&shy;mended items to include in a clinical trial.

An additional suggestion to support

to distinguish data-driven analyses from pre-planned analyses is the
publication of a statistical analysis plan before data have been accessed

<h3 id="1.4.1">1.4.1   Study objec&shy;tives and ethical issues</h3>

The general design of the assessment system,
the raw measure&shy;ments, and, in turn,
the indices and indicators derived from these
measure&shy;ments should be dictated by the study
objec&shy;tives. Possible objec&shy;tives may include:
<ol style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li class="numbered">Determining the overall nutritional status
of a popu&shy;lation or subpopulation</li>
<li class="numbered">Identifying areas, populations, or subpopulations
at risk of chronic malnu&shy;trition</li>
<li class="numbered">Characterizing the extent and nature of
the malnu&shy;trition within the popu&shy;lation or
subpopulation</li>
<li class="numbered">Identifying the possible causes of malnu&shy;trition
within the popu&shy;lation or subpopulation</li>
<li class="numbered">Designing appro&shy;priate inter&shy;vention programs
for high-risk populations or subpopulations</li>
<li class="numbered">Monitoring the progress of changing nutritional,
health, or socio&shy;economic influences,
including inter&shy;vention programs</li>
<li class="numbered">Evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness
of inter&shy;vention programs</li>
<li class="numbered">Tracking progress toward the attainment
of long-range goals.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
The first three objec&shy;tives can be met by a
cross-sectional nutri&shy;tion survey, often involving
all three of the major methods of nutritional assessment.
Such surveys, however, are unlikely to provide
infor&shy;mation on the possible causes of
malnu&shy;trition (i.e., objec&shy;tive no.&nbsp;4). The latter
can only be achieved through interventions (objectives no.&nbsp;5 and no.&nbsp;7)
and possibly objective no.&nbsp;6.
An assessment of the possible
causes of malnu&shy;trition is a necessary prerequisite
when implementing nutri&shy;tion inter&shy;vention programs.
<p></p>
In some circum&shy;stances, the objec&shy;tive may
be to identify only those individuals at risk
of malnu&shy;trition and who require inter&shy;vention
(i.e., objec&shy;tive no.&nbsp;5). To achieve this objec&shy;tive,
a screening system is required that uses
simple and cheap measure&shy;ments and reflects
both past and present nutritional status.
<p></p>
<b>Ethical issues</b>
<p></p>
Formal guidelines on the general conduct of
biomedical research is contained in the declaration
of Helsinki on Ethics and Epidemiology,
published by the Council for International
Organization of Medical Sciences

<span data-tippy-content="CIOMS Guidelines">
(<a href="https://cioms.ch/publications/product/international-ethical-guidelines-for-health-related-research-involving-humans/"

Ethical approval from the
appro&shy;priate human ethics committees in the
countries involved in the research study must
be obtained by the principal investigators before
work begins. The basic guidelines for research
on human subjects must be followed.
As an example, sections of the regulations of
the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services

<span data-tippy-content="U.S. Department of Health and Human Services">

all studies. When securing informed consent,
the investigator should also:
<ul class="padded">

<li>Clearly state the asso&shy;ciated potential risks and benefits
<li>Confirm that participation in the research is voluntary
<li>Confirm that partic&shy;ipants are free to withdraw

With the increasing reliance on random&shy;ized
clinical trials (RCT) to inform
evidence-based practice, there have been
coordinated attempts to standardize
reporting and to register infor&shy;mation
about trials for consistency and transparency.
This has led to the publication of the
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
(CONSORT). The CONSORT guidelines specify details that
should be well-defined in every RCT, and
many journals now require these
guidelines to be addressed as a condition of
publication. The first CONSORT
guidelines were published in 2001 and were
revised in
<span data-tippy-content="Consort Guidelines">

been developed which meet the following ICMJE criteria.
These include the registry should be accessible to the public;
there should be no charge for registration;
open to all interested registrants,
managed by a nonprofit organization, and have a
means for verifying the validity of the registered

<h3 id="1.4.2">1.4.2 Choosing the study partic&shy;ipants and the sampling protocol</h3>

Nutritional assessment systems often target
a large popu&shy;lation &mdash; perhaps that of a city,
province, or country.  That popu&shy;lation is best referred to as
the &ldquo;target popu&shy;lation&rdquo;. To ensure that
the chosen target popu&shy;lation has demographic and
clinical character&shy;istics of relevance to the
question of interest, a specific
set of inclusion criteria should be defined.
However, for practical reasons,
only a limited number of individuals within
the target popu&shy;lation can actually be studied.
Hence, these individuals must be chosen carefully
to ensure the results can be used to infer
infor&shy;mation about the target popu&shy;lation.
This can be achieved by defining a set of
exclusion criteria to eliminate individuals
who it would be unethical or inappro&shy;priate to
study; as few exclusion criteria
as possible should be specified.
The technique of selecting a sample representative
of the target popu&shy;lation and of a size adequate
for achieving the primary study objec&shy;tives,
requires the assistance of a statistician;
only a very brief review is provided here.
<p></p>
A major factor influencing the choice of
the sampling protocol is the availability of
a sampling frame. Additional factors
include time, resources, and logistical
constraints. The sampling frame is usually a comprehensive list
of all the individuals in the popu&shy;lation
from which the sample is to be chosen. In
some circum&shy;stances, the sampling
frame may consist of a list of
districts, villages, institutions, school or house&shy;holds, termed
&ldquo;sampling units&rdquo; rather than individuals <i>per se.</i>
<p></p>
When a sampling frame is not avail&shy;able,
nonprobability sampling methods
must be used. Three nonprobabilty sampling
methods are avail&shy;able: consecutive
sampling, convenience sampling, and
quota sampling, each of which is described
briefly in Box&nbsp;1.7.  Note
that the use of nonprobability sampling methods
produces samples that may not be representative
of the target popu&shy;lation and hence may lead to system&shy;atic
bias: such methods should be fully documented.

<div class="box">
<b>Box&nbsp;1.7  Nonprobability sampling protocols</b>
<ul class="padded">
<li><b>Consecutive sampling</b> is the best of the nonprobability
techniques. It is used, for example,
in clinical research, when it is feasible to recruit
all avail&shy;able patients who meet the selec&shy;tion criteria,
over a time period that is long enough to avoid
seasonal factors or other changes over time.

<li><b>Convenience sampling</b> involves taking individuals
into the study who happen to be avail&shy;able at the
time of data collection and who consent to participate.
This approach is used when the popu&shy;lation
to be sampled is relatively homogeneous

<li><b>Quota sampling</b> involves dividing the target
popu&shy;lation into a number of different categories based on
age, ownership of land, or occupations etc, and taking a certain
number of consenting individuals from each
category into the final sample.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

Several possible sources of bias can occur when
nonprobability sampling is used, as shown by the three
domains (nos&nbsp;1&ndash;3) depicted in
<a href="#figure1.3">Figure&nbsp;1.3</a>.
Some specific examples include the following:
<ul class="padded">
<li>Ignoring people who do not respond to an initial approach to include them in
the study &mdash; the non-response bias. People who refuse to take part may have
character&shy;istics that differ markedly from those of the respondents.
<li>Studying only volunteers who are often unrepre&shy;sentative of most of the
popu&shy;lation.
<li>Sampling only those persons attending a clinic, school, or health center, and
neglecting to include non-attendees.
<li>Collecting data at only one time of the year, which may introduce a seasonal
bias.
<li>Selecting partic&shy;ipants who are
accessible by road introduces a &ldquo;tarmac&rdquo; bias.
Areas accessible by road are likely to be system&shy;atically different from those
that are more difficult to reach.
</li></ul>

It is essential to fully document the
charac&shy;teristics of the sample and to identify the
probable direction and magnitude of the bias that arises
from the adopted sample protocol and nonres&shy;ponse rate.
Extrapolating the results from a
nonprobability sample to the target
popu&shy;lation is risky and should be avoided.
<p></p>
Every attempt should be made to compile
some type of sampling frame, or to
use one that already exists, so that probability
sampling can be used

Probability sampling is the recom&shy;mended
method for obtaining a representative
sample with minimum bias.
<p></p>
In settings where maps and census data are
out of date or non-existent such as in
poor urban environments, creating a sampling
frame to select a representative
sample is particularly challenging.
Investigators working in urban slums in
four low-income countries have described a
method for creating a spatially-referenced
sampling frame consisting of a census
of all house&shy;holds in a slum from which a
spatially-regulated representative sample
can be generated; see the Improving Health
in Slums Collaborative

for more details.
<p></p>
Several probability sampling methods exist: simple
random sampling, system&shy;atic sampling, stratified
random sampling, cluster sampling, and
multistage sampling. Every effort must be made to
minimize the number of nonrespondents so that the generalizability
(i.e., external validity) of the study is not compromised.
The level of nonres&shy;ponse that will compromise
the generalizability of the study
depends on the nature of the research question
and on the reasons for not
responding. Strategies exist for minimizing refusal to participate
in the study; see Hulley et&nbsp;al.

are described in Box&nbsp;1.8; further

<div class="box">
<b>Box&nbsp;1.8 Probability sampling protocols</b>
<ul class="padded">
<li>Simple random sampling involves drawing a
random sample from a listing of all the people in the target popu&shy;lation.

<li>Stratified random sampling divides the target
popu&shy;lation into a number of subgroups or
strata (e.g., urban and rural populations, different
ethnic groups, various geographical areas, or
administrative regions). A separate random sample
is then drawn from each of the strata. The stratified
subsamples can be weighted to draw dispro&shy;portion&shy;ately from subgroups that are
less common in the popu&shy;lation but of special interest.

<li> random sampling requires defining a
number of levels of sampling, from each of which
is drawn a random sample.
</li></ul></div>

<b>Cluster sampling</b> requires defining a random
sample of natural groupings
(clusters) of individuals in the popu&shy;lation.
This method is used when the
popu&shy;lation is widely spaced and it is
difficult to compile a sampling frame, and
thus sample from all its elements.
Statistical analysis must take clustering into
account because cluster sampling tends to result in
more homogeneous groups for
the variables of interest in the popu&shy;lation.
 <p></p>
<b>Stratified sampling</b> results in a
sample that is not necessary representative of
the actual popu&shy;lation. The imbalance can
be corrected, however, by weighting,
allowing the results to be generalized to the target
popu&shy;lation. Alternatively,
a sampling strategy, termed proportional
stratification, can be used to adjust the
sampling before selecting the sample, provided
infor&shy;mation on the size of the sampling
units is avail&shy;able. This approach simplifies
the data analysis and also ensures that subjects
from larger communities have a pro&shy;portion&shy;ately
greater chance of being selected
than do subjects from smaller communities.
<p></p>
<p></p>
<b>Multistage random sampling</b> is frequently used
in national nutri&shy;tion surveys. It typically
involves sampling at four stages:
at the provincial or similar
level (stage one), at the
district level (stage two),
at the level of communities in each selected district
(stage three), and at the house&shy;hold level in each
chosen community (stage four). A random
sample must be drawn at each stage. The
U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III, the U.K.&nbsp;Diet and Nutrition
surveys, and the New&nbsp;Zealand and Australian
national nutri&shy;tion surveys all used a combination
of stratified and multistage random
sampling techniques to obtain a sample representative
of the civilian non-institutionalized
populations of these countries.
<p></p>
As can be seen, each probability sampling protocol involves a
random selec&shy;tion procedure to ensure that
each sampling unit (often the individual) has
an equal probability of being sampled. Random
selec&shy;tion can be achieved by using a
table of random numbers, a computer program
that generates random numbers, or a
lottery method; each of these procedures is
described in Varkisser et&nbsp;al.

<h3 id="1.4.3">1.4.3  Calculating sample size</h3>

The appro&shy;priate sample size for a particular nutritional assessment project
should be estimated early in the process of developing the project
design so that, if necessary, modifications to the design can be made.
The number of partic&shy;ipants required will depend
on the study objec&shy;tive, the nature
and scope of the study, and the
&ldquo;effect size&rdquo; &mdash; the magnitude of the expected
change or difference sought. The estimate obtained
from the sample size calculation represents the planned
number of individuals with data at outcome,
and not the number who should be enrolled. The investigator
should always plan for dropouts and individuals with missing data.
<p></p>
The first step in the process of estimating the
sample size is restating the research hypothesis to one that proposes no
difference between the groups that are being compared. This
restatement is called the &ldquo;null&rdquo; hypothesis.
Next, the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; hypothesis should be stated,
which, if  one-sided, specifies the actual magnitude of the expected
&ldquo;effect size&rdquo; and the direction of the
difference between the predictor and outcome variable.
In most circum&shy;stances, however, a two-sided alternative
hypothesis is stated, in which case only the effect size
is specified and not the direction.
<p></p>
The second step in the estimation of sample size
is the selec&shy;tion of a reasonable
effect size (and variability, if necessary).
As noted earlier,  this is rarely known, so instead
both the effect size and variability must be estimated
based on prior studies in the literature, or
selected on the basis of the smallest effect
size that would be considered clinically meaningful.
Sometimes a small pilot study is conducted to
estimate the variability (<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>) of the variable.
When the outcome variable is the change of a continuous
measure&shy;ment (e.g., change in a child's length during the study),
the <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> used should be the
variance of this change.
<p></p>
The third step involves setting both &alpha; and &beta;.	
The probability of committing a type&nbsp;1 error
(rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true)
is defined as &alpha;. Another widely used
name for &alpha; is the level of significance.
It is often set at 0.05, when it represents
a 95% assurance that a significant result will
not be achieved when it should not
(i.e., the null hypothesis will not be rejected).
If  a one-tailed alternative hypothesis has been set,
then a one-tailed&nbsp;&alpha; should be used;
otherwise, use a two-tailed&nbsp;&alpha;.
<p></p>
The probability of committing a type&nbsp;II error
(i.e.,failing to reject the null hypothesis
when it is actually false) is defined as &ldquo;&beta;&rdquo;,
and is often set at 0.20,
indicating that the investigator is willing to accept a
20% chance of missing an association of the
specified effect size if it exists.
The quantity 1&minus;&beta; is called the power,
and when set at 0.80 implies there is a
80% chance of finding an association of that size or
greater when it really exists.
<p></p>
The final step involves selecting the appro&shy;priate procedure for
estimating the sample size. Two different procedures
can be used depending on how the effect size is specified.
Frequently, the objec&shy;tive is to determine the sample size to detect
differences in the <b>Proportion
of individuals</b> in two groups. For example, the
proportion of male infants age 9mos who
develop anemia while being treated with iron supplements
(Hemoglobin&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;110g/L) is to be
compared to the proportion
who develop anemia while taking a placebo.
The procedure is two&#8209;sided, allowing for the possibility
that the placebo is more effective than the supplement!
Note that the effect size is the difference in the projected proportions
in the two groups and that the size of that differences
critically controls the required sample size.
See, <a href="https://select-statistics.co.uk/calculators/sample-size-calculator-two-proportions/"
target="right" >Sample size calculator - two proportions.</a>
<p></p>
In a cohort or experimental study, the effect size is
the difference between P<sub>1</sub>, the
proportion of individuals expected to have the outcome in one group
and P<sub>2</sub>, the proportion expected in the other group.
Again, this required effect size must be specified,
along with &alpha;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&beta; to calculate
the required sample size.
<p></p>
In contrast, in a case-control study, P<sub>1</sub>
represents the proportion of cases expected to
have a particular dichotomous predictor variable (i.e., the
preva&shy;lence of that predictor), and P<sub>2</sub>
represents the proportion of controls
who are expected to have the dichotomous predictor.
<p></p>
For examples when the effect size is specified in terms of relative risk  or odds ratio (OR), see  Browner et&nbsp;al. in Chapter 6 in Hulley et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Hulley, S. B., Cummings, S. R., Browner, W. S., Grady, D. G., & Newman, T. B. (2013). Designing Clinical Research: An Epidemiologic Approach (2nd ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins. ">
(<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwieotOZ3Y70AhWWbysKHaSUAuQQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FHaider_Ghazi%2Fpost%2FAny_Textbook_for_Teaching_Research_Methods_in_Information_Systems%2Fattachment%2F5ad064954cde260d15d88275%2FAS%253A614865118982150%25401523606676739%2Fdownload%2FDesigning%2Bclinical%2Bresearch%2B4th%2Bed.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3HySpEfGgEwFWI9AZqbx7D"
target="right" >2013</a>).</span>
<p></p>
Alternatively, the objec&shy;tive may be to calculate an appro&shy;priate
sample size to detect if the <b>mean value of a continuous
variable</b> in one group differs significantly from
the mean of another group. For
example, the objec&shy;tive might be
to examine the mean HAZ&#8209;score of city childen aged 5y with their
rural counterparts aged 5y. The sample size procedure
assumes that the distri&shy;bution of the variable in
each of the two groups will be
approximately normal.  However, the method
is statistically robust, and can
be used in most situations with more than
about 40&nbsp;individuals in each group.
Note that in this cases the effect size is the numerical difference
in the means of the two groups and that the group variance must also
be defined.
See,
<a href="https://select-statistics.co.uk/calculators/sample-size-calculator-two-means/"
target="right" >Sample size calculator - two means.</a>
However,this sample size calculator cannot be used for studies involving
more than two groups, when more sophisticated
procedures are needed to determine the sample size.
<p></p>
A practical guide to calculating the sample size is published by WHO

<span data-tippy-content="Lwanga S.K. and Lemeshow S. (1991)  Sample size determination in health studies : a practical manual.  World Health Organisation ">
(<a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/40062/9241544058_%28p1-p22%29.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y"
target="right" >Lwanga and Lemeshow, 1991</a>).</span>

The WHO guide provides tables of minimum
sample size for various study conditions
(e.g., studies involving popu&shy;lation proportion,
odds ratio, relative risk, and incidence
rate), but the tables are only valid
when the sample is selected in a statistically
random manner. For each situation in which
sample size is to be determined, the infor&shy;mation
needed is specified and at least one
illustrative example is given.
In practice, the final sample size may be constrained by
cost and logistical considerations.

<h3 id="1.4.4">  1.4.4 Collecting the data</h3>

Increasingly, digital tablets rather than paper-based forms are used for data
collection. Their use reduces the risk of
transcription errors, and can protect data security
through encryption. The transport and storage of multiple paper forms is
eliminated and costs can be reduced by the elimination of extensive data entry.
Several proprietary and open-source software options

<span data-tippy-content="Open Data Kit">
(e.g., <a href="https://opendatakit.org/"
target="right" >Open Data Kit</a>)</span>

are avail&shy;able for data collection.
Initially, data are usually collected and stored locally offline, but uploaded
on to a secure central data store when internet access is avail&shy;able.
<p></p>
The process of data aquisition, organisation, and storage should be carefully
planned in advance, with the objec&shy;tive of facilitating subsequent data handling
and analysis and minimising data entry errors &mdash; a particular problem with
dietary data.

<h3 id="1.4.5">1.4.5   Additional considerations</h3>

Of the many additional factors affecting the
design of nutritional assessment systems, the
acceptability of the method, respondent burden,
equip&shy;ment and personnel requirements,
and field survey and data processing costs are
particularly important. The methods should
be acceptable to both the target popu&shy;lation
and the staff who are performing the measure&shy;ments.
For example, in some settings,
drawing venous blood for biochem&shy;ical determinations
such as serum retinol may be
unacceptable in infants and children, whereas
the collection of breast milk samples may be
more acceptable. Similarly, collecting blood
specimens in populations with a high preva&shy;lence
of HIV infections may be perceived to
be an unacceptable risk by staff performing
the tests.
<p></p>
To reduce the nonres&shy;ponse rate and avoid
bias in the sample selec&shy;tion, the respondent
burden should be kept to a minimum. In
the U.K.&nbsp;Diet&nbsp;and Nutrition Survey,
the seven-day weighed food records were
replaced by a four-day estimated food diary,
when the rolling program was
introduced in 2008 due to concerns about
respondent burden

<span data-tippy-content="Ashwell, M., Barlow, S., Gibson, S., & Harris, C. (2006). National diet and nutri&shy;tion surveys: the British experience. Public health nutri&shy;tion, 9(4), 523–530.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16870026/"
target="right" >Ashwell et&nbsp;al., 2006</a>).</span>

Alternative methods for minimizing
the nonres&shy;ponse rate includes the offering of
material rewards and the provision of incentives
such as regular medical checkups,
feedback infor&shy;mation, social visits, and telephone
follow-up.
<p></p>
The requirements for equip&shy;ment and personnel
should also be taken into account
when designing a nutritional assessment system.
Measure&shy;ments that require elaborate
equip&shy;ment and highly trained technical staff
may be impractical in a field survey setting;
instead, the measure&shy;ments selected should
be relatively noninvasive and easy to perform
accurately and precisely using rugged
equip&shy;ment and unskilled but trained assistants.
The ease with which equip&shy;ment can
be transported to the field, maintained, and
calibrated must also be considered.
<p></p>
The field survey and data processing costs
are also important factors. Increasingly,
digital tablet devices are being used for data
collection in field surveys rather than paper-based forms.
As noted earlier, adoption of this method reduces the risk of
transcribing error, protects
data security through encryption and
reduces the cost of extensive data entry.
Several proprietary and open-source
software options are avail&shy;able, including
<a href="https://getodk.org/"
target="right" >Open Data Kit</a>,
RedCap, and Survey CTO.
Software such as Open Data Kit
permits offline data collection,
automatic encryption, and the ability to upload all
submissions when a data collection devise, such as a notebook,
is connected to the internet.
<p></p>
In surveillance systems, the resources avail&shy;able may dictate
the number of malnour&shy;ished individuals
who can subsequently be treated in an
inter&shy;vention program. When resources are scarce, the
cutoff point for the measure&shy;ment or test
(<a href="#1.5.3">Section&nbsp;1.5.3</a>)
can be lowered, a practice that simultaneously decreases sensitivity,
but increases specificity, as shown in
<a href="#table1.7">Table&nbsp;1.7</a>.
As a result, more truly
malnour&shy;ished individuals will be missed while at
the same time fewer well-nourished individuals
are misdiagnosed as malnour&shy;ished.

<h3 id="1.5"> 1.5    Important characteristics of assessment measures</h3>

All assessment measures vary in their validity, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value; these characteristics, as well as other important attributes, are discussed below,


<h3 id="1.5.1">  1.5.1 Validity</h3>

Validity is an important concept in the design
of nutritional assessment systems. It
describes the adequacy with which a measure&shy;ment
or indicator reflects what it is
intended to measure. Ideally valid measures are free from random and
system&shy;atic errors and are both sensitive and
specific
(<a href="#1.5.4">Sections&nbsp;1.5.4</a>;
<a href="#1.5.5">1.5.5</a>;
<a href="#1.5.7">1.5.7</a>;
<a href="#1.5.8">1.5.8</a>).
<p></p>
In dietary assessment, a method that provides a
valid reflection of the true &ldquo;usual
nutrient intake&rdquo; of an individual is often required.
Hence, a single weighed food
record, although the most accurate dietary assessment method, would
not provide a valid assessment of the
true &ldquo;usual nutrient intake&rdquo; of an individual,
but instead provides a measure&shy;ment of the actual intake of an
individual over one day. Similarly, if the bio&shy;marker
selected reflects &ldquo;recent&rdquo; dietary exposure, but the
study objec&shy;tive is to assess the total body store of a nutrient,
the bio&shy;marker is said to be invalid.
In the earlier U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;I survey,
thiamine and riboflavin were
analyzed in casual urine samples because it
was not practical to collect 24h urine
samples. However, the results were not indicative of body stores of thiamine or
riboflavin, and hence were considered invalid; the
determination of thiamine and riboflavin in casual urine samples were
not included in U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;II or U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III

<span data-tippy-content="Gunter, E. W., & McQuillan, G. (1990). Quality control in planning and operating the labora&shy;tory component for the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The Journal of nutri&shy;tion, 120 Suppl 11, 1451–1454.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2243286/"
target="right" >Gunter and McQuillan, 1990</a>).</span>
<p></p>
In some circum&shy;stances, assessment measures
only have &ldquo;internal&rdquo; validity, indicating
that the results are valid only for the particular
group of individuals being studied and cannot be generalized to the universe. In
contrast, if the results have &ldquo;external&rdquo; validity,
or generalizability, then the results are
valid when applied to individuals not only in
the study but in the wider universe as shown in
<a href="#figure1.6">Figure&nbsp;1.6</a>.

For example, conclusions derived from a study on
African Americans may be valid for that particular
popu&shy;lation (i.e., have internal validity) but cannot be extrapolated
to the wider American popu&shy;lation.
Internal validity is easier to achieve. It is
necessary for, but does not guarantee, external
validity. External validity requires external
quality control of the measure&shy;ments
and judgment about the degree to which the
results of a study can be extrapolated to the
wider universe. The design of any nutritional
assessment system must include consid&shy;eration
of both the internal and external validities
of the raw measure&shy;ments, the indices based
on them, and any derived indicators,
so that the findings can be
interpreted accordingly.

<h3 id="1.5.2"> 1.5.2   Reproducibility or precision</h3>

The degree to which repeated measure&shy;ments
of the same variable give the same value is
a measure of reproducibility &mdash; also referred
to as &ldquo;reliability&rdquo;
or &ldquo;precision&rdquo; in anthro&shy;pometric (Chapter 9) and laboratory
assessment (Chapter 15).  The measure&shy;ments can be repeated
on the same subject or sample by the same
individual (within-observer reproducibility)
or different individuals (between-observer
reproducibility). Alternatively, the measure&shy;ments can be assessed within
or between instruments. Reproducible measure&shy;ments yield greater
statistical power at a given sample size to
estimate mean values and to test hypotheses.
<p></p>
The study design should always include some replicate
observations (repeated but independent measure&shy;ments
on the same subject or sample). In
this way, the reproducibility of each measure&shy;ment can be calculated.
When the measure&shy;ments are continuous, the
coefficient of variation (CV%) can be calculated:

\[\small \mbox {CV %&equals; standard deviation &times; 100% / mean}\]

For categorical variables, percent agreement,
the interclass correlation coefficient,
and the kappa statistic can be used.
<p></p>
In anthro&shy;pometry, alternative methods are often
used to assess the precision of the measure&shy;ment techniques;
these are itemized in Box&nbsp;1.9, and discussed in
Chapter 9. The TEM was calculated for
each anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ment used in the WHO
Multicenter Growth Reference Study for the development of the Child Growth
Standards; see de&nbsp;Onis et&nbsp;al.

<p></p>
The reproducibility of a measure&shy;ment is a
function of the random measure&shy;ment errors
(<a href="#1.5.4">Section&nbsp;1.5.4</a>)
and, in certain cases, true variability in the
measure&shy;ment that occurs over time. For example,
the nutrient intakes of an individual
vary over time (within-person variation), and
this results in uncertainty in the estimation of
usual nutrient intake. This variation characterizes
the true &ldquo;usual intake&rdquo; of an individual.
Unfortunately, within-person variation
cannot be distinguished statistically from random
measure&shy;ment errors, irrespective of the
design of the nutritional assessment system
(see Chapter 6 for more details).
<p></p>
The precision of biochem&shy;ical measures is
similarly a function of random errors that
occur during the actual analytical process and
within-person biological variation in the biochem&shy;ical
measure. The relative importance of
these two sources of uncertainty vary with
the different measures. For many modern biochem&shy;ical
measures, the within-person biological
variation now exceeds the long-term analytical
variation, as shown in

A variety of strategies can be used to minimize random measure&shy;ment
errors and increase the reproducibility of nutritional assessment
systems. These strategies were adopted by the WHO Multicenter Growth
Reference Study, and are described in de&nbsp;Onis et&nbsp;al.

They included the following:
<ul class="padded">
<li>Compiling an operations manual that contains
specific written guide&shy;lines for taking
each measure&shy;ment, to ensure all the techniques
are standardized
<li>Training all the examiners to use the standardized
techniques consistently; the latter
is especially important in large surveys
involving multiple examiners, and in longi&shy;tudinal
studies, where maintaining standardized measure&shy;ment tech&shy;niques
during the survey is an important issue
<li>Carefully selecting and standardizing the

<li>Reducing the effect of random errors from
any source by repeating all the measure&shy;ments,

</li></ul>

<h3 id="1.5.3">1.5.3 Accuracy</h3>

The term &ldquo;accuracy&rdquo; is best used in a restricted
statistical sense to describe the extent
to which the measure&shy;ment is close to the true
value. It therefore follows that a measure&shy;ment
can be repro&shy;ducible or precise, but, at
the same time, inaccurate &mdash; a situation which
occurs when there is a system&shy;atic
bias in the measure&shy;ment (see
<a href="#figure1.7">Figure&nbsp;1.7</a> and
<a href="#1.5.5">Section&nbsp;1.5.5</a>).
The greater the system&shy;atic error or bias, the less accurate the
measure&shy;ment. Accurate measure&shy;ments, however,
necessitate high reproducibility, as shown in

<a href="#figure1.7">Figure&nbsp;1.7</a>.
<a id="figure1.7"></a>

<img src="figures/fig1.7.jpg" class="hundred" alt="Figure&nbsp;1.7">
<figcaption class="cap">

</figure>

Accuracy is not affected by sample size.
<p></p>
Several approaches exist for assessing
the accuracy of a measure&shy;ment, which vary
according to the method being used in the
nutritional assessment system. Each
approach aims to use a reference measure&shy;ment
undertaken by a technique that is
believed to best represent the true
value of the characteristic. The reference method
is termed a &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo;.
<p></p>
Assessing the accuracy of objec&shy;tive
measure&shy;ments of biochem&shy;ical bio&shy;markers
is relatively easy and
can be accomplished by using reference materials
with certified values for the nutrient of
interest, prefer&shy;ably with values that span the
concen&shy;tration range observed in the study;
see Chapter 15 for more details.

<p></p>
The control of accuracy
in other nutritional assessment methods is more
difficult and is discussed in more detail in
later chapters. For example, the correct value
of any anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ment is never
known with absolute certainty. In the absence
of absolute reference standards, the accuracy
of anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ments is assessed
by comparing them with those made by a designated
criterion anthropometrist
(<a href="#table1.5">Table&nbsp;1.5</a>).
This approach was used in the WHO
Multicenter Growth Reference Study;
see de&nbsp;Onis et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="de&nbsp;Onis, M., Onyango, A. W., Van den Broeck, J., Chumlea, W. C., & Martorell, R. (2004).

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15069917/"
target="right" >2004</a>)</span>

and Chapter 9 for more details.
<p></p>
Accurate measure&shy;ments must also be
repro&shy;ducible or precise
(<a href="#figure1.7">Figure&nbsp;1.7</a>),
as noted earlier. Therefore, the same strategies
outlined under reproducibility
(<a href="#1.5.2">Section&nbsp;1.5.2</a>)
should be adopted, with the exception of repeating the measure&shy;ments.
Additional strategies that
can also be used to enhance accuracy include
(a) making unobtrusive measure&shy;ments,
(b) blinding, and (c) calibrating the instruments.
Of these strategies, the first two should
always be used to help avoid bias where feasible
and appro&shy;priate.  An example of a strategy
based on unobtrusive measure&shy;ments to
enhance accuracy in dietary assessment is
surreptitious weighing of food portions
consumed by the partic&shy;ipants in
institutional settings such as school lunch
programs

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14595085/"
target="right" >Warren et&nbsp;al., 2003</a>)</span>.

Blinding is used in double-blind clinical trials to
ensure that neither the partic&shy;ipants nor
the researchers know in which group they
have been assigned. This strategy, although
not ensuring the overall accuracy of
the measure&shy;ments, is practiced to minimize
the possibility that the apparent effects
of the inter&shy;vention are due to
differential use of other treat&shy;ments in the inter&shy;vention
and control groups, or to biased judgement
of the outcome

The third strategy, calibrating the
instruments, should always be used when
any instruments are involved.
<p></p>
The strategies actually
adopted to maximize reproducibility and accuracy
will depend on several factors. These
may include feasibility and cost considerations,
the importance of the variable, and
the magnitude of the potential impact of the
anticipated degree of inaccuracy on the study
conclusions

<h3 id="1.5.4">1.5.4    Random errors</h3>

Random errors generate a deviation from the
correct result due to chance alone. They
lead to measure&shy;ments that are imprecise in
an unpredictable way, resulting in less certain
conclusions. They reduce the precision
of a measure&shy;ment by increasing the variability
about the mean. They do not influence the
mean or median value.
<p></p>
There are three main sources of random error:
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
<li>Individual biological variation
<li>Sampling error
<li>Measure&shy;ment error
</li></ul>

<b>Individual biological variation</b> may be a major
source of error (see <a href="#table1.4">Table&nbsp;1.4</a>).
Variability due to time of day may affect both anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ments (e.g.,
height) and biochem&shy;ical measure&shy;ments (e.g., serum iron and serum zinc). Some
nutritional bio&shy;markers also fluctuate in response to medication or meal
con&shy;sump&shy;tion; for serum zinc, for example,
variations in response to  meal con&shy;sump&shy;tion can be as much as 20%

<span data-tippy-content="King, D. G., Walker, M., Campbell, M. D., Breen, L., Stevenson, E. J., & West, D. J. (2018).

The American journal of clinical nutri&shy;tion, 107(4), 550–557. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29635505/"
target="right" >King et&nbsp;al., 2018</a>).</span>
<p></p>
<b>Sampling</b> may also be a major source of
random error. For example, significant sampling errors
may be asso&shy;ciated with the selec&shy;tion of respondents, who for practical
reasons, are usually a small subset of a
larger popu&shy;lation, or with
the collection of a particular type of food (e.g., maize porridge)
for nutrient analysis. Such errors will be present
even if the sampling is truly random. One
way to reduce this error is to increase the
sample size (i.e., the number of subjects or
the number of maize porridge samples).
<p></p>
<b>Measure&shy;ments</b> may also generate random errors.
During 24-hr dietary recall interviews, for example, a major source of
random measure&shy;ment error may be asso&shy;ciated
with the measure&shy;ment of the actual portion size
of the foods consumed (Chapter 5). Random measure&shy;ment
errors in anthro&shy;pometry may also arise from
variations during the measure&shy;ment in the compressibility of the skin
by skinfold calipers

<span data-tippy-content="Ward, R., & Anderson, G. (1993). Examination of the skinfold compressibility and skinfold thickness relationship. American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council, 5(5), 541–548. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28548383/"
target="right" >Ward and Anderson, 1993</a>)</span>

and restless infants when measuring recumbent length.
<p></p>
Random measure&shy;ment errors can be minimized
by using standardized measure&shy;ment
techniques and trained personnel and by employing
rigorous analytical quality-control procedures
during labora&shy;tory analysis. However, such
errors can never be entirely eliminated. To
be sure, random measure&shy;ment errors may
be generated when the same examiner repeats
the measure&shy;ments (within- or intra-examiner
error), or when several different examiners
repeat the same measure&shy;ment (between- or
inter-examiner error). Details of the quality control
procedures that can be incorporated to
minimize sources of measure&shy;ment
error during dietary and bio&shy;marker assessment
are included in Chapter 5 and 15, respectively.

<h3 id="1.5.5">1.5.5    Systematic errors or bias</h3>

Unfortunately, system&shy;atic errors may arise
in any nutritional assessment method, causing it to
become biased. Bias may be defined
as a condition that causes a result to depart
from the true value in a consistent direction.
The errors arising from bias reduce the accuracy
of a measure&shy;ment by altering the mean
or median value. They have no effect on
the variance and hence do not alter the reproducibility
or precision of the measure&shy;ment

<span data-tippy-content="Himes JH. (1987). Purposeful assessment of nutritional
status. In: Johnston FE (ed.) Nutritional Anthropology.

(<a href="https://www.google.com/"
target="right" >Himes, 1987</a>)</span>.
<p></p>
Several types of bias exist,
as shown in
<a href="#figure1.3">Figure&nbsp;1.3</a>.
A detailed list of sources of bias that can
affect nutri&shy;tion studies is avail&shy;able in Yetley et&nbsp;al.

<span data-tippy-content="Yetley, E. A., MacFarlane, A. J., Greene-Finestone, L. S., Garza, C., Ard, J. D., Atkinson, S. A., Bier, D. M., Carriquiry, A. L., Harlan, W. R., Hattis, D., King, J.

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927637/"
target="right" >2017a</a>),</span>

but the principal biases are selec&shy;tion bias and measure&shy;ment bias.
All types of nutritional assessment systems may experience selec&shy;tion bias.
It arises when there is a system&shy;atic difference between the
character&shy;istics of the individuals selected for
the study and the character&shy;istics of those who
are not, making it impossible to generalize
the results to the target popu&shy;lation. Selec&shy;tion
bias may originate in a variety of ways. Some
of these are outlined in Box&nbsp;1.10.

<div class="box">
<b>Box&nbsp;1.10: Various types of selec&shy;tion bias</b>
<ul class="padded">
<li>Self-selec&shy;tion bias results from studying only
volunteers for a study, who perhaps volunteer because
they are unwell.
<li>Referral bias will be present if cases are recruited
through a district health center but controls from
an adjacent village.
<li>nonres&shy;ponse bias is caused by ignoring people
who do not respond to an initial attempt to include
them in the study.
<li>Diagnostic bias arises from selecting subjects for
a multicenter case-control study using different
diagnostic criteria in different centers.
<li>Drop-out bias is usually the result of ignoring
possible system&shy;atic differences between those
who fail to complete a study and the remaining
partic&shy;ipants.
</li></ul></div>
Wherever possible, a strategy should be
used to obtain infor&shy;mation on people who
refuse to participate or subsequently fail to
complete the study. This infor&shy;mation can
then be used to assess whether those who did
not participate or dropped out of the study are
similar to the partic&shy;ipants. If they differ, then
a selec&shy;tion bias is present.
<p></p>
Measure&shy;ment bias can be introduced in a
variety of ways. For example:
<p></p>
<b>Biased equip&shy;ment</b> may over- or under&shy;estimate
weight or height. Alternatively,
skinfold calipers may systematically over- or
under-estimate skinfold thickness because
of differences in the degree of compression
arising from the magnitude of the jaw pressure.
<p></p>
<b>Analytical bias</b> may result from the use of
a biochem&shy;ical method that systematically
under- or overestimates the nutrient content
of a food or biological specimen. For example,
vitamin&nbsp;C may be under&shy;estimated because
only the reduced form of vitamin&nbsp;C,
and not total vitamin&nbsp;C, is measured.
Alternatively, if the biopsy specimens of the
treat&shy;ment and control groups are
analyzed in different laboratories
which produce systematically different results for
the same assay, then the assay results will be biased.	
<p></p>
<b>Social desirability bias</b> occurs, for example,
when respondents under&shy;estimate their
alcohol con&shy;sump&shy;tion in a 24h food recall or record.
However, scales can be used to measure
the extent of the bias

<span data-tippy-content="Robinson JP, Shaver PR, Wrightsman LS. (1991). Measures
of Personality and Social Psychological Attitudes.

including the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13813058/"
target="right" >Crowne and Marlowe, 1960</a>).</span>

<p></p>
<b>Interviewer bias</b> arises when interviewers
differ in the way in which they obtain,
record, process, and interpret infor&shy;mation.
This is a particular problem if different interviewers
are assigned different segments
of the popu&shy;lation, such as different racial
or age groups.
<p></p>
<b>Recall bias</b> is a form of measure&shy;ment bias
of critical importance in retrospective case control
studies. In such studies, there
may be differential recall of infor&shy;mation
by cases and controls. For example, persons
with heart disease will be more likely
to recall past exposure to saturated fat than
the controls, as saturated fat is widely
known to be asso&shy;ciated with heart disease.
Such a recall bias may exaggerate the
degree of effect of association with the exposure
or, alternatively, may under&shy;estimate
the association if the cases are more likely
than controls to deny past exposure.
<p></p>
Bias is important as it cannot be removed by
subsequent statistical analysis. Consequently,
care must be taken to reduce and, if possible,
eliminate all sources of bias in the nutritional
assessment system by the choice of an appro&shy;priate
design and careful attention to the
equip&shy;ment and methods selected. Strategies
for controlling bias and its potential effect on
the measure&shy;ment of a cause-effect relationship
are described in most standard epidemio&shy;logical
texts; see Hulley et&nbsp;al.

assess the risk of bias depending on
the type of study (i.e., RCT, cohort,

<h3 id="1.5.6">1.5.6    Confounding</h3>

Confounding is a special type of bias that
can affect the validity of a study: it
masks the true effect. A confounding variable
is defined as a characteristic or variable
that is associated with the problem and with a possible cause of the problem. See Howards

<span data-tippy-content="Howards P. P. (2018a). An overview of confounding. Part 1: the concept and how to address it. Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica, 97(4), 394–399.">

<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29341101/"
target="right" >2018b</a>)</span>.

Such a characteristic or variable may either strengthen or weaken the apparent relationship between the problem and possible cause.
Three conditions must exist for confounding to occur. These are:
<ul class="padded">
<li>
Confounding factor must be associated with
both the risk factor of interest and the outcome;
<li>
Confounding factor must be distributed unequally among the groups being compared;
<li>
A confounder cannot be an intermediary step in the causal pathway
from the exposure of interest to the outcome of interest.
</li></ul>
<p></p>
Examples of confounders in epidemio&shy;logical
studies often include age, gender, and social class.
In the example shown in
<a href="#figure1.8">Figure&nbsp;1.8</a>,
cigarette smoking confounds the apparent relationship
between coffee con&shy;sump&shy;tion and coronary
heart disease and is thus said to be the
confounding variable. The latter arises because
persons who consume coffee are more
likely to smoke than people who do not drink
coffee, and cigarette smoking is known to be
a cause of coronary heart disease

Some authors have drawn a distinction between
confounders and other variables that
may also influence outcome. The latter include
outcome modifiers and effect modifiers.
Outcome modifiers have an effect on
the health outcome independent of the exposure
of interest.
<p></p>
Effect modifiers, in contrast, modify (positively
or negatively) the effect of the hypothesized
causal variables. Hence, unlike
confounders and outcome modifiers, effect
modifiers do lie on the causal pathway relating
the exposure of interest to the outcome.
As an example, hyper&shy;tension is more frequent
among African Americans than among Caucasians,
whereas the preva&shy;lence of coronary
heart disease is higher among Caucasians
than among African Americans. Hence, some
variable possibly related to lifestyle or constitution
may modify the effect of
hyper&shy;tension on coronary heart disease.
The number of participants needed to study effect modification
is generally large, and as a consequence many studies are not
powered to detect effect modification. For more details,
see Newman et&nbsp;al. in Hulley et al.

Chapter 9.

<p></p>
Several strategies exist to control for confounders, provided they are
known and measured. They can be applied
at the design or at the analysis
stage, although confounding by unmeasured factors
may still remain. In large studies, it is preferable
to control for confounding at the analysis stage.
<p></p>
Strategies at the design stage include
randomization to minimize the influence of baseline confounding variables,
and blinding to control a biased judgement of the outcome (for RCTs only)
(<a href="#1.5.5">Section&nbsp;1.5.5</a>).
Alternatively, for observational studies, restriction and matching can be used,
also at the design stage; both involve changes in the sampling to ensure that
only groups with similar levels of the confounders are compared.
<p></p>
<b>Restriction,</b> the simplest strategy,
involves designing inclusion criteria
that specify a value for the potential
confounding variable, and exclude everyone
with a different value. In the example
depicted in
<a href="#figure1.8">Figure&nbsp;1.8</a>,
if restriction was applied to avoid confounding, only nonsmokers would
be included in the study design so that any
association between coffee and heart disease
could not be due to smoking.
However, such a restriction would compromise the
ability to generalize the findings to smokers,
and sometimes may adversely affect recruitment,
and thus the final sample size.
<p></p>
<b>Matching</b> is another strategy commonly used
to control for confounding. It involves selecting individually
cases and controls with the same
matching values of the confounding variable(s).
Both pair-wise matching and matching
in groups (i.e., frequency matching) can be
used.  Unlike restriction, because
partic&shy;ipants at all levels of the confounder are
studied, generalizability is not compromised
in matching. In the
<a href="#figure1.8">Figure&nbsp;1.8</a>,
when applying a case-control design, each case
(i.e., person with heart disease) would be
individually matched to one or more controls
who smoked about the same number
of cigarettes per day (i.e., pair-wise matching). The coffee
drinking of each case would then be compared with that of the
matched control. In some circum&shy;stances
confounding variables can be controlled in
the design phase without measuring them;
these are termed &ldquo;oppor&shy;tunistic
obser&shy;vational designs&rdquo;. For details, see Hulley et&nbsp;al.

Alternatively, when controlling for confounders at
the analysis stage, potential confounders
are not prespecified. Three strategies
are avail&shy;able: stratification; statistical
modeling; and propensity scores. For
stratification, subjects are segregated
into strata according to the level of a potential
confounder, after which the relation
between the predictor and outcome in each
stratum are examined separately.
Stratification is often limited by the size of the
study, and the limited number of
covariates that can be controlled simultaneously. In
such cases, statistical modeling (multi&shy;variate)
can be used to control multiple
confounders simultaneously; a range of
statistical techniques are avail&shy;able.
<p></p>
Propensity scores are used in observational studies to
estimate the effect of a treat&shy;ment on an outcome when
selec&shy;tion bias due to nonrandom treat&shy;ment assignment is likely.
By creating a propensity score, the goal is
to balance covariates between individuals who
did and did not receive a treat&shy;ment, making it easier
to isolate the effect of a treat&shy;ment;
see Garrido et&nbsp;al.

<h3 id="1.5.7">1.5.7 Sensitivity</h3>

The sensitivity of a test or indicator refers
to the extent to which it reflects nutritional
status or predicts changes in nutriture. Sensitive
tests (or indicators) show large changes
as a result of only small changes in nutritional
status. As a result, they have the ability
to identify and classify those persons within a
popu&shy;lation who are genuinely malnour&shy;ished.
<p></p>
Some variables are strictly homeo&shy;statically controlled,
and hence have very poor
sensitivity. An example is shown in	
<a href="#figure1.9">Figure&nbsp;1.9</a>

that displays the hypothetical
relationship between mean plasma vitamin&nbsp;A
and liver vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;trations.
Note that plasma retinol concen&shy;trations
reflect the vitamin&nbsp;A status only when liver
vitamin&nbsp;A stores are severely
depleted (&lt;&nbsp;0.07&micro;mol/g liver) or excessively high
(&gt;&nbsp;1.05&micro;mol/g liver). When liver vitamin&nbsp;A
concen&shy;trations are within these limits,
plasma retinol concen&shy;trations are
homeo&shy;statically controlled and levels remain
relatively constant and do not reflect
total body reserves of vitamin&nbsp;A. Therefore,
in populations from higher income
countries where liver vitamin&nbsp;A concen&shy;trations
are generally within these limits,
the usefulness of plasma retinol as a sensitive
bio&shy;marker of vitamin&nbsp;A exposure and status is limited.
<p></p>
Likewise, the use of serum zinc as a bio&shy;marker of exposure or status at the
<i>individual</i> level is limited due to tight homeostatic control mechanisms. For
example, doubling the intake of zinc increases plasma zinc concen&shy;trations by only
6% according to a recent meta-analysis

<span data-tippy-content="King JC. (2018). Yet again,

<p></p>
An index (or indicator) with 100% sensitivity
correctly identifies all those individuals
who are genuinely malnour&shy;ished: no malnour&shy;ished
persons are classified as &ldquo;well&rdquo;
(i.e., there are no false negatives).
Numerically, sensitivity (S<sub>e</sub>) the proportion
of individuals with malnu&shy;trition who
have positive tests (true positives divided by
the sum of true positives and false negatives).
The sensitivity of a test (or indicator)
changes with preva&shy;lence, as well as with
the cutoff point, as discussed in
<a href="#1.6.3">Section&nbsp;1.6.3</a>.
<p></p>
Unfortunately, the term &ldquo;sensitivity&rdquo; is also
used to describe the ability of an analytical
method to detect the substance of interest.
The term &ldquo;analytical sensitivity&rdquo; should be
used in this latter context (Chapter&nbsp;15).

<h3 id="1.5.8">1.5.8 Specificity</h3>

The specificity of a test (or indicator)
refers to the ability of the test (or indicator)
to identify and classify those persons who are
genuinely well nourished. If a measure&shy;ment (or indicator)
has 100% specificity, all genuinely
well-nourished individuals will be correctly
identified: no well-nourished individuals will
be classified as &ldquo;ill&rdquo; (i.e., there are no false
positives). Numerically, specificity (S<sub>p</sub>) is
the proportion of individuals without malnu&shy;trition
who have negative tests (true negatives
divided by the sum of true negatives and false
positives).

describes the four situations that
are possible when evaluating the performance
of a test or indicator. These are a true positive
(TP) result: the test is positive and
the person really has, for example, anemia;
a false-positive (FP) result: the test is positive
but the person does not, for example,
have anemia; a false-negative (FN) result: the
test is negative but the person genuinely has
anemia: and a true-negative (TN) result: the
test is negative and the person does not have
anemia. Increasingly in nutritional assessment,
the performance of tests, and their asso&shy;ciated indicators
are being evaluated by
calculating sensitivity and specificity, as well as predictive value
(<a href="#1.5.10">Section&nbsp;1.5.10</a>).
<p></p>
It is important to note that sensitivity and
specificity only provide infor&shy;mation on the
proportion or percentage of persons with or
without malnu&shy;trition who are correctly categorized.
These measures do not predict the
actual number of persons who will be categorized
as malnour&shy;ished. The actual number
of persons will depend on the frequency of
malnu&shy;trition in the group being studied.
<p></p>
The ideal test has a low number of both
false positives (high specificity) and false
negatives (high sensitivity), and hence the test
is able to completely separate those who genuinely
are malnour&shy;ished from persons who
are healthy. In practice, a balance has to be struck
between specificity and sensitivity, depending
on the consequences of identifying false
negatives and false positives. For example,
for a serious condition such as screening for
neonatal phenylketonuria, it might be preferable
to have high sensitivity and to accept
the increased cost of a high number of false
positives (reduced specificity). In such circum&shy;stances,
follow-up would be required to
identify the true positives and true negatives.
<p></p>
<b>Factors modifying sensitivity and specificity</b>
<p></p>
<b>Cutoff points</b> have an effect on both sensitivity
and specificity. In cases where lower values
of the measure are asso&shy;ciated with malnu&shy;trition
(e.g., hemoglobin), decreasing the cutoff
point decreases sensitivity but increases
specificity for a given test. Conversely, increasing
the cutoff will increase sensitivity
but decrease specificity.

illustrates this inverse
relation between sensitivity and specificity.

<b>Extent of the random errors</b> asso&shy;ciated with
the raw measure&shy;ments influence the specificity

strategies do exist to minimize them, as noted earlier
(<a href="#1.5.4">Section&nbsp;1.5.4</a>).
<p></p>
<b>Non-nutritional factors</b> such as inflam&shy;mation,
diurnal variation, and the effects of disease
may reduce the specificity

For example, inflam&shy;mation is known to
decrease concen&shy;trations of serum iron, serum retinol,
serum retinol binding protein,
and serum zinc, while increasing serum ferritin
and serum copper

As a result, the tests yield values which do
not reflect true iron, vitamin&nbsp;A or zinc status, so misclassification
occurs; individuals are designated &ldquo;at
risk&rdquo; to low concen&shy;trations of
serum iron, retinol, retinol binding protein, and serum
zinc, when they are actually unaffected (false positives).
In contrast, inflam&shy;mation increases serum ferritin and serum copper,
so that in this case individuals may be
designated &ldquo;not at risk&rdquo; when they are truly
affected by the condition (false negatives).

A new regression modeling approach has been developed to adjust serum

Other disease processes may also alter the nutrient status, and in turn, the

<b>Biological and behavioral processes</b> that relate
the indicator to the outcomes may influence
sensitivity and specificity.
The sensitivity of low birth weight as an indicator
of neonatal mortality will be greater in
settings where it is due largely to prematurity
rather than to intrauterine growth retardation.	
The sensitivity or specificity of dietary intake data collected
during 24hr interviews may be affected by behavioral effects.
Participants have admitted in postsurvey focus group
interviews to altering their eating patterns;
reasons include inconvenience, embarrassment and
guilt

<h3 id="1.5.9">1.5.9    Prevalence</h3>

The number of persons with malnu&shy;trition or
disease during a given time period is measured
by the preva&shy;lence. Numerically, the
actual preva&shy;lence (P) is the proportion of
individuals who really are malnour&shy;ished or
infected with the disease in question (the
sum of true positives and false negatives) divided
by the sample popu&shy;lation (the sum of
true positives, false positives, true negatives,
and false negatives)
(<a href="#table1.6">Table&nbsp;1.6</a>).
<p></p>
Prevalence influences the predictive value
of a nutritional index more than any other
factor (see Section <a href="#1.5.10">1.5.10</a>).
For example, when the
preva&shy;lence of malnu&shy;trition such as anemia
decreases, it becomes less likely that an individual
with a positive test (i.e., low hemoglobin)
actually has anemia and more likely
that the test represents a false positive. Therefore,
the lower the preva&shy;lence of the condition,
the more specific a test must be to
be clinically useful

<h3 id="1.5.10">1.5.10   Predictive value</h3>

The predictive value can be defined as the
likelihood that a test correctly predicts the
presence or absence of malnu&shy;trition or disease.
Numerically, the predictive value of
a test is the proportion of all tests that are
true (the sum of the true positives and true
negatives divided by the total number of tests)
(<a href="#table1.6">Table&nbsp;1.6</a>).
Because it incorporates infor&shy;mation
on both the test and the popu&shy;lation being
tested, predictive value is a good measure of
overall clinical usefulness.
<p></p>
The predictive value can be further subdivided
into the positive predictive value and
the negative predictive value, as shown in
<a href="#table1.6">Table&nbsp;1.6</a>.
The positive predictive value of
a test is the proportion of positive tests that
are true (the true positives divided by the sum
of the true positives and false positives). The
negative predictive value of a test is the proportion
of negative tests that are true (the true
negatives divided by the sum of the true negatives
and false negatives). In other words, positive
predictive value is the probability of the person
having malnu&shy;trition or a disease
when the test is positive, whereas negative
predictive value is the probability of the
person not having malnu&shy;trition or
disease when the test is negative.
<p></p>
The predictive value of any test is not
constant but depends on the sensitivity and
specificity of the test, and most
importantly, on the preva&shy;lence of malnu&shy;trition
or disease in the popu&shy;lation being tested.

<a href="#table1.9">Table&nbsp;1.9</a> shows the influence of preva&shy;lence
on the positive predictive value of an
index when the sensitivity and specificity are
constant. When the preva&shy;lence of malnu&shy;trition
is low, even very sensitive and specific
tests have a relatively low positive predictive
value. Conversely, when the preva&shy;lence of
malnu&shy;trition is high, tests with rather low
sensitivity and specificity may have a relatively
high positive predictive value

The predictive value is the best indicator of
the usefulness of any test of nutritional status
in a particular circumstance. An acceptable
predictive value for any test depends on the
number of false-negative and false-positive
results that are considered tolerable, taking
into account the preva&shy;lence of the disease
or malnu&shy;trition, its severity, the cost of the
test, and, where appro&shy;priate, the availability
and advantages of treat&shy;ment. In general,
the highest predictive value is achieved when
specificity is high, irrespective of sensitivity

Sometimes, labora&shy;tory measure&shy;ments are
combined with measure&shy;ments of nutrient intakes
and anthro&shy;pometric measure&shy;ments to
form a multiparameter index with an enhanced
predictive value. Several examples
of multiparameter indices used to identify
malnour&shy;ished hospital patients and predict

in detail in Chapter&nbsp;27. Of these, the
Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), developed by

Increasingly, multiparameter indices based on three nutritional
biomarkers of iron status (in combination with CRP and
AGP &mdash; biomarkers of inflammation) are being used to identify
iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia at the
individual and population level.
The biomarkers recommended include serum ferritin,
soluble transferrin receptor, and hemoglobin

<h3 id="1.6">1.6   Evaluation of nutritional assessment indices</h3>

In popu&shy;lation studies, nutritional assessment
indices can be evaluated by comparison with
a distri&shy;bution of reference values from a healthy population (if avail&shy;able)
using percen&shy;tiles, standard deviation
scores (Z&#8209;scores), and in some cases,
percent-of-median (See Chapter&nbsp;13 for more details). Alternatively,
for classifying individuals, the values
for nutritional assessment indices can
be compared with either statistically pre&shy;deter&shy;mined reference
limits drawn from the reference distri&shy;bution for a healthy population
or cutoff points. The latter are based
on data that relate the levels of the indices
to low body stores of the nutrient, impaired
function, clinical signs of deficiency, morbidity or mortality.
Sometimes, more than one reference
limit or cutoff point is used to define degrees
of malnu&shy;trition (e.g., undernutrition, overweight, obesity with body mass
index) (Chapters&nbsp;9 and&nbsp;10).

<h3 id="1.6.1">1.6.1    Reference distri&shy;bution</h3>

For comparison of the observed values at the

Frequently, these factors include age, sex, race,
and physio&shy;logical state, and, depending on
the variable, they may also include exercise,
body posture, and fasting status.

<h3 id="1.6.2">1.6.2   Reference limits</h3>

The reference distri&shy;bution can also be used to
derive reference limits and a reference interval.
Reference limits are generally defined
so that a stated fraction of the reference values
would be less than or equal to the limit,
with a stated probability. Two reference limits
may be defined statistically, and the interval between
and including them is termed the &ldquo;reference
interval&rdquo;. Statistically, the reference interval
is often the central 95% of a normal
reference distri&shy;bution, and is assumed to
represent a normal range.  Observed
values for individuals can then be classified as &ldquo;unusually low&rdquo;,
&ldquo;usual&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unusually high,&rdquo; according to
whether they are situated below the lower reference
limit, between or equal to either of the
reference limits, or above the upper reference limit

<span data-tippy-content="International Federation of Clinical Chemistry, Scientific Committee, Clinical Section. Expert Panel on Theory of Reference Values (EPTRV). The theory of reference values.

<p></p>
In low income countries, reference limits for anthro&shy;pometric
growth indices based on Z&#8209;scores are preferred, with Z&#8209;scores
below &minus;2 or above &plus;2 often used as the
reference limits.
to designate individuals with either unusually low or unusually
high anthropometric indices. When this approach is used,
theoretically the proportion of children with a Z&#8209;score
less than &minus;2 or greater than &plus;2 in a study population
should be about 2.3%.
Clearly, if the proportion in the study population with
such low or high Z-scores is significantly greater than this,
then the study population is seriously affected,
as shown in <a href="#figure1.10">Figure&nbsp;1.10</a>.
The use of Z&#8209;scores  is recom&shy;mended in
low income countries because Z&#8209;scores can be
calculated accurately beyond the limits of
the original reference data. In contrast, in industrialized countries, the
3<sup>rd</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup>
or 97<sup>th</sup> percen&shy;tiles are frequently
the reference limits used to designate
individuals with unusually low or unusually
high anthro&shy;pometric growth indices.
<p></p>
Often for biochem&shy;ical indices, only a lower
reference limit is defined. In U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III,
the lower reference limit for hemoglobin corresponded
to the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile
of the &ldquo;true&rdquo; healthy reference distribution of
the U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;III (1988&ndash;1991) survey, whereas for serum zinc,
the lower reference limits (by age, sex, fasting status,
and time of blood collection) are based on the 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile values from a &ldquo;true&rdquo; healthy reference sample derived from U.S.&nbsp;NHANES&nbsp;II
(1976&ndash;1980). See Chapter 24 and Hotz et&nbsp;al.

Note that the terms &ldquo;abnormal,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;pathological&rdquo; should
not be applied when using this statistical approach for

not necessarily asso&shy;ciated with any impairment
in health status

<h3 id="1.6.3">1.6.3 Cutoff points </h3>

Cutoff points, unlike statistically defined reference limits, are
based on the relationship between nutritional
assessment indices and low body stores, functional
impairment, or clinical signs of deficiency
or excess, as noted earlier

<span data-tippy-content="Raghavan, R., Ashour, F. S., & Bailey, R. (2016). A Review of Cutoffs for Nutritional Bio&shy;markers. Advances in nutri&shy;tion (Bethesda, Md.), 7(1), 112–120.">

evidence that excess weight is associated with an increased
incidence of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, stroke, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, and
some cancers

Cutoff points may vary with the
local setting because the relationship between
the nutritional indices and functional outcomes is unlikely
to be the same from area to area.
<p></p>
Cutoff points, like reference limits, are
often age-, race-, or sex-specific, depending
on the index. They must also take into account
the precision of the measure&shy;ment.
Poor precision affects the sensitivity
(<a href="#1.5.7">Section&nbsp;1.5.7</a>)
and specificity
(<a href="#1.5.8">Section&nbsp;1.5.8</a>)
of the measure&shy;ment, and leads to an overlap between those individuals
classified as having low or deficient values
with those having normal values. This results in misclassification of individuals.
<p></p>
Sometimes more than one cutoff point is selected.
For example, several cutoffs
based on body mass index (BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup>)
are used to classify the severity of
over&shy;nutrition in adults (see Chapter 10), whereas
for serum vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> two cutoffs
asso&shy;ciated with vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>
deficiency or depletion have been defined

When selecting an index and its asso&shy;ciated
cutoff point, the relative importance
of the sensitivity and specificity of the nutritional
index (or indicator) must always be
considered, as noted earlier
(<a href="#1.5.7">Sections&nbsp;1.5.7</a>,
<a href="#1.5.8">1.5.8</a>).
Receiver operator characteristic
(ROC) curves are often used to select cutoff
points. This is a graphical method of comparing
indices and portraying the trade-offs that
occur in the sensitivity and specificity of a test
when the cutoffs are altered. To use this approach,
a spectrum of cutoffs or thresholds
over the observed range of results is required
and the sensitivity and specificity for each
cutoff calculated. Next, the sensitivity (or
true-positive rate) is plotted on the vertical axis against the true negative
rate (1.0&minus;specificity) on the horizontal axis for each
of the three cutoff points as shown in
<a href="#figure1.12"> Figure&nbsp;1.12</a>.

The closer the curve follows the left-hand border
and then the top-border of the
ROC space, the more accurate is the
bio&shy;marker cutoff in distinguishing a
deficiency from optimal status. The optimal
ROC curve is the line connecting the
points highest and farthest to the left of the upper corner.
The closer the curve
comes to the 45&deg; diagonal of the ROC space,
the less accurate the bio&shy;marker
cutoff.  Most statistical programs (e.g., SPSS) provide
some sort of ROC curve analysis

<p></p>
The area under the ROC curve (AUC),
also known as the cut-point &ldquo;c&rdquo;&nbsp;statistic or
c&nbsp;index, is a commonly used summary
measure of the accuracy of the cutoff for the
nutritional assessment index of interest.
AUCs can range from&nbsp;0.5 (random chance,
or no predictive ability); this follows the 45&deg; line in the ROC plot, see
(<a href="#figure1.10">Figure&nbsp;1.10</a>)
to &gt;&nbsp;0.75 (good), and &gt;&nbsp;0.9 (excellent).
The cutoff value that provides the highest
sensitivity and specificity is calculated.
On the rare occasions that the estimated
AUC for the index cutoff is &lt;&nbsp;0.5,
then the index cutoff is worse than chance. When
multiple indices are avail&shy;able for the same nutrient,
the index with the highest
AUC is often selected.
<p></p>
The Youden index (J) is another main summary
statistic of the ROC curve. It
defines the maximum potential effectiveness
of a bio&shy;marker. J can be defined as:

\[\small \mbox {J &equals; (maximum sensitivity (c)
&plus; specificity (c)&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1}\]

The cutoff that achieves the
maximum is referred to as the optimal cutoff (c*)
because it is the cutoff that
optimizes the bio&shy;marker’s differen&shy;tiating ability
when equal weight is given to
sensitivity and specificity.  J can range from 0 to 1,
with values closer to 1
indicating a perfect diagnostic test
and values closer to 0 signifying a limited
effectiveness. For more details, see
Schisterman et&nbsp;al.

Misclassification arises when there is overlap
between individuals who actually
have the deficiency (or excess) and those
falsely identified (i.e., false positives).
Neither reference limits nor cutoff values
can separate the &ldquo;deficient&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;adequately nourished&rdquo;
without some misclassification occurring. This is shown in
<a href="#figure1.13"> Figure&nbsp;1.13</a>

for the real-life situation (B).
<p></p>
Note that the final selec&shy;tion of the
cutoff values may vary depending on whether
the consequences of a high number of
individuals being classified as false positive
is more or less important than the
consequences of a large number of individuals
being classified as false negatives.
Minimizing either misclassification may be
considered more important than
minimizing the total number of individuals
misclassified.
<p></p>
Note that the sensitivity can be improved
(i.e., reducing the false positives) by
moving the cutoff to the right, but this
reduces the specificity (false negatives),
whereas moving the cutoff to the left reduces
the false negatives (higher
specificity) at the cost of a reduction in sensitivity.
The former scenario may be
preferred for the clinical diagnosis of a
fatal condition, whereas cutoffs with a high
specificity may be preferred for
diagnostic tests that are invasive or expensive.
<p></p>
Misclassification arises because there is
always biological variation among
individuals (and hence in the physio&shy;logical
normal levels defined by the index),
depending on their nutrient requirements

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3796904/"
target="right" >Beaton, 1986</a>).</span>

As well, for many bio&shy;markers there is high within-person
variation, which influences both the
sensitivity and specificity of the index,
as well as the popu&shy;lation preva&shy;lence
estimates. These estimates can be more
accurately determined if the effect of
within-person variation is taken into account.
This can only be done by obtaining
repeated measure&shy;ments of the index
for each individual, which for invasive
biochem&shy;ical bio&shy;markers, is often not feasible .
<p></p>
<a href="#figure1.13"> Figure&nbsp;1.13</a>	
illustrates the problem of misclassification. In this figure,
the light-shaded area to the right of
110g/L and below the left curve represents
anemic persons classified as normal according
to the cutoff point (110g/L) defined by
the World Health Organization

<span data-tippy-content="WHO (World Health Organization). (1972). Nutritional
Anemia. Technical Report Series No. 3.

target="right" >WHO, 1972</a>).</span>

The dark-shaded area to the left of 110g/L
and below the right curve comprises persons
within the normal popu&shy;lation, classified as
anemic by the WHO cutoff point but who were
not found to be responsive to iron administration.
Hence, the dark-shaded area represents
those well-nourished persons who were incorrectly
classified as &ldquo;anemic&rdquo; (i.e., false
positives).

<h3 id="1.6.4">1.6.4    Trigger levels for surveillance
and public health decision making</h3>

In popu&shy;lation studies, cutoff points may be
combined with trigger levels to set the level
of an index (or indicator) or combination of
indices at which a public health problem exists
of a specified level of concern. Trigger
levels may highlight regions or populations,
where specific nutrient deficiencies are likely
to occur, or may serve to monitor and evaluate inter&shy;vention programs.
They should, however, be interpreted with caution
because they have not necessarily been
validated in popu&shy;lation-based surveys.

As an example, the WHO and UNICEF have classified the
severity of malnu&shy;trition
in young children age &lt;&nbsp;60mos into
five thresholds based on the preva&shy;lence (as&nbsp;%)
of wasting (i.e., weight-for-length/height
&lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;scores),
overweight (weight-for-age &gt;&nbsp;&plus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;scores),
and stunting (length/height-for-age &lt;&nbsp;&minus;2&nbsp;Z&#8209;scores) for
targeting purposes

The number of countries (i.e. &ldquo;n&rdquo;) in each of the
different threshold categories, based on data from the WHO 2018 Global Database
on Child Growth and Malnutrition, are also shown

Comparison of the preva&shy;lence estimates for each anthro&shy;pometric
indicator can trigger countries to
identify the most appro&shy;priate inter&shy;vention program to
achieve &ldquo;low&rdquo; or &ldquo;very low&rdquo; preva&shy;lence threshold levels.
Trigger levels for zinc bio&shy;markers have been set by the
Inter&shy;national Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group. (Box 1.12)
Note that ideally, all three types of indicators
should be used together to obtain the
best estimate of the risk of zinc
deficiency in a popu&shy;lation and to identify specific
sub-groups with elevated risk
