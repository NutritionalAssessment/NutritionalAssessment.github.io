Vitamin&nbsp;D is a&nbsp;generic term for a&nbsp;group of related
sub&shy;stances, includ&shy;ing vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub>
(ergo&shy;cal&shy;ciferol) and
vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> (chole&shy;cal&shy;ciferol).
It is a&nbsp;precursor to the
steroid hormone 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D (calcitriol)
that helps the body absorb and
retain calcium and phosphorus, thus contributing to bone health.
Deficiencies in vitamin&nbsp;D may cause rickets, osteomalacia and
osteoporosis.  Sun-mediated synthesis of vitamin&nbsp;D in the skin may be
important in lower latitudes, but in settings where this synthesis is not significant,
vitamin&nbsp;D is an essential nutrient.
As vitamin&nbsp;D is a&nbsp;fat-soluble vitamin,
deficiencies may be caused by malabsorption syndromes.
Exposure and status of vitamin&nbsp;D is assessed by measuring
the concen&shy;tration of the transport metabolite,
25&#8209;hydroxyvitamin&nbsp;D, that reflects both ingested and
skin-synthesized sources.  1,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D (calcitriol)
is not a&nbsp;measure of vitamin&nbsp;D status as
levels in blood reflect temporary stimulation and
not nutrient stores. Other measures of vitamin&nbsp;D status 	
include factors and molecules related to its
role in bone development; little is known
about specific biomarkers of the nonskeletal roles of vitamin&nbsp;D

<h2>18b   Vitamin&nbsp;D</h2>

Vitamin&nbsp;D (calciferol) is a&nbsp;generic term for a&nbsp;group of related
fat-soluble sub&shy;stances, includ&shy;ing
vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> (ergo&shy;cal&shy;ciferol), vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub>
(chole&shy;cal&shy;ciferol) and their meta&shy;bolites
(<a href="#figure18b.1">Figure&nbsp;18b.1</a>).

</figure>	
Vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> is
derived from the plant sterol, ergo&shy;sterol, and is the form used to
fortify vegan foods and in some high-dosage pharma&shy;ceut&shy;ical
prep&shy;ar&shy;ations. Vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub>
originates from the action of ultra&shy;violet B
(UVB) rays from sunlight or artificial sources on its precursor sterol,
7-dehydrochol&shy;esterol.  This is present in the skin and some animal-based diet&shy;ary sources, including some fish liver oils,
the flesh of fatty fish, eggs, and organ meats.  Foods may be
fort&shy;ified with vitamin&nbsp;D (e.g., milk, cereals, bread, margarine)
in some countries

<h2 id="18.1" >18b.1 Functions of vitamin&nbsp;D</h2>

<p>
The active form of vitamin&nbsp;D, 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D (calcitriol), primarily func&shy;tions as a&nbsp;steroid hor&shy;mone,
ensuring ade&shy;quate intest&shy;inal absorption of calcium and phos&shy;phorus and
regul&shy;ating bone mineral&shy;ization.  In this role, the pathway of syn&shy;thesis of
the active form  1,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D (calcitriol), is endo&shy;crine as it is made in a&nbsp;tissue
only when it is required, then circulates to target tissues, where
it is present for only a&nbsp;short period of time.
</p>
<p>
Vitamin&nbsp;D also has a&nbsp;critical role in a&nbsp;number of cellular func&shy;tions in
many tissues in the body, includ&shy;ing bone, placenta, prostate,
keratin&shy;ocytes, macro&shy;phages, T-lympho&shy;cytes, dendritic cells, para&shy;thyroid gland and some cancers
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Wacker M, Holick MF.  (2013). vitamin&nbsp;D &mdash; effects on

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23306192/"
target="right" >Wacker and Holick, 2013</a>).</span>
The active meta&shy;bolite 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D (calcitriol)
is involved in modulating the immune res&shy;ponse and in regu&shy;lating cell
differ&shy;entiation, pro&shy;lifer&shy;ation, and apoptosis

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18689389/"
target="right" >Norman, 2008</a>).</span>		
In these non-skel&shy;etal roles, the pathway of syn&shy;thesis of this active
form is autocrine / paracrine, whereby the active form stays in the cell or is
trans&shy;ported locally.


<h2 id="18b.2" >18b.2 Metabolism of vitamin&nbsp;D</h2>

Vitamin&nbsp;D can be obtained in two ways: from skin synthesis of
vitamin&nbsp;D3 (cholecalciferol) and from ingestion of the parent compounds (D2 (ergocalciferol) or
D3) from foods or supplements. This situation creates problems
in assessing vitamin&nbsp;D status as dietary intake alone is not
sufficient to gauge risk for deficiency. Sun exposure along with
behavioural and environmental factors affecting skin synthesis
must also be taken into account.


<h3 id="18b.2.1" >18b.2.1 Skin syn&shy;thesis of vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3 </sub> (cholecalciferol)</h3>
<p>
The require&shy;ment for vitamin&nbsp;D can be met by skin syn&shy;thesis alone
provided UVB can reach the skin.  The syn&shy;thesis of vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> in the
skin involves two stages: the photochem&shy;ical transform&shy;ation of
7-dehydrochol&shy;esterol to pre&shy;vit&shy;amin D<sub>3</sub> by UVB, followed by thermal
isomerization of the pre&shy;vit&shy;amin to vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol).
Variables influ&shy;enc&shy;ing the form&shy;ation of pre&shy;vit&shy;amin D<sub>3</sub> in the skin
include skin pig&shy;ment&shy;ation, the intensity of the solar ultra&shy;violet
light, and envi&shy;ron&shy;mental factors such as clouds, smog, clothing and
sunscreen use

In the absence of UVB
expo&shy;sure, the require&shy;ment for vitamin&nbsp;D must be met from diet&shy;ary sources.
Mostly, the require&shy;ment is met partially or fully by
diet, even in equa&shy;torial regions because people may embrace an urban or
sun-avoiding lifestyle.

<h3 id="18b.2.2" >18b.2.2 Vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> (ergocalciferol) </h3>

Vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> (ergo&shy;cal&shy;ciferol) cannot be made by animals.  The only source
is ingestion of certain foods in the fungi king&shy;dom.  It is import&shy;ant to
note the fungi king&shy;dom is separate from the other eukaryotic life
king&shy;doms of plants and animals and texts may erroneously refer to
vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> as a&nbsp;&ldquo;plant&rdquo; source.  Sun-exposed mush&shy;rooms naturally provide
vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub>, while UV-exposed yeast and mush&shy;rooms  added to the
food supply enhance the vitamin&nbsp;D con&shy;tent of foods 	
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Wacker M, Holick MF. (2013). vitamin&nbsp;D &mdash; effects on

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23306192/"
target="right" >Wacker and Holick, 2013</a>).</span>
<p>
The major meta&shy;bolic steps involved in the meta&shy;bolism of vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> are
similar to those for the meta&shy;bolism of vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol).  The evi&shy;dence about
efficacy of vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub> versus vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> suggests that although vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> is the more active

Hence, in the following
dis&shy;cussion and in figure 18b.2, the term &ldquo;vitamin&nbsp;&rdquo; refers to either or both vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>2</sub>
and vitamin&nbsp;D<sub>3</sub> and their meta&shy;bolites.

<h3 id="18b.2.3" >18b.2.3 Production of 25&#8209;hydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D</h3>

Vitamin&nbsp;D enters the circu&shy;lation from the skin or from the lymph via
the thoracic duct, bound to a&nbsp;specific vitamin&nbsp;D-binding pro&shy;tein.
Vitamin&nbsp;D is trans&shy;ported to adipose tissue where it is stored, or to the liver,
where it is hydrox&shy;yl&shy;ated to 25&#8209;hydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D (25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D [also called
cal&shy;cidiol when referring to 25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>], the major circulating form of vitamin&nbsp;D
(<a href="#figure18b.2">Figure&nbsp;18b.2</a>).

Figure 18b.2  Formation of vitamin D metabolites. Once the transport
form 25(OH)D is made, the Endocrine pathway (section 18b.2.4)
for synthesis of the active metabolite 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D is illustrated.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) directs synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D
in response to a need for calcium or phosphate. Plasma 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D
stimulates intestinal calcium transport and bone calcium mobilization,
then blunts PTH synthesis to turn cycle off (section 18b.13).

The plasma 25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D meta&shy;bolite has sev&shy;eral
fates.  When there is a&nbsp;need for calcium (des&shy;cribed below) then 25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D
is con&shy;verted in the kidney by an en&shy;zyme (25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D-1-&alpha;-hy&shy;droxy&shy;lase)
to pro&shy;duce the bio&shy;logi&shy;cally active meta&shy;bolite 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;D
[1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D] also called calcitriol.

Circulating 25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D can also be taken up by tissues and subsequently
con&shy;verted to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D inside cells if the 1-hy&shy;droxy&shy;lase en&shy;zyme has
been activated.  Finally,
in the pathway for inactivation and excretion of vitamin&nbsp;D in bile,  25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D 
is converted to 24,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D by the enzyme 25&#8209;hydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D-24-hydroxy&shy;lase

The enzyme 25&#8209;hydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D-24-hydroxylase also inactivates 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D (calcitriol).


<h3 id="18b.2.4" >18b.2.4  Renal production of
circulating 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;D (calcitriol)</h3>

The active form of vitamin&nbsp;D,   1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D  (calcitriol) that circulates in plasma is made in the
kidney in the Endocrine Pathway as shown in
<a href="#figure18b.2">Figure&nbsp;18b.2</a>.
This syn&shy;thesis
of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D is homeo&shy;statically con&shy;trolled,
mainly by the action of para&shy;thyroid hor&shy;mone (PTH) in res&shy;ponse to serum calcium levels, and fibro&shy;blast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) related to
serum phos&shy;phate levels 	
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Wacker M, Holick MF. (2013). Vitamin&nbsp;D &mdash; effects on

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23306192/"
target="right" >Wacker and Holick, 2013</a>),</span>
that regulate the
activ&shy;ity of renal (25(OH)D-1-&alpha;-hy&shy;droxy&shy;lase).
For exam&shy;ple, a&nbsp;de&shy;crease in plasma calcium prompts an inc&shy;rease in
para&shy;thyroid hor&shy;mone secretion from the para&shy;thyroid gland that acts to
mobilize calcium stores from the bone.  Parathyroid hor&shy;mone also
promotes the syn&shy;thesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in the kidney which, in turn,
stimulates the mobilization of calcium from the bone and inc&shy;reased
in&shy;test&shy;inal calcium absorption
(<a href="#figure18b.2">Figure&nbsp;18b.2</a>).
Once plasma calcium levels are
normal, the need for circulating 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D diminishes and there is no
stimulation of the en&shy;zyme 25(OH)D-1-&alpha;-hy&shy;droxy&shy;lase.  Thus, circulating
levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D are not related to vitamin&nbsp;D status as in
de&shy;fi&shy;ciency low levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D may reflect lack of the precursor
meta&shy;bolite 25(OH)D.  However, as vitamin&nbsp;D de&shy;fi&shy;ciency leads to sec&shy;ond&shy;ary
hyper&shy;para&shy;thyroid&shy;ism with PTH-enhanced 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D production, vitamin&nbsp;D deficiency can be
assoc&shy;iated with normal to high 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D (calcitriol) levels.
<p>
Another reason why the level of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D is not useful in assess&shy;ing vitamin&nbsp;D status
is because 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D is a&nbsp;very short-lived meta&shy;bolite causing its own
destruc&shy;tion by rapidly inducing synthesis of the 		
enzyme 25&#8209;hydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D-24-hy&shy;droxy&shy;lase

<h3 id="18b.2.5" >18b.2.5 Extrarenal production of 1,25&#8209;dihydroxy&shy;vita&shy;min&nbsp;D (calcitriol)</h3>

The extrarenal pathway of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D (calcitriol) is
locally pro&shy;duced in almost every tissue in the body
<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Norman AW.  (2008). From vitamin&nbsp;D to hor&shy;mone D:

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18689389/"

As 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D acts locally, this syn&shy;thesis pathway is called Paracrine / Autocrine.  Activity of
extra-renal 25(OH)D-1-&alpha;-hy&shy;droxy&shy;lase is not regul&shy;ated by the hor&shy;mones
that con&shy;trol renal 25(OH)D-1-&alpha;-hy&shy;droxy&shy;lase (i.e., PTH and FGF-23). The activity of the enzyme must be induced in the cell. The diverse actions
of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, when acting locally as a
trans&shy;crip&shy;tion factor in many differ&shy;ent cell types, are called
&ldquo;non-calcemic&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-skel&shy;etal&rdquo; and include immuno-modulatory and
cell-differ&shy;entiating properties. It is these properties that have led re&shy;searchers to
inves&shy;tigate vitamin&nbsp;D and its derivatives in the patho&shy;gen&shy;esis of cancer,
respiratory dis&shy;eases, and immune res&shy;ponses.  For further
details of these noncalcemic func&shy;tions see

<h3 id="18b.2.6" >18b.2.6 Serum 25(OH)D</h3>

Serum 25(OH)D is a&nbsp;biomarker of vitamin&nbsp;D exposure and status.
Both meta&shy;bolites 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D circulate in plasma. The former, 25(OH)D,
reflects the sum of vitamin&nbsp;D from diet&shy;ary intake and sunlight
expo&shy;sure, whereas plasma 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D con&shy;cen&shy;trations reflect the
immediate physio&shy;logical need and are under homeo&shy;static con&shy;trol in the kidney.
Concentrations of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in plasma are about 0.1% of those of
25(OH)D.  In vitamin&nbsp;D de&shy;fi&shy;ciency, serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels may be normal
or even ele&shy;vated, as a&nbsp;result of inc&shy;reased renal production of
1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in res&shy;ponse to the rise in serum para&shy;thyroid levels
	<span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Wacker M, Holick MF. (2013). Vitamin&nbsp;D &mdash; effects on

In con&shy;trast, plasma 25(OH)D con&shy;cent&shy;rations remain
low until a&nbsp;reserve accumulates.  As a&nbsp;result, the plasma 25(OH)D
con&shy;cent&shy;ration reflects medium to long-term vitamin&nbsp;D availability from
both diet&shy;ary and endog&shy;enous sources, thus making it the best
biomarker of vitamin&nbsp;D exposure and status.

Cases of toxicity have arisen,

and from inappropriate use of vitamin&nbsp;D metabolites.  An

and genetic disorders of rare polymorphisms of enzymes
involved in vitamin&nbsp;D metabolism (e.g., idiopathic infantile

Signs of vitamin&nbsp;D toxicity include hypercalcemia (i.e., elevated serum
calcium concentrations) and hypercalciuria (elevated urine
calcium levels).  Hypercalcemia arises from hyperabsorption
of intestinal calcium and, to a&nbsp;lesser degree, from the
release of calcium from bone and can lead to calcification
of soft tissues such as arteries (arteriosclerosis) and the
kidney (nephrocalcinosis).  The hypercalciuria associated
with vitamin&nbsp;D toxicity reflects the presence of excess
calcium in the serum arising from the release of calcium
from bone.

<h2 id="18b.5" >18b.5 Nutrient reference values for vitamin&nbsp;D</h2>

Unlike other essential nutrients, measurements of vitamin&nbsp;D
intake using traditional dietary assessment methods cannot
be used to measure dietary exposure because some of the
requirement for vitamin&nbsp;D can be met from skin synthesis, as
noted earlier.  Instead a&nbsp;surrogate
biomarker is used to measure exposure to
vitamin&nbsp;D; serum 25 hydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D (25(OH)D) is
the biomarker of choice.  Serum 25(OH)D
measures exposure to vitamin&nbsp;D from the effects of both diet
and sunlight as noted earlier, and associations between concentrations of
serum 25(OH)D and functional biomarkers of bone health have been
considered when setting Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs) for
vitamin&nbsp;D by several agencies.  The evidence for
extraskeletal outcomes has been considered inadequate,
inconsistent, or insufficient to develop Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs).
Nevertheless, in view of the variation in sunlight exposure
and the variable response to that exposure, as well as
concerns about skin cancer, several agencies, including the

<h2 id="18b.6" >18b.6 Biomarkers of vitamin&nbsp;D status</h2>

Historically, vitamin&nbsp;D status was assessed indirectly by meas&shy;uring
alkaline phos&shy;phat&shy;ase activ&shy;ity, as well as calcium and phos&shy;phorus
con&shy;cent&shy;rations in serum: all very non&shy;specific indices.
Methods are now avail&shy;able for the direct measure&shy;ment of vitamin&nbsp;D
meta&shy;bolites in serum, and these are des&shy;cribed below.  If possible, these
measure&shy;ments should be performed in con&shy;junc&shy;tion with an assay of serum
para&shy;thyroid hor&shy;mone and some func&shy;tional assess&shy;ment of skel&shy;etal health.
In adults, this assess&shy;ment may include measure&shy;ment of bone mineral
con&shy;tent or bone mineral density.  In chil&shy;dren, in extreme cases of
rickets, bony deform&shy;ities such as en&shy;larged fontanelle, rachitic rosary,
and swollen joints are clin&shy;ical signs of rickets, whereas knock knees or bowed
legs are clin&shy;ical signs of the assoc&shy;iated osteo&shy;malacia noted in growing
chil&shy;dren

Diseases causing fat mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion will reduce the absorp&shy;tion of
dietary  vitamin&nbsp;D, which could be sig&shy;nif&shy;icant in winter.  Liver dis&shy;ease will prevent the
con&shy;vers&shy;ion of vitamin&nbsp;D to 25(OH)D, whereas kidney dis&shy;ease prevents the con&shy;vers&shy;ion
of 25(OH)D to the active form (i.e. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, calcitriol) in the endo&shy;crine pathway.  Disease states

However, these are intended as guidance for clinicians
for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin&nbsp;D
deficiency, with emphasis on the care of patients who are at
high risk of deficiency (e.g., those with rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis,
chronic kidney disease, etc).

Such practice guidelines
to treat disease should not be applied to the apparently healthy
population. Clearly, more
research is urgently required using assays that
meet the standardized criteria developed by the
Vitamin&nbsp;D Standard&shy;ization Program (VDSP) (Section&nbsp;18b.9) to develop a&nbsp;consensus
on a&nbsp;single set of rigorous interpretive criteria
for serum total 25(OH)D levels relative to vitamin&nbsp;D status
and interventions that are appropriate
for both public health and clinical needs.  In the
meantime, readers are advised to use the IOM
(2011) cutoffs proposed and listed in Table&nbsp;18b.4 for public health use.
<h2 id="18b.9" >18b.9 Measurement of serum 25&#8209;hydroxy&shy;vitamin&nbsp;D</h2>

There are three main methods for meas&shy;uring
serum 25(OH)D: immuno&shy;assay, high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), and liquid chromatography with tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)  However, there are two main steps that
must be undertaken before selecting a&nbsp;method for
assaying total 25(OH)D in serum.  The first step
is verification of &ldquo;fit-for-purpose&rdquo; . This step
is only necessary when an immunoassay is the
intended method and is necessary because some
immunoassays are not appropriate for certain
patient population groups (e.g., those with
certain disease states, pregnant women, and
vegetarians such as vegans) (Sempos and Binkley,
2020).  In addition, the chosen immunoassay should
have an appropriate measurement range for the
intended study population (e.g., measure 25(OH)D
levels in persons who are deficient).  The &ldquo;fit
for purpose&rdquo; step can be accomplished by testing
the immunoassay against a&nbsp;Vitamin&nbsp;D
Standardization Program (VDSP) standardized
LC-MS/MS assay.
<p>
The second step required is standardization, a
process whereby the intended assay is calibrated
to meet the VDSP performance criteria (i.e., total
coefficient of variation (CV) &lt;&nbsp;10% and a&nbsp;mean
bias with the range of
<span class="n">&ndash;5% to +5%).</span>  Some assays,
even when based on a&nbsp;similar methodology, are less
accurate and precise, making comparison of data
across assays or laboratories difficult.  The gold
standard analytical method is LC-MS/MS and that should
always be the method of choice for national
surveys.  However, even the LC-MS/MS method must
meet the assay standardization criteria of the
VDSP.  Serum total 25(OH)D measurements can be
'prospectively' standardized or
'retrospectively' standardized, using methods
developed by VDSP; see

standardized laboratory measurement is defined as
one that provides the 'true' serum total serum

which provide target values for 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> and

Alkaline phos&shy;phat&shy;ase (EC 3.1.1.1) activ&shy;ity in serum can be used as an
indirect measure of vitamin&nbsp;D status.  Activity inc&shy;reases in
osteo&shy;malacia in adults and child&shy;hood rickets but is gener&shy;ally normal in
osteoporosis.
Increases in the activ&shy;ity of alkaline phos&shy;phat&shy;ase are usually
pro&shy;por&shy;tion&shy;al to the severity of vitamin&nbsp;D deple&shy;tion.  For exam&shy;ple,
elderly Irish indiv&shy;iduals with serum 25(OH)D levels indic&shy;ative of
severe or marg&shy;inal vitamin&nbsp;D deple&shy;tion had slightly higher serum
alkaline phos&shy;phat&shy;ase activ&shy;ity than those with 25(OH)D levels classified
as replete

Parathyroid hor&shy;mone (PTH) levels in serum or plasma are con&shy;sid&shy;ered to be a
func&shy;tional biomarker of vitamin&nbsp;D status in the normocalcemic state.  In vitamin
D de&shy;fi&shy;ciency, when calcium absorption is red&shy;uced, serum PTH levels rise to
induce calcium mobilization from the bone and inc&shy;rease tubular reabsorption
of calcium in the kidney.  In this way, serum calcium is maintained at a
physio&shy;logically optimum level.  As a&nbsp;result, serum PTH con&shy;cent&shy;rations are
inversely related to serum 25(OH)D levels

Unlike total serum
calcium alone, the exist&shy;ence of such a&nbsp;triad of bio&shy;chem&shy;ical dis&shy;turb&shy;ances
strongly indicates vitamin&nbsp;D de&shy;fi&shy;ciency.

<p>
Serum calcium is also used to identify possible vitamin&nbsp;D intoxication.  In
such cases, con&shy;cent&shy;rations of serum 25(OH)D and serum calcium are ele&shy;vated
and provide addit&shy;ional evi&shy;dence for hypervitaminosis D.
</p>
<p>
The res&shy;ponse of urin&shy;ary calcium and phos&shy;phorus levels to changes in vitamin
D status varies, as ex&shy;cretion of these minerals is also affected by diet&shy;ary
intakes.  Early osteo&shy;malacia can be detected as a&nbsp;de&shy;crease in urin&shy;ary
calcium to creat&shy;in&shy;ine ratio
