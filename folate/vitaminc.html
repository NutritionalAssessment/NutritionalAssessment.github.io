Vitamin&nbsp;C (ascorbic acid) is involved in a
variety of biological processes, acting primarily as an
electron donating enzyme cofactor and reducing agent
(antioxidant).  Clinical deficiency of vitamin&nbsp;C results in
scurvy, a relatively rare disease in high-income countries.
Nevertheless, moderate vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency (hypovitaminosis&nbsp;C) 
has been described in selected vulnerable groups such as the
institutionalized elderly, with gingival inflammation and
fatigue appearing to be the most sensitive clinical markers
for moderate vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency. Excess intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C may
produce osmotic diarrhea in some people, and although
oxaluria has been reported, this measurement is prone to errors in the
preparative or investigative procedure.  
There are currently no reliable functional
indices of vitamin&nbsp;C nutriture.  Static biochemical indices
such as plasma or leukocyte ascorbic acid concentrations are
most frequently used.  The former reflect recent dietary
intake within a limited range (30&ndash;80mg/d).  Plasma ascorbic
acid concentrations increase linearly with dietary intake
but only up to a plateau of about 70&micro;mol/L, and thus are
unsuitable for detecting excessive intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C. A
number of non-nutritional factors, including sex, body
weight, smoking, and severe infection, affect plasma
ascorbic acid concentrations, hence, plasma concentrations
are a more reliable marker of vitamin&nbsp;C status than dietary
intake assessments.  Urinary excretion of vitamin&nbsp;C occurs
when the renal reabsorption threshold had been reached and
plasma &ldquo;saturation&rdquo; occurs (between about 60 and 70&micro;mol/L).
Urinary excretion is influenced by recent dietary intake.
Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of this test is
low, and 24h urine samples are generally required.
Leukocyte ascorbic acid concentrations are considered a
relatively reliable index of tissue ascorbic acid stores in
healthy people; they are less responsive than plasma to
short-term fluctuations in vitamin&nbsp;C intakes, but their
assay is difficult and requires a larger blood sample.
Furthermore, leukocyte ascorbic acid concentrations may not
be a reliable marker of vitamin&nbsp;C status in some conditions,
such as severe infection.  The body pool size of vitamin&nbsp;C
has been estimated using isotope dilution techniques.  More
research is needed to identify useful functional tests of
vitamin&nbsp;C status.

<h2 id="19.1">19.1 Vitamin&nbsp;C</h2>
    
For centuries, the consumption of citrus
fruit has been associated with the prevention of the vitamin
C deficiency disease scurvy, but it was not until 1932 that
the active compound was isolated (King and Waugh, 1932;
Svirbely and Szent-Györgyi, 1932).  A year later, ascorbic
acid was characterized and became the first vitamin to be
chemically synthesized.  Humans are unable to synthesize
vitamin&nbsp;C in vivo from glucose due to random genetic
mutations, which occurred at an early stage in our
evolution, that have resulted in loss of the terminal enzyme
in the biosynthetic pathway, L-gulonolactone oxidase
(Nishikimi and Yagi, 1991; Drouin et al, 2011).  The term
&ldquo;vitamin&nbsp;C&rdquo; is used to embrace both L-ascorbic acid and its
oxidised form, L-dehydroascorbic acid; both have
approximately equal vitamin&nbsp;C activity as dehydroascorbic
acid can be readily reduced back to the biologically active
ascorbic acid in the body.  Ascorbic acid is the enolic form
of an ?-ketolactone
(2,3-didehydro-L-threo-hexano-1,4-lactone), which in
solution can be oxidized to the diketo form—
dehydro-L-ascorbic acid; their structures are shown in
Figure 19.1.  Under physiological conditions, vitamin&nbsp;C is
present predominantly as the mono-anion, ascorbate.

Figure 19.1.  Structure of L-ascorbic acid and
dehydroascorbic acid. 19.2 Functions of vitamin&nbsp;C Ascorbic
acid acts as an electron donating cofactor for a family of
biosynthetic and regulatory metalloenzymes that carry out
important hydroxylation reactions (Englard and Seifter,
1986; Kuiper and Vissers, 2014; Young et al., 2015).  These
include copper-containing mono-oxygenases and iron-
containing dioxygenases.  Of the latter, the most well-known
is hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues during
synthesis of collagen, the major connective tissue protein
in the body.  Ascorbic acid acts in these hydroxylation
reactions by reducing the metal catalytic sites of
procollagen proline 4-dioxygenase (EC 1.14.11.2) and
procollagen lysine 5-dioxygenase (EC 1.14.11.4).  Decreased
activity of these two enzymes can lead to the defects in
connective tissue that in turn cause the characteristic
clinical features of scurvy.  These include joint pain,
tooth loss, bone and connective tissue disorders, and poor
wound healing.  Ascorbic acid is also involved in the
hydroxylation of dopamine to noradrenaline, by acting as a
cofactor for the enzyme dopamine-?-monooxygenase (EC
1.14.17.1).  Noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter, and
deficient dopamine hydroxylation may be associated with the
mood changes, depression, and hypochondria that can occur
with scurvy.  The early symptoms of scurvy - fatigue,
lethargy, and muscle weakness - are related to the role of
ascorbic acid as a cofactor for maximal activity of two
dioxygenases involved in carnitine biosynthesis
(N?-trimethyllysine dioxygenase; EC 1.14.11.8, and
?-butyrobetaine dioxygenase; EC 1.14.11.1).  Carnitine is
essential for the transport of activated long-chain fatty
acids into the mitochondria, where they are converted to
energy by way of ?-oxidation (Englard and Seifter, 1986).
Several other enzymes depend on ascorbic acid as a cofactor,
although their specific role in the development of scurvy is
still unclear.  These include peptidylglycine ?-amidating
monooxygenase (EC 1.14.17.3), an enzyme required for the
synthesis of numerous amidated peptide hormones which have
multiple functions throughout the body (Englard and Seifter,
1986).  More recent discoveries have included the
hydroxylases that regulate the concentration and activity of
the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1?  (i.e.
hypoxia-inducible factor-proline dioxygenase; EC 1.14.11.29,
and hypoxia-inducible factor-asparagine dioxygenase; EC
1.14.11.30) (Kuiper and Vissers, 2014), and the ten-eleven
translocation (TET) hydroxylases and histone demethylases
that modify epigenetic marks on DNA and histones (Young et
al., 2015).  Together, these epigenetic and transcription
regulating enzymes have the potential to up- and down-regulate 
thousands of genes in the body, likely contributing
to vitamin&nbsp;C’s pleiotropic functions in human health and
disease.  Ascorbic acid also has several nonenzymatic
functions based on its role as a reducing agent and
antioxidant (i.e. electron donation).  For example, ascorbic
acid enhances the gastrointestinal absorption of nonheme
iron, through its ability to reduce intraluminal iron to its
more absorbable ferrous form (Hallberg et al., 1987).
Ascorbic acid is a potent antioxidant, with the ability to
quench a wide range of reactive oxygen species, including
neutralising phagocyte-derived oxidants, thus attenuating
tissue damage (Carr and Frei, 1999a).  Ascorbic acid
provides important antioxidant protection to plasma lipids
and lipid membranes through direct scavenging of reactive
oxygen species and through the regeneration of vitamin E
from its oxidised form (?- tocopheroxyl radical).  Ascorbic
acid can also regenerate the enzyme cofactor
tetrahydrobiopterin from its oxidised form
(dihydrobiopterin), thus potentially aiding synthesis of
dopamine, serotonin and nitric oxide.  At high intakes,
vitamin&nbsp;C has been associated with protection against
cardiovascular disease, cataracts, and cancer (Carr and
Frei, 1999b), and a variety of immune-related functions
(Carr and Maggini, 2017).  Additional research, however, is
needed to establish causal relationships between vitamin&nbsp;C
and these degenerative diseases and immunocompetence. 19.3
Absorption and metabolism of vitamin&nbsp;C Vitamin&nbsp;C is absorbed
in the small intestine by an active sodium-dependent vitamin
C transporter (SVCT-1) that can become saturated and is dose
dependent (Savini et al., 2008).  About 70%&ndash;90% of vitamin&nbsp;C
is absorbed when daily intakes range from 30 to 180 mg, but
absorption falls to ? 50% at intakes above 1 g/d (Kallner et
al., 1979; Levine et al., 1996).  Indeed, the osmotic
diarrhea and intestinal discomfort sometimes experienced by
persons ingesting large gram doses of vitamin&nbsp;C is due to
the presence of a large amount of unabsorbed vitamin&nbsp;C.
Regulation of the whole body vitamin&nbsp;C content is achieved
in part by this dose-dependent intestinal absorption of
vitamin&nbsp;C. Renal action to conserve vitamin&nbsp;C (via SVCT-1)
or excrete unmetabolized vitamin&nbsp;C also plays an important
part.  Tissue uptake occurs primarily by the SVCT-2 isoform
(Savini et al., 2008).  Different tissues uptake and retain
vitamin&nbsp;C to variable extents, with neuronal and glandular
tissues containing the highest concentrations (Hornig,
1975), indicating vital roles for vitamin&nbsp;C in these
tissues.  Catabolism of ascorbic acid in humans occurs
through oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid and, in the
absence of sufficient reducing equivalents, subsequent
hydrolysis to diketogulonic acid.  This can then be oxidised
to smaller molecules, such as oxalate, that are excreted in
urine.  However, it should be noted that dehydroascorbic
acid is readily taken up via cell membrane glucose
transporters (GLUTs) and rapidly reduced back to ascorbic
acid via various chemical and enzymatic pathways (Rumsey et
al., 1997; Washko et al, 1993), thus limiting
dehydroascorbic acid concentrations in vivo.  With large
intakes, most of the vitamin&nbsp;C is excreted in its
unmetabolized form (Levine et al., 1996). 19.4 Deficiency of
vitamin&nbsp;C in humans Clinical manifestations of scurvy, such
as weakness, petechial hemorrhages, gingival bleeding,
ecchymoses and subperiosteal hemorrhage, anemia, and defects
in bone development in children, are relatively rare in
high-income countries.  Nevertheless, vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency
has been observed in institutionalized elderly subjects,
likely arising from inadequate intake of vitamin&nbsp;C (Carr and
Rowe, 2020).  Alcoholic patients, those on restrictive diets
and people in refugee camps are also vulnerable to vitamin&nbsp;C
deficiency.  Infantile scurvy is rare because breast milk
provides adequate amounts of ascorbic acid and infant
formulas are fortified with sufficient ascorbic acid to
prevent the disease.  Subclinical vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency may
develop secondarily to some disease states such as severe
respiratory infections, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders,
cardiometabolic disorders and inflammatory diseases.  This
is likely partly due to the enhanced oxidative stress and
inflammation associated with many of these diseases, as well
as the use of certain drugs (e.g. aspirin) or
chemotherapeutic agents that appear to affect the
bioavailability or metabolism of ascorbic acid (Basu, 1982;
Carr and Cook, 2018).  The functional health consequences of
both mild and moderate vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency are not well
characterized.  Gingival inflammation, fatigue, and
irritability have been reported in moderate vitamin&nbsp;C
deficiency induced experimentally (Leggott et al.,1986;
Levine et al., 1996). 19.5 Food sources and dietary intakes
of vitamin&nbsp;C Vitamin&nbsp;C is synthesised in plants, however,
the vitamin&nbsp;C content of different foods is highly variable
(Carr and Rowe, 2020).  Values can also depend on the
growing conditions, season of the year, stage of maturity,
location, and storage time prior to consumption.  Exposure
to high temperatures, oxidation, or cooking in large amounts
of water all reduce the vitamin&nbsp;C content of foods.  Major
food sources of vitamin&nbsp;C in the diets of most high-income
countries are fresh fruits and fruit juices and some fresh
vegetables; they can contribute up to 90% of the vitamin&nbsp;C
intake.  Citrus and kiwifruit are particularly rich sources
of vitamin&nbsp;C. Of the vegetables, potatoes can be one of the
most important sources of vitamin&nbsp;C in the diets of adults,
for example in the U.K.  (Gregory et al.,1990).  Most staple
foods, e.g. rice, wheat, maize and other grains, contain
negligible vitamin&nbsp;C and meat, fish, eggs, and dairy
products are also poor sources (Carr and Rowe, 2020).  In
low-income countries, the supply of food sources of vitamin
C is often seasonal, so intakes may vary widely.  In The
Gambia, for example, intakes ranged from zero to 115mg/d in
one community, depending on the seasonal availability of
mangos, oranges, and grapefruit (Bates et al., 1994).  The
bioavailability of vitamin&nbsp;C from food sources is comparable
to that of supplements in humans and is not affected by the
type of food consumed (Carr and Vissers, 2013). 19.6
Nutrient Reference values for vitamin&nbsp;C 19.6.1 Recommended
intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C Vitamin&nbsp;C intake recommendations vary
greatly around the world, from as low as 40mg/d in the U.K.
to 110mg/d in several European countries, which has
resulted in calls for harmonization (Carr and Lykkesfeldt,
2020).  Recommended intakes for women are often lower than
men due to their lower body weight, a criterion also applied
to intakes for children.  Higher vitamin&nbsp;C intakes are
recommended for pregnant (+10-20mg/d) and lactating (+20-60
mg/d) women due to the needs of the developing foetus and
growing infant.  Furthermore, some countries recommend
higher intakes for smokers (+20-80mg/d) due to their
enhanced oxidative burden.  Finally, several countries have
proposed intakes or suggested dietary targets of ~200mg/d
for chronic disease risk reduction.  This intake provides
saturating plasma ascorbic acid concentrations in healthy
people (Levine et al, 1996). 19.6.2 Effects of high intakes
of vitamin&nbsp;C Because vitamin&nbsp;C is water soluble, any excess
not required by the body is readily excreted, therefore,
there is no known upper toxic concentration.  However, some
countries have set 1-2 g/d as upper tolerable concentrations
based on potential gastrointestinal disturbances at very
large (>4 g/d) doses in some people (IOM, 2000).  In
addition to diarrhea and other gastrointestinal
disturbances, possible adverse effects of excessive intakes
include an increase in the absorption of dietary iron
potentially leading to iron overload in people with
hemochromatosis, and haemolytic anaemia in people with
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency due to an
inability to attenuate hydrogen peroxide generation.
Current evidence is insufficient to implicate high intakes
of vitamin&nbsp;C as a risk factor in oxalate stone formation.
Nevertheless, individuals with hemochromatosis,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and renal
disorders, may be susceptible to adverse effects from
excessive intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C (IOM, 2000). 19.7 Indices of
vitamin&nbsp;C status There are no reliable functional tests of
vitamin&nbsp;C status.  Instead, static biochemical tests,
particularly the measurement of plasma or leukocyte ascorbic
acid concentrations, are most frequently used to assess
vitamin&nbsp;C status.  These static biochemical tests are
discussed in detail below. 19.8 Plasma ascorbic acid
Ascorbic acid is transported in the plasma but is not bound
to any protein; almost all is present as the ascorbate
monoanion.  Plasma (or serum) ascorbic acid concentrations
are the most frequently used and practical index of vitamin
C status in studies of individuals and populations.
Concentrations are influenced by recent intake of the
vitamin, making fasting blood samples essential. 19.8.1
Ascorbic acid pharmacokinetics Plasma ascorbic acid
concentrations exhibit a characteristic sigmoidal
relationship with intake, as shown in Figure 19.2.  In
adults, the steepest change is evident at intakes between
about 30 and 90mg/d of vitamin&nbsp;C. When intakes are below
?20mg/d, most of the vitamin&nbsp;C enters the tissues, so there
is very little available for circulation in the blood.  For
intakes greater than 100mg/d, plasma concentrations tend to
plateau between 60 and 70&micro;mol/L, concentrations
representing the renal threshold and plasma saturation
(Figure 19.2).  When intakes exceed ~200mg/d, intestinal
absorption of vitamin&nbsp;C becomes the limiting factor (Levine
et al., 1996).  Figure 19.2.  The relationship of plasma
ascorbate relative to daily vitamin&nbsp;C intake.  From Bates et
al.  (1997), with permission of Oxford University Press.  As
a result of this threshold effect with only limited
intestinal absorption at intakes >200mg/d, and the excess
circulating ascorbic acid being excreted in the urine,
plasma ascorbic acid concentrations cannot identify people
who are regularly consuming excessive amounts of vitamin&nbsp;C.
Hence, it is not surprising that in the U.S.  National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II, a
correlation between plasma ascorbic acid and vitamin&nbsp;C
intakes was only reported for people not taking vitamin&nbsp;C
supplements (Loria et al., 1998).  Vitamin&nbsp;C is one of the
best markers for fruit and vegetable intake, particularly
fruit intake (Block et al. 2001; Drewnowski et al, 1997),
however, strong correlations between dietary intakes of
vitamin&nbsp;C and plasma ascorbic acid concentrations have only
been reported when habitual dietary intakes of ascorbic acid
are relatively modest (30&ndash;80mg/d) (Bates et al., 1979).
People consuming chronically low intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C likely
have plasma ascorbic acid concentrations that reflect the
ascorbic acid content of the body (Jacob et al., 1987).
Indeed, in such circumstances, plasma concentrations are
probably as accurate an indicator as concentrations in
leukocytes.  However, the relationship may be obscured in
epidemiological studies by other factors that affect the
absorption or metabolic turnover of vitamin&nbsp;C. In NHANES
III, for example, only 50% of adult men had serum ascorbic
acid concentrations >38&micro;mol/L, although more than 75% had
dietary intakes higher than the estimated average
requirement (i.e., 75mg/d) (IOM, 2000).  Such a discrepancy
may be due, in part, to the high proportion of U.S. adult
males who smoke or who are exposed to environmental tobacco
smoke. 19.8.2 Factors affecting plasma ascorbic acid
Cigarette smoking has a marked effect on plasma ascorbic
acid concentrations.  Many studies report lower plasma
ascorbic acid concentrations in smokers (Carr and Rowe,
2020), as well as in those regularly exposed to
environmental cigarette smoke (Figure 19.3; Tribble et al.,
1993).  The mechanism controlling the influence of cigarette
smoking on plasma ascorbic acid concentrations appears to be
related to the higher metabolic turnover of vitamin&nbsp;C in
smokers than in nonsmokers (Kallner et al., 1981), which is
probably induced by increased oxidative stress from
substances in smoke.  Certainly, studies using isotopically
labeled ascorbic acid show an increased metabolic turnover
of ascorbic acid in smokers (70mg/d versus 36mg/d for
nonsmokers), resulting in a 40% greater requirement for
vitamin&nbsp;C (IOM, 2000).  Smokers also tend to have lower
dietary intake of vitamin&nbsp;C, further contributing to a poor
vitamin&nbsp;C status (Schectman et al, 1989).  Figure 19.3.  The
effects of cigarette-smoke exposure on plasma ascorbic acid
concentrations in 141 premenopausal women who were active or
passive smokers, or nonexposed nonsmokers.  Three
concentrations of dietary vitamin&nbsp;C intake are represented
in the results.  Data from Tribble et al., American Journal
of Clinical Nutrition 58:  886&ndash;890, 1993 © Am J Clin Nutr.
American Society for Clinical Nutrition.  Sex influences
plasma ascorbic acid concentrations; women have higher
plasma ascorbic acid concentrations than men who consume
similar intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C. However, this is likely partly
explained by volumetric dilution due to differences in
fat-free mass (Jungert and Neuhauser-Berthold, 2015), a
premise supported by a lack of sex differences in plasma
ascorbic acid concentrations before adolescence.  For
example, in NHANES III, higher serum ascorbate
concentrations in women than in men were only apparent in
those aged >19 y; no sex-related differences were reported
in younger age groups (IOM, 2000).  Thus, sex differences in
lean body mass are likely a contributing factor (Blanchard,
1991).  Age-related differences in plasma ascorbic acid
concentrations have been reported.  The elderly, especially
those who are institutionalized or housebound, may have
lower concentrations than those of younger persons (Carr and
Rowe, 2020).  This trend has been attributed in part to
lower dietary intakes because of problems of poor dentition
or chronic diseases that may influence absorption or renal
functioning.  Nevertheless, at present, there is no evidence
that the elderly have higher vitamin&nbsp;C requirements than
those for young adults.  Indeed, NHANES IV data has
indicated a U-shaped curve for circulating vitamin&nbsp;C
concentrations by age (Schleicher et al, 2009).  Pregnancy
lowers plasma ascorbic acid concentrations due to increasing
body weight and hemodilution, as well as active transfer to
the fetus, especially during the last trimester.  Lactation
results in even higher requirements due to active transfer
of an average of 40mg/d vitamin&nbsp;C through milk to the
growing infant (IOM, 2000).  Higher body weight is typically
associated with lower vitamin&nbsp;C status in epidemiological
studies.  This is likely due to volumetric dilution, whereby
an identical vitamin&nbsp;C intake will result in lower vitamin&nbsp;C
status in a person of higher body weight relative to a
person of lower body weight (Block, 1999).  People with
central obesity are likely to have even higher requirements
due to enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation (Carr et
al., 2022).  Despite the obesity pandemic in many regions of
the world, and the use of body weight to estimate vitamin&nbsp;C
recommendations for women and children, there are as yet no
vitamin&nbsp;C recommendation categories for large or overweight
individuals.  Acute or chronic infection lowers circulating
ascorbic acid concentrations.  The more severe the
infection, the lower the vitamin&nbsp;C status, as evidenced by
the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis C and deficiency in
hospitalised patients with pneumonia and sepsis (Carr,
2020). 19.8.3 Interpretive criteria for plasma Protracted
intakes of vitamin&nbsp;C <20mg/d cause plasma ascorbic acid
concentrations to decline rapidly to deficient
concentrations (i.e. 11&micro;mol/L or less) (Hodges et al.,
1971; Jacob et al., 1987).  At the lower plasma ascorbic
acid concentrations, clinical signs of scurvy such as
follicular hyperkeratosis, swollen or bleeding gums,
petechial hemorrhages, and joint pain occur (Hodges et al.,
1969).  Therefore, plasma ascorbic acid concentrations ?11
&micro;mol/L are taken as indicative of vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency.  The
cut-off values for plasma ascorbic acid concentrations used
to define different categories are poorly defined.  NHANES
II defined &ldquo;clinically based categories&rdquo; of plasma ascorbate
concentrations in terms ofmg/dL, i.e. deficient <0.2, low
0.2-0.39, normal 0.4-0.99, and saturated ?1.0mg/dL (which
equate to <11, 11-22, 23-56, and ?57&micro;mol/L, respectively)
(Loria et al., 1998).  Of note, the low (hypovitaminosis C)
cut-off is when the &ldquo;sub-clinical&rdquo; signs and symptoms of
vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency start to be observed, e.g. changes in
mood and energy levels.  More recently, the European Food
Safety Authority (EFSA) has defined ?50&micro;mol/L as &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;
(Table 19.1; EFSA, 2013).  Furthermore, well-conducted
pharmacokinetic studies in men and women suggest that 70
µmol/L is a more accurate cut-off for &ldquo;saturation&rdquo;, although
there is variation between individuals (Levine et al., 1996;
Levine et al., 2001).  These criteria have been used in more
recent NHANES analyses (Crook et al, 2021; Narayanan et al.
2021), which indicated that smoking, male sex and higher
body weight/BMI were common indicators for lower vitamin&nbsp;C
status.  Status Plas ma AA (µm ol/L) Deficient ? 11

for plasma ascorbic acid concentrations.  Of note, the mean
vitamin&nbsp;C status of many high-income populations globally is
typically around 50&micro;mol/L, with sex differences noted (Rowe
and Carr, 2020).  The prevalence of hypovitaminosis C and
outright deficiency also tends to be relatively low in these
countries.  In contrast, many low-middle income populations
typically have lower mean vitamin&nbsp;C status, and a higher
prevalence of hypovitaminosis C and deficiency, largely
explained by lower dietary intakes.  Vitamin&nbsp;C status and
intake data from national surveys (e.g.  U.S.  NHANES and
U.K.  National Diet and Nutrition Survey) can be found in
this review and the cited references (Rowe and Carr, 2020).
19.8.4 Measurement of plasma ascorbic acid Fasting blood
samples are required for plasma ascorbic acid analysis.  The
samples need to be preserved when collected to avoid
degradation of the ascorbic acid.  Metaphosphoric acid (or
trichloroacetic acid) is typically used to precipitate
protein and to stabilize the ascorbic acid in samples prior
to analysis.  Additionally, a reducing agent, such as
dithiothreitol (DTT), can be added to preserve the ascorbic
acid in a reduced state.  The reducing agent TCEP
(tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) is versatile in that it can
also work in acidified solutions with longer incubation
times.  A metal chelator, such as DTPA
(diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), can be added to
attenuate metal ion-dependent oxidation of ascorbic acid
(particularly important if samples are haemolysed).  It
should be noted that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid),
although a commonly used metal-chelator, is still redox
active and can catalyse oxidation of ascorbic acid if
samples are not handled appropriately (Puller et al. 2018)
Plasma samples for ascorbic acid analysis that have been
prepared appropriately and frozen at &minus;20°C are stable for
several weeks and at &minus;70°C for at least 1 y (Margolis and
Duewer, 1996).  If the samples cannot be processed
immediately, whole blood can be stored for up to 8 h at 4°C
before processing (Galan et al., 1988).  Care needs to be
taken with choice of anti-coagulants for collection of blood
samples as the anti-coagulant EDTA, although a
metal-chelator, remains redox active and can result in loss
of ascorbic acid if the blood or plasma samples are not kept
at 4°C (Puller et al. 2018).  Several methods are available
for measuring vitamin&nbsp;C in both the reduced form or as total
ascorbic acid.  The older colourimetric or fluorometric
assays use predominantly 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine or
o-phenylenediamine.  These methods, however, have a number
of limitations (Washko et al., 1992).  Their sensitivity and
specificity is low, and they are often subject to
interference by other biological substances and yield
falsely high readings at low ascorbic acid concentrations.
In some circumstances, inadvertent oxidation of ascorbic
acid or hydrolysis of dehydroascorbic acid may occur.  The
method of choice for measuring ascorbic acid in plasma
samples is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC);
only 50 ?L of plasma is required for the measurement.  Of
the HPLC methods available, electrochemical detection is
preferred, with its high selectivity and sensitivity.
However, this method does require a dedicated instrument and
an experienced operator (Washko et al., 1989).  Other
simpler methods use HPLC coupled with an ultraviolet (UV)
detector, but these can have a lower sensitivity and
specificity (Washko et al., 1992).  Analysis of
dehydroascorbic acid by HPLC is more difficult, because
direct electrochemical or UV detection of dehydroascorbic
acid is not possible.  Instead, samples must first be
analysed for ascorbic acid and then reduced for measurement
of ascorbate plus dehydroascorbic acid.  Dehydroascorbic
acid is then determined by subtraction.  In vivo
concentrations of dehydroascorbic acid are generally very
low (e.g.  <2&micro;mol/L) due to rapid uptake (via GLUTs) and
intracellular reduction to ascorbic acid by cells of the
vasculature.  Therefore, reports of higher concentrations of
dehydroascorbic acid in different disease states are likely
due to artefactual ex vivo oxidation often associated with
use of the older spectrophotometric methods and/or
inappropriate handling and processing of the samples prior
to analysis (Puller et al. 2018). 19.9 Ascorbic acid in
leukocytes and specific cell subsets Leukocytes include
lymphocytes, monocytes, and three classes of granulocytes:
polymorphonuclear leukocytes or neutrophils, eosinophils,
and basophils.  These cell types differ in their
concentration of ascorbic acid and possibly in their
response to supplemental vitamin&nbsp;C (Levine et al., 1996;
Levine et al., 2001), thus complicating the interpretation
of ascorbic acid concentrations in leukocytes. 19.9.1
Leukocyte ascorbic acid Concentrations of ascorbic acid in
plasma correlate relatively well with leukocytes (Figure
19.4; Sauberlich et al., 1989), although ascorbic acid
concentrations in leukocytes are at least 14 times greater
than those in plasma (Levine et al., 1996; Levine et al.,
2001).  The ascorbic acid concentrations of mixed leukocytes
range from 90 to 300 nmol/108 cells in adults (Omaye et al.,
1979), and depend in part on the heterogeneous nature of the
leukocytes, and the methods used to isolate and analyse
them.

ascorbic acid concentrations measured at various stages

Leukocyte ascorbic acid concentrations are commonly believed
to be a more reliable index of tissue stores of ascorbic
acid than are the corresponding concentrations in the
plasma, erythrocytes, or whole blood (Turnbull et al.,
1981).  Leukocyte ascorbic acid concentrations are less
responsive than plasma to short-term fluctuations in recent
vitamin&nbsp;C intakes.  In the study shown in Figure 19.5,
leukocyte ascorbic acid concentrations decreased about 33%,
compared with the much larger and more rapid decline in
plasma.  Similar trends have been reported by others (Jacob
et al., 1987).  Thus, they provide a less sensitive measure
of lower intakes.  Concentrations of ascorbic acid in
leukocytes reflect changes in tissue ascorbic acid
concentrations and the ascorbic acid body pool, but not
dietary intakes.  Animal studies (i.e., monkeys and guinea
pigs) have confirmed that leukocyte ascorbic acid
concentrations provide an accurate reflection of ascorbic
acid concentrations in the liver and body pool (Omaye et
al., 1987).  Figure 19.5.  Mean plasma and leukocyte
ascorbic acid concentrations during a depletion and
repletion study of a group of six adult females.  Ascorbic
acid intakes were ad libitum for days 1&ndash;6; 0mg/d for days
6&ndash;30; 30mg/d for days 31&ndash;40; 60mg/d for days 41&ndash;50; and 90
mg/d for days 51&ndash;60.  Data from Sauberlich et al., American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition 50:  1039–1049, 1989 © Am J
Clin Nutr.  American Society for Clinical Nutrition.
Several factors can influence the concentrations of ascorbic
acid in leukocytes.  It has been proposed that the
platelet/leukocyte ratio can influence leukocyte ascorbic
acid values (Vallance, 1986).  Platelets have comparable
ascorbic acid concentrations to mononuclear cells (Levine et
al., 2001), and should ideally be separated from leukocytes
prior to leukocyte ascorbic acid assays (Vallance, 1986).
Choice of the anticoagulant used may influence binding of
platelets to leukocytes (Healy and Egan 1984).  Some
additional non-dietary factors that influence concentrations
of ascorbic acid in leukocytes are smoking, sex, infection,
and certain drugs, as discussed for plasma ascorbic acid
concentrations.  In some cases, these effects are due to
alterations in cell populations (e.g., acute infection) or
to differences in ascorbic acid uptake (Lee et al., 1988).
Finally, concentrations of vitamin&nbsp;C in phagocytic cells,
such as neutrophils, can be influenced by activation of
their oxidative burst.  This results in the generation of
reactive oxygen species which oxidise extracellular ascorbic
acid to dehydroascorbic acid that is readily transported
into the cells via membrane GLUTs, where it is then rapidly
reduced back to ascorbic acid (Wasko et al, 1993).  Higher
than anticipated concentrations of vitamin&nbsp;C have been
observed in leukocytes isolated from patients with severe
sepsis, which is a condition characterised by systemic
oxidative stress and activation of neutrophils (Carr et al.,
2021). 19.9.2 Ascorbic acid in specific cell subsets The
specific cell type that is most useful for assessing vitamin
C status is presently uncertain.  As noted earlier, both
ascorbic acid concentrations in individual leukocytes and
their response to vitamin&nbsp;C supplementation vary.
Mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and monocytes) have
concentrations that are two- to threefold higher than
granulocytes (e.g., neutrophils).  Furthermore, the ascorbic
acid pool in mononuclear cells is depleted more slowly than
that from other blood compartments (Jacob, 1990).  In
addition, it can be difficult to obtain homogeneous and
reproducible fractions of specific cell types, so that their
reported ascorbic acid concentrations can vary widely.
Lymphocyte ascorbic acid concentrations of 120&ndash;250 nmol/108
cells have been reported for healthy adults not consuming
supplemental vitamin&nbsp;C (Evans et al., 1982; Yew, 1984).
Jacob et al.  (1991) measured lymphocyte ascorbic acid
concentrations in a depletion&ndash;repletion study of healthy men
that was designed to induce moderate vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency.
The mean baseline lymphocyte ascorbic acid concentration in
the men was 209 nmol/108 cells.  After 60 d of depletion,
lymphocyte ascorbic acid concentrations fell significantly
and consistently to a mean concentration of 87 nmol/108
cells.  Moreover, the concentrations distinguished between
the group of participants receiving 5, 10, or 20 mg ascorbic
acid (74&ndash;145 nmol/108 cells) versus those participants
receiving 60 or 250mg/d (182&ndash;261 nmol/108 cells).  Strong
correlations of plasma and lymphocyte ascorbic acid
concentrations were noted within the individual subjects
when ascorbic acid intakes ranged from 5 to 250mg/d (Table
19.2).  There was no evidence of scorbutic symptoms in the
depletion phase of this study, but there was evidence of
greater oxidative damage, based on alterations in indices of
oxidant status (Jacob et al., 1991).  Table 19.2.  Ascorbic
acid concentrations of healthy men after periods of various
ascorbic acid intakes.  Ascorbic acid concentrations are

American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 54:  1302S–1309S,
1991 © Am J Clin Nutr.  American Society for Clinical
Nutrition.  In later ascorbic acid depletion–repletion
studies in men and women, Levine et al.  (1996, 2001)
measured concentrations of ascorbic acid in purified
neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes.  Neutrophil ascorbic
acid concentrations increased markedly in response to
supplemental vitamin&nbsp;C intakes of between 30 and 100mg/d
but showed little further increase at higher doses.  This
trend is similar to that observed for plasma ascorbic acid
concentrations (Figure 19.2), although the latter reach a
plateau at higher daily doses (~200mg/d).  The
concentrations of ascorbic acid in purified monocytes and
lymphocytes also followed a similar trend, again reaching a
plateau at doses of 100mg/d. 19.9.3 Interpretive criteria
for leukocytes Confusion exists over the interpretive
criteria used for leukocyte ascorbic acid concentrations, in
part because they can be expressed in different ways:  per
108 cells, per mL, per DNA concentration, or per unit of
protein.  This makes comparisons among laboratories
difficult.  The most common method is in terms of cell
numbers (nmol/108 cells).  The heterogeneous nature of the
leukocytes and various technical difficulties with their
analyses, are further complicating factors.  Table 19.3
presents the interpretive criteria used by Jacob (1994) and
given in Sauberlich (1999), expressed in terms of cell
numbers.  When expressed in this way, clinical signs of
scurvy, such as swollen or bleeding gums, petechial
hemorrhages, and so on, have been associated with leukocyte
concentrations of about 11 nmol/108 cells.  Even at
concentrations as high as 50 nmol/108 cells, scorbutic
changes including inflammation, tenderness, bleeding of the
gums, and petechiae have sometimes been described
(Sauberlich et al., 1989).  For this reason, the cut-off
shown in Table 19.3 that is indicative of deficiency is <57
nmol/108 cells.  S t a t u s M i x e d l e u k o c y t e s (

> 1 1 4 > 1 4 2 Table 19.3.  Interpretive criteria for
leukocyte ascorbic acid concentrations.  From Jacob (1994).
Cut-off values for ascorbic acid concentrations in specific
cell types such as neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes
are less certain.  Levine et al.  (1996, 2001) showed that
intracellular ascorbic acid concentrations in neutrophils
were less than half of corresponding mononuclear leukocyte
(lymphocyte and monocyte) concentrations.  The
interpretation of leukocyte ascorbic acid concentrations may
be particularly difficult in surgical patients or in cases
of severe infection; these conditions are often associated
with leukocytosis, activation of neutrophils, and systemic
oxidative stress (Schorah et al., 1986; Vallance, 1988; Carr
et al., 2021). 19.9.4 Measurement of leukocyte ascorbic acid
The isolation and assay of leukocytes for ascorbic acid is
technically difficult, and presently requires relatively
large blood samples (2–5 mL), making the assay unsuitable
for serial measurements on infants.  Leukocytes can be
isolated with density-gradient sedimentation (Boyum, 1968).
Monoclonal antibodies to various cell types can also be used
(Field, 1996).  Analysis of ascorbic acid in leukocytes or
specific cell types is best performed by HPLC with
electrochemical detection, after deproteinization (Washko et
al., 1989). 19.10 Ascorbic acid in erythrocytes and whole
blood Erythrocyte ascorbic acid concentrations are not
widely used as an index of ascorbic acid status.
Concentrations are roughly comparable to plasma but only
respond to changes in vitamin&nbsp;C intake over a narrow range.
Hence, they are not as sensitive as plasma ascorbic acid
concentrations (Hodges et al., 1971).  Because erythrocyte
concentrations are less responsive to recent dietary intake,
they could potentially be used to assess ascorbic acid
status in non-fasting individuals (Puller et al., 2020).
However, both within- and between-variation and analytical
variance can be greater than for plasma ascorbic acid (Jacob
et al., 1987).  Erythrocyte ascorbic acid is technically
more challenging to measure due to potential for oxidation
of ascorbic acid by haemoglobin-associated iron; the
haemoglobin is ideally removed via centrifugal filter units
(Li et al., 2012).  It should also be noted that conditions
of vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency result in enhanced erythrocyte
fragility and haemolysis (Tu et al., 2015, 2017).  Whole
blood ascorbic acid concentrations have also been
investigated in ascorbic acid depletion–repletion studies.
Again, concentrations in whole blood are not as sensitive as
plasma for assessing ascorbic acid depletion (Jacob et al.,
1987).  Concentrations <17&micro;mol/L are considered deficient
because they have been associated with scorbutic signs
(Sauberlich et al., 1989); those of 17–28&micro;mol/L are
considered low.  Concentrations >28&micro;mol/L are interpreted
as acceptable (Sauberlich, 1999).  Whole blood ascorbic acid
concentrations are rarely used these days. 19.11 Urinary
excretion of ascorbic acid and metabolites Urine is the
major excretory route for absorbed ascorbic acid.  Most
ascorbic acid is excreted in its unmetabolized form (Levine
et al., 1996).  When intakes are >1 g/d, there is some
increase in oxalate excretion (Olson and Hodges, 1987).
However, reports of high oxalate excretion are likely due to
artefactual ex vivo oxidation of excreted ascorbic acid
prior to analysis (Chalmers et al., 1985), therefore careful
handling of urine samples is required.  Urinary excretion of
ascorbic acid reflects recent dietary intake.  Experimental
depletion–repletion studies have demonstrated that
concentrations in the urine decline progressively with
increasing depletion of vitamin&nbsp;C until, in persons with
scurvy, concentrations are undetectable (Jacob et al.,
1987).  Nevertheless, urinary excretion is not a very
sensitive index of ascorbic acid status; differences between
persons with adequate or deficient intakes of ascorbic acid
are small.  For example, in the depletion–repletion study of
11 young men shown in Figure 19.6, although urinary ascorbic
acid excretion was significantly lower during the depletion
periods (weeks 3–6) than in the initial 2-wk 65mg/d
baseline period, the differences were small.  Figure 19.6.
Mean urinary ascorbic acid during times of varied ascorbic
acid intake.  Data from a study of 11 adult men by Jacob et
al., American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 46, 818–826,
1987 © Am J Clin Nutr.  American Society for Clinical
Nutrition.  More recent pharmacokinetic investigation has
indicated a renal threshold of ~60&micro;mol/L plasma ascorbic
acid for a majority of healthy individuals (Ebenuwa et al.,
2022), a concentration attained by intakes of ?100 mg/d
(Levine et al., 1996, 2001).  Higher concentrations of
ascorbic acid are observed in urine when plasma &ldquo;saturation&rdquo;
is attained (i.e. intakes of ?200 mg/d).  The vitamin&nbsp;C
requirements of an individual can potentially be determined
by administering a test dose of vitamin&nbsp;C and monitoring the
resultant excretion.  The specificity of urinary ascorbic
acid, however, is also low.  The drugs aminopyrine, aspirin,
barbiturates, hydantoins, and paraldehyde can all increase
urinary ascorbic acid excretion (Sauberlich, 1981).  An
additional disadvantage of this test as a measure of
ascorbic acid status in humans is the requirement for 24h
urine specimens.  The latter are impractical in field
studies and best collected in clinical or research settings.
19.11.1.  Measurement of urinary ascorbic acid Ascorbic acid
is unstable in urine and samples are ideally kept at 4°C and
stabilized with a metal chelator (e.g.  DTPA) and
acidification (e.g. with metaphosphoric acid) as soon as
possible after collection.  HPLC with electrochemical
detection is the preferred method of analysis.  Values can
be presented as amount excreted per hour or day, or relative
to urine creatinine concentrations for spot collections, to
account for urine concentration. 19.12 Ascorbic acid in
other cells and fluids Ascorbic acid has been detected in a
number of other body fluids.  The concentrations in saliva
and alveolar lining fluid are generally relatively low and
do not appear to correlate with concentrations of ascorbic
acid in plasma, leukocytes, or dietary intakes (Leggott et
al., 1986; Jacob et al., 1987; Bui et al., 1992).  In
contrast, ascorbic acid concentrations in cerebrospinal
fluid are typically higher than those found in plasma
(Tallaksen et al., 1992).  Ascorbic acid is able to bypass
the blood-brain barrier via SVCTs in the choroid plexus
(Angelo et al., 2003), and is believed to have important
functions in the central nervous system (May, 2012).  Of
note, concentrations of ascorbic acid in seminal fluid can
be up to 10-fold higher than those in plasma (Thiele et al.,
1995).  Lower seminal ascorbic acid concentrations were
observed in infertile men and this appeared to be related to
elevated oxidative stress (Thiele et al., 1995; Lewis et
al., 1997).  Buccal cell ascorbic acid concentrations have
been investigated as a potential biomarker of vitamin&nbsp;C
status.  In a vitamin&nbsp;C depletion–repletion study in healthy
men, buccal cell ascorbic acid concentrations were
significantly lower in subjects receiving low ascorbic acid
intakes (5, 10, 20 mg/d) compared with repletion intakes (60
or 250 mg/d) (Jacob et al., 1991).  Nevertheless, the
investigators concluded that buccal cells are probably not
suitable as a marker of ascorbic acid status over a broad
range of population intakes.  In contrast, muscle tissue
obtained by needle biopsy has been shown to correlate
relatively well with plasma concentrations and dietary
intake (Carr et a., 2013).  Muscle biopsy is a highly
invasive procedure, though, so is not typically undertaken
outside of research settings. 19.13 Body pool size Isotope
dilution techniques can be used to determine the size of the
body pool of vitamin&nbsp;C. The method involves administration
of an oral dose of 14C-labeled or 13C-labeled ascorbic acid,
followed by the measurement of the specific activity of
blood or urine ascorbate within 24–48 h (Baker et al., 1971;
Kallner et al., 1977).  Of the two radioactive isotopes, 14C
has a long half-life, so 13C, a shorter-lived isotope, is
preferred.  In young healthy male adults, the pool size of
ascorbic acid has been estimated to be ?1500 mg (i.e., 20
mg/kg body weight) (Baker et al., 1971; Kallner et al.,
1979).  In adult men, the total body pool of vitamin&nbsp;C
ranges in size from <300 mg to ~3000 mg, depending on the
daily intake of L-ascorbate.  When pool sizes are <600 mg of
vitamin&nbsp;C, psychological abnormalities have been reported
(Kinsman and Hood, 1971), whereas at concentrations <300 mg,
scurvy symptoms have been observed (Baker et al., 1971).
19.14 Functional tests of vitamin&nbsp;C status There are
currently no specific functional tests for vitamin&nbsp;C status.
Bleeding into the skin to form petechia, purpura and
ecchymoses are a sign of the vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency disease
scurvy.  As such, capillary fragility has been used in the
past as a functional test of vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency (Vilter,
1967).  However, this test can produce inconsistent results
in individuals with vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency and is not specific
to vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency states as other diseases may also
increase capillary fragility (Vilter, 1967).  Erythrocyte
fragility could be an alternative functional test of
deficiency (Tu et al., 2015, 2017), however, once again,
this is not specific for vitamin&nbsp;C deficiency.
Consequently, alternative functional tests of ascorbic acid
status need to be developed.  Specific markers of ascorbic
acid’s enzyme cofactor functions have been proposed.  On
example relates to collagen crosslinking (Munday et al,
2005).  In this study, urinary excretion of specific
crosslink ratios were higher in British children versus
Gambian children, and in Gambian children during the dry
season (characterised by high vitamin&nbsp;C intake and status)
versus the rainy season.  A supplementation study (100 mg/d
of vitamin&nbsp;C) in Gambian children during the rainy season
did not, however, alter the crosslink ratio.  This may have
been due to the supplementation period (7 weeks) being
insufficient, as collagen can have a long turnover in some
tissues.  Another possibility is assessment of vitamin
C-dependent epigenetic marks (Young et al., 2015), for
example in leukocytes.  One preliminary study has
demonstrated positive correlations between vitamin&nbsp;C status
and hydroxymethylcytosine and hydroxymethyluracil marks in
leukocyte DNA (Starczak et al., 2018).  Participants with
vitamin&nbsp;C concentrations >40&micro;mol/L exhibited significantly
higher concentrations of these epigenetic marks than those
with plasma concentrations <20&micro;mol/L.  As such, more
research in this area appears warranted.  Acknowledgements
