<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
The function of folate, in its various co-factor forms, is in
mediating one-carbon metabolism, a network of pathways
involving the transfer and utilization of single-carbon units,
including methylene, forminino, methyl, methenyl, and formyl
groups.  Folate is thus essential for key biolog&shy;ical functions,
including the biosynthesis of DNA, serine and glycine
metabolism, and methionine synthesis. Folate, in the form of
5&#8209;methyl&shy;tetra&shy;hydro&shy;folate,
along with vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> (as
methyl&shy;cobalamin), is required for the synthesis of methionine
from homo&shy;cys&shy;teine, and in turn the generation of
S&#8209;adenosyl&shy;methionine, a methyl group donor used in numerous
reactions, including the methy&shy;lation of DNA, RNA, proteins, and
phospho&shy;lipids. Clinical deficiency of folate is manifested as
mega&shy;loblastic anemia, characterized by abnormal cell replication
in the hemato&shy;poietic system, mega&shy;loblasts in the bone marrow
and macro&shy;cytes in the peripheral blood. The mega&shy;loblastic
anemia of folate deficiency is identical to that
of vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>
deficiency, and specific biomarker testing is essential to provide
a differential diagnosis. Folate-related anemia occurs commonly
in pregnant and lactating women in low- and middle-income
countries. Clinical folate deficiency is less common in
high-income countries, but subclinical deficiency is widespread,
especially in women of reproductive age and in the presence of
certain diseases and drugs. Notably, maternal folate nutrition
before and in early pregnancy plays a critical role in fetal
development, with conclusive scientific evidence that folic acid
supplementation in early pregnancy protects against the
occurrence of neural tube defects. Serum and red blood cell
(RBC) folate are the biomarkers used to assess folate status,
whilst plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine provides a functional indictor of
status.

<h2 id="22a.1">22a.1 Folate</h2>

Folate is a generic term referring to both natural folates and folic
acid (pteroyl&shy;monoglutamic acid, PGA), the synthetic form used
in supplements and fortified food. All folate forms comprise
three moieties: a pteridine; a p&#8209;amino&shy;benzoic acid (PABA) and a
glutamate residue
(<a href="#figure22a.1">Figure&nbsp;22a.1</a>).

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>The&nbsp;parent&nbsp; compound, PGA, is
completely oxidized and not found in nature. The natural folate
forms are reduced molecules, with the addition of 2&nbsp;or&nbsp;4
hydrogen atoms to the pteridine, giving rise to dihydro&shy;folate or
the various tetra&shy;hydro&shy;folate (THF) forms. THF can carry
one-carbon groups attached
at the N&#8209;5 (methyl, formyl or formimino),
the N&#8209;10 (formyl) or bridging N&#8209;5 and N&#8209;10 (methylene or
methenyl) positions of the pteridine ring, giving rise to a number
of different cofactor forms of folate.  Also, whereas folic acid is a
mono&shy;glutamate, containing only one glutamic acid residue, most natural
food folates exist as poly&shy;glutamate derivatives containing
additional glutamate residues bound in peptide linkage to the
gamma-carboxyl group.

Folate coenzymes are required for one-carbon meta&shy;bolism

<p></p>Folate is
thus essential for key biolog&shy;ical functions, including, serine and
glycine meta&shy;bolism, histidine cata&shy;bolism, methionine synthesis
and in thymidylate and purine bio&shy;synthesis, precursors of DNA.
Folate, in the form of 5&#8209;methylTHF,
along with vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>, is
required for the synthesis of methionine from homo&shy;cys&shy;teine
(catalyzed by the enzyme methionine synthase), and in turn, the
synthesis of S&#8209;adenosyl&shy;methionine (SAM). This methyl group donor
is used in numerous biolog&shy;ical methy&shy;lation reactions, including the
methy&shy;lation of a number of sites within DNA, RNA, proteins,
and phospho&shy;lipids. The reader is referred to Bailey et&nbsp;al.

<b>Folate inter&shy;action with other B&nbsp;vitamins.</b> For folate to function
within one-carbon meta&shy;bolism, it interacts closely with
vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>, vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub> and ribo&shy;flavin

Reduced folates
enter the one-carbon cycle as THF which acquires a carbon unit
from serine in a vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub>&#8209;dependent reaction to form 5,&nbsp;10
methyleneTHF. This co-factor form, once formed either
converted to 5&#8209;methylTHF or serves as the one-carbon donor in
the synthesis of nucleic acids, where it is required by thymidylate
synthetase in the conversion of deoxy&shy;uridine (dUMP) to
deoxy&shy;thymidine mono&shy;phosphate (dTMP) for pyrimidine
biosynthesis, or is converted to other folate forms required for
purine biosynthesis. Methylene&shy;tetra&shy;hydro&shy;folate reductase
(MTHFR) is a ribo&shy;flavin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the
reduction of 5,&nbsp;10 methyleneTHF to 5&nbsp;methylTHF, the folate form
used by methionine synthase for the vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>-dependent
conversion of homo&shy;cys&shy;teine to methionine and the formation of
THF.  Methionine is activated by ATP to form
S-adenosyl&shy;methionine (SAM), which then donates its methyl group
to more than 100&nbsp;methyl&shy;trans&shy;ferases for a wide range of
substrates such as DNA, hormones, proteins, neuro&shy;trans&shy;mitters
and membrane phospho&shy;lipids, all of which are regulators of
important physio&shy;logical processes

<span data-tippy-content="Bailey, L. B., Stover, P. J., McNulty, H., Fenech, M. F., Gregory, J. F., 3rd, Mills, J. L., Pfeiffer, C. M., Fazili, Z., Zhang, M., Ueland, P. M., Molloy, A.

In summary, effective folate functioning requires essential
meta&shy;bolic inter&shy;action with
vitamins&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>,&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub> and ribo&shy;flavin. Thus
sub-optimal status of one or more of these B&nbsp;vitamins, or
poly&shy;morphisms in folate genes, can impair one-carbon
meta&shy;bolism, even if folate status is sufficient.
<p></p>
<b>Absorption and transport of folate.</b> Folate absorption takes place
by an active process, primarily from the proximal part of the
jejunum.  Before absorption, the poly&shy;glutamate forms of folate
are decon&shy;jugated to the mono&shy;glutamate form in the gut by the
intestinal brush-border enzyme glutamate carboxy&shy;peptidase&nbsp;II
(GCPII), more commonly termed &ldquo;folate conjugase&rdquo;.  The
mono&shy;glutamates are then taken up by the mucosal cells. Folates
require transporters to cross cell membranes; these include the
reduced folate carrier (RFC), the proton-coupled folate
trans&shy;porter (PCFT), and the folate receptor proteins, FR&alpha; and
FR&beta;. Folic acid is a mono&shy;glutamate and thus does not require
decon&shy;jugation before uptake by intestinal cells.
<p></p>
Most of the folate mono&shy;glutamates absorbed from the gut are
transported to the liver (the major storage organ for folate) and
are reconverted intra&shy;cellularly within hepato&shy;cytes to
poly&shy;glutamate derivatives by the enzyme folyl&shy;poly&shy;glutamate
synthetase. These folate poly&shy;glutamates are stored in the liver or
converted to 5&#8209;methyl&shy;tetra&shy;hydro&shy;folate for secretion into the bile,
and then reabsorbed by way of the entero&shy;hepatic circulation.
This recircu&shy;lation process may account for as much as 50% of the
total folate that reaches the periph&shy;eral tissues.  Circulating folate
in blood is found in the mono&shy;glutamate form, predominantly as
5&#8209;methyl&shy;tetra&shy;hydro&shy;folate.

<h3 id="22a.1.2">22a.1.2 Deficiency of folate in humans</h3>

Severe deficiency of folate leads to megalo&shy;blastic anemia,
presenting as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath owing to
a low red blood cell count. This condition is hemato&shy;logically
characterized by the presence of immature, enlarged nucleated
cells, reflecting impaired DNA synthesis as a result of folate
depletion. Rapidly prolif&shy;erating cells are especially sensitive to
abnormalities in DNA synthesis.  Hence, the manifes&shy;tations of
folate defi&shy;ciency appear first in the hemato&shy;poietic system and
then in the epithelial cell surfaces and the gonads.  Abnormal cell
replication in the hemato&shy;poietic system, manifested by
hyper&shy;segmented neutro&shy;phils,
is one of the earliest morpho&shy;logical
changes. Later, megalo&shy;blasts appear in the bone marrow and
macro&shy;cytes in the peripheral blood. Some additional signs and
symptoms that have been reported with clinical folate defi&shy;ciency
include fatigue, angular cheilosis, anorexia, insomnia, glossitis,
recurrent aphthous ulcers, and pallor of the skin and mucous
membranes. Of note, the megalo&shy;blastic anemia resulting from
folate defi&shy;ciency is identical to that resulting from vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>
defi&shy;ciency, and therefore specific bio&shy;marker testing is essential to
provide a differential diagnosis (See Section&nbsp;22a.2).
<p></p>
<b>Causes of low and deficient folate status.</b> Folate defi&shy;ciency
arises from various causes, relating either to increased
requirements, reduced avail&shy;ability, or both. Pregnancy is a time
when folate requirement is greatly increased in order to sustain
the demand for rapid cell replication and growth of fetal,
placental and maternal tissue

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31155015/"
target="right" >McNulty et&nbsp;al., 2019</a>)</span>.

Gastro&shy;intestinal conditions, such as celiac disease, can also lead
to deficient folate status through chronic malab&shy;sorption. Certain
drugs, including phenytoin and primidone (anti&shy;convulsants) and
sulfa&shy;salazine (used in inflammatory bowel disease), are also
associated with folate defi&shy;ciency through adversely affecting
folate meta&shy;bolism. Like&shy;wise, heavy alcohol consumption and
smoking are also linked with lower folate status

<p></p>
<b>Prevalence of defi&shy;ciency.</b> Folate defi&shy;ciency occurs commonly in
pregnant and lactating women in low- and middle-income
countries, where it is reported to occur in &gt;&nbsp;20% of women of
repro&shy;ductive age

<span data-tippy-content="Rogers, L. M., Cordero, A. M., Pfeiffer, C. M., Hausman, D. B., Tsang, B. L., De-Regil, L. M., Rosenthal, J., Razzaghi, H., Wong, E. C., Weakland, A. P., & Bailey, L. B.

Here, dietary intakes of folate are often
inadequate to meet the high requirements of pregnancy.
<p></p>
In high-income countries, clinical folate defi&shy;ciency is less
common (due largely to the beneficial effects on folate status of
supple&shy;men&shy;tation and/or food fortifi&shy;cation), but
subclinical defi&shy;ciency (indicated by low serum and RBC&nbsp;folate
concen&shy;trations) is widespread, particularly in women of
reproductive age, especially if pregnant and lactating, in
European countries.  Low folate status has also been reported in
low birth weight and premature infants

sub-groups, depending on the method used and the cutoff points applied

<b>Neural tube defects.</b> Maternal folate nutrition before and in early
pregnancy is known to play a critical role in fetal development.
Notably, conclusive scientific evidence published 30y ago shows
that folic acid supple&shy;men&shy;tation
with folic acid (the synthetic form of the vitamin)
in early pregnancy protects against both first occurrence

of neural tube defects (NTDs). These major birth defects
occur as a result of a failure of the neural tube to close properly
in the first few weeks of pregnancy, leading to death of the fetus
or newborn, or to various disabilities involving the spinal cord,
the most common form of which is spina bifida. The conclusive
evidence that folic acid can prevent NTD has led to clear folic
acid recommendations for women of reproductive age which are
in place worldwide. It is important to appreciate, however, that
the risk of NTD is increased when maternal folate status is low,
but not necessarily within the range typically classed as folate
defi&shy;ciency.  In a large prospective study of women in Ireland
(where rates of NTD are among the highest in the world), a
woman's risk of having a child with an NTD was found to be
strongly associated with pregnancy RBC&nbsp;folate in a continuous
dose-response relation&shy;ship

<p></p>
In practice, implementing folic acid recommendations so that
women and their babies benefit, is somewhat challenging.
Although mandatory folic acid fortif&shy;ication of foods has proved
to be highly effective in reducing NTD wherever it has been
introduced (in&nbsp;84 countries worldwide), elsewhere preventable
NTDs are not being prevented including in European countries.
Notably, one recent study estimated that from 1998 to 2017, a
total of 95,213 NTD pregnancies have occurred amongst
104&nbsp;million births in 28&nbsp;European
countries; a prevalence of 0.92&nbsp;per 1,000&nbsp;births

This study concluded
that failure to implement mandatory folic acid fortif&shy;ication in the
28&nbsp;European countries continues to cause NTD to occur in almost
1,000&nbsp;preg&shy;nancies every year.
<p></p>
The precise mech&shy;anism explaining the beneficial effects of
peri&shy;concep&shy;tional folic acid against NTD remains uncertain,
though proposed mech&shy;anisms have focussed on factors that
impair normal folate meta&shy;bolism, including poly&shy;morphisms in
folate genes. Among the latter, an increased risk of NTD is most
strongly associated with the 677C&gt;T variant in the gene
encoding the folate-meta&shy;bolising enzyme
methylene&shy;tetra&shy;hydro&shy;folate reductase (MTHFR), as reported in
most studies and meta-analyses

Also, although low maternal folate is considered the major

<h3 id="22a.1.3">22a.1.3 Food folate sources,
bio&shy;avail&shy;ability and dietary intakes</h3>

Folates are widely distributed in animal and plant
foods, but only certain foods are rich sources, including liver,
yeast, green leafy vegetables, asparagus, beans, legumes, where
they exist primarily as poly&shy;glutamates, containing up to nine
glutamate residues attached to the <i>p</i>&#8209;amino&shy;benzoic group
of the molecule (<a href="#figure22a.1">Figure&nbsp;22a.1</a>).
In contrast, folic acid, the synthetic
vitamin, is a mono&shy;glutamate, containing only one glutamic acid
residue in its structure. Also, unlike folic acid, which is a fully
oxidized molecule, natural folates are reduced at the 5,&nbsp;6,&nbsp;7
and 8&nbsp;positions of the pteridine ring and so are prone to oxidative
cleavage at the C9&#8209;N10 bond producing two degradation
products, a pteridine
and <i>p</i>&#8209;amino&shy;benzoyl&shy;glutamate, both of
which are inactive and cannot be biolog&shy;ically converted to any
active folate form.
<p></p>
<b>Folate bio&shy;avail&shy;ability.</b> Bioavail&shy;ability
refers to the proportion of
ingested nutrient that is absorbed and available for meta&shy;bolic
processes. Naturally-occurring food folates are only partially
bioavail&shy;able

<span data-tippy-content="McNulty, H., & Pentieva, K. (2004). Folate bioavailability. The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 63(4), 529&ndash;536.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15831124/"
target="right" >McNulty & Pentieva, 2004</a>)</span>.

Natural food folates
are reduced molecules, and therefore are inherently unstable
outside living cells. In addition, the ease with which folates are
released from different food matrices and their conversion to the
mono&shy;glutamate form before uptake by intestinal cells can vary
greatly. Folate bio&shy;avail&shy;ability
from different food sources is also
dependent on the presence of certain dietary constituents, that
may enhance folate stability during digestion, or inhibit
bio&shy;avail&shy;ability owing to specific inhibitors of deconjugation.
Thus, the bio&shy;avail&shy;ability of food folates from a mixed diet is
limited and highly variable. In addition, natural food folates
(particularly green vegetables) can be unstable during cooking,
and this can substantially reduce the folate content of a food
before it is ingested

<span data-tippy-content="McKillop, D. J., Pentieva, K., Daly, D., McPartlin, J. M., Hughes, J., Strain, J. J., Scott, J. M., & McNulty, H. (2002).

This is an additional

food folates to positively influence folate status

<p></p>
<b>Dietary folates.</b> In contrast to the natural folate forms which have
limited stability and bio&shy;avail&shy;ability,
folic acid provides a highly
stable and bio&shy;available vitamin form.
The bio&shy;avail&shy;ability of folic
acid is assumed to be 100% when ingested as a supple&shy;ment,
while folic acid in fortified food is estimated to have about 85%
the bio&shy;avail&shy;ability of supple&shy;mental folic acid

These differences have led to the develop&shy;ment of &ldquo;dietary
folate equivalents&rdquo; or DFE values; more details are given in
Section&nbsp;8a.  Briefly, expressing dietary folate intakes and
recommend&shy;ations in DFE terms, allows an adjust&shy;ment for the
differences in bio&shy;avail&shy;ability
between natural food folates and the
synthetic vitamin. The DFE is defined as the quantity of natural
food folate plus 1.7&nbsp;times the quantity of folic acid in the diet;
this definition is based on the assumption that the bio&shy;avail&shy;ability
of folic acid added to food is greater than that of natural food
folate by a factor of 1.7

<b>Fortified foods as a source of folate.</b> Food fortif&shy;ication, the
process of adding essential micro&shy;nutrients to food, plays an
important role in facilitating a more optimal nutritional status in
individuals and populations. In the case of folate, it plays a
crucial role. Folic acid, the folate form used for food fortif&shy;ication,
is cheap to produce, very stable once added to foods and highly
bioavailable when ingested. Thus, depending on national
fortif&shy;ication policy and/or access to folic acid-fortified foods, the folate
status of populations can vary greatly from one country to the
next This is reflected in differences in health outcomes
(notably in relation to NTD risk). Food fortif&shy;ication may be
under&shy;taken on a voluntary or mandatory basis. Voluntary
fortif&shy;ication, whereby folic acid is added to foods such as
break&shy;fast cereals at the discretion of the manufac&shy;turer, is
permitted in most European countries. This results in higher
folate intake and status

<span data-tippy-content="Hopkins, S. M., Gibney, M. J., Nugent, A. P., McNulty, H., Molloy, A. M., Scott, J. M., Flynn, A., Strain, J. J., Ward, M., Walton, J., & McNulty, B. A. (2015).

but the benefit is
limited only to consumers who choose to eat the fortified food
products. However, when fortif&shy;ication is undertaken on a
mandatory (population-wide) basis, including in the USA,
Canada, Australia and Chile, it has proved to be highly effective,
not only in increasing folate status and reducing folate defi&shy;ciency

<b>Effects of high intakes of folate.</b> High folate intakes are
generally not assoc&shy;iated with any adverse effects.  However,
there are concerns of potential adverse effects of excess intakes
of folate acid, the synthetic vitamin form. Excessive folic acid
intake consti&shy;tutes exposure doses that exceed the Tolerable
Upper Intake Level (UL) of 1000&micro;g/d for adults, as set by the
U.S. Institute of Medicine

Historically the concern regarding excess folic acid focused on
the potential to mask pernicious anemia and exacerbation of the
clinical effects of vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> defi&shy;ciency. More recently other
concerns have been raised, including potential adverse effects on
cancer risk, birth outcomes, and other diseases. However, a
recent report from a 2019 expert workshop tasked with reviewing
this research area, concluded that there is an insufficient body of
evidence to support adverse human health outcomes as a result of
high intakes of folic acid. None&shy;theless, these experts called for
further research to determine the safety of excess folic acid intake

In 2015, an expert international panel produced a

This review identified serum folate, red blood cell (RBC) folate
and plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine as the &ldquo;Priority
Folate Biomarkers&rdquo; for
assessing folate status. Serum folate reflects recent dietary intake.
RBC&nbsp;folate, compared with serum folate, is a better indicator of
folate intake and status over the previous 3&ndash;4mos. Plasma
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine provides a functional indicator of folate status and
is elevated in folate defi&shy;ciency, on the basis that
normal homo&shy;cys&shy;teine meta&shy;bolism requires an adequate supply of
folate. Concentrations of folate in erythro&shy;cytes, but not serum,
also fall in vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> defi&shy;ciency. Ideally,
both serum and RBC&nbsp;folate concen&shy;trations should be measured.

<b>Cut-off values for assessment of folate status.</b>
The sequential stages in the development of folate defi&shy;ciency
were originally estab&shy;lished through detailed depletion / repletion
experiments conducted during the late 1960's, providing a basis for

The initial stage of folate defi&shy;ciency, termed negative folate
balance, is consistent with serum folate values of &lt;&nbsp;7nmol/L

If the negative balance persists, tissue folate
becomes depleted, as indicated by RBC&nbsp;folate falling below the
normal range to &lt;&nbsp;363nmol/L.  At this second stage, there is little
evidence that biochemical function is impaired, although plasma
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine concen&shy;trations may be slightly elevated. By the
third stage, termed folate-deficient erythropoiesis, functional
impairment is usually evident, with erythrocyte folate values
&lt;&nbsp;272nmol/L.  Tissue folate stores are severely depleted in the
fourth and final stage where the classical hematological changes
occur, manifested as folate-defi&shy;ciency anemia.  These include
macro-ovalocytic erythro&shy;cytes in the circulating blood and
megaloblasts in the bone marrow.  At this stage, hypersegmented
neutro&shy;phils in the peripheral blood smear and abnormal RBC
indices are also apparent; mean red cell volume and mean cell
hemo&shy;globin are elevated and hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;tration is low.

More recently, revised cut-off points for
folate defi&shy;ciency (serum folate &lt;10nmol/L and

Red cells contain much higher folate concen&shy;trations than serum.
5&#8209;methyl&#8209;THF poly&shy;glutamates are the main RBC&nbsp;folate forms.
The measure&shy;ment of RBC&nbsp;folate is more complex than that of
serum folate, because of the need to convert poly&shy;glutamates to
mono&shy;glutamates prior to analysis. In individuals homo&shy;zygous for
the <i>MTHFR</i> C677&gt;T poly&shy;morphism, a portion of the

Consequently, RBC&nbsp;folate
concen&shy;trations fall, despite the presence of normal (or sometimes

vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> defi&shy;ciency as well as folate defi&shy;ciency.

individuals, on average, have lower concen&shy;trations of serum (by

indicate that fasting is not essential when assessing the folate

Folate is the least stable of the B&nbsp;vitamins
and is susceptible to oxidative degradation during preanalytical
sample handling and storage. Careful sample handling and use of
anti&shy;oxidants are therefore required to maintain sample integrity.
Blood for serum folate analysis should be processed and frozen
promptly. Although serum is generally preferred over plasma in
most labora&shy;tories, both matrices generally produce comparable
results for folate, as long as the sample processing is not
delayed. If delays are unavoidable, the sample should be
protected from light, kept cool and processed within a few days
of collection. Folate in serum and hemolysates (but not in whole
blood) can withstand a few short freeze / thawing cycles,
particularly if the vials are kept closed as much as possible to
minimize the exposure of the sample to air. Folate in
serum / plasma degrades rapidly at room temperature, particularly
in the presence of EDTA.

<b>Analytical methodologies for measure&shy;ment of serum and RBC&nbsp;folate</b>
<p></p>
Over the past 50y, analytical methods to assess serum and RBC
folate concen&shy;trations have been continuously improved; however,
they have not yet reached the point where they produce
sufficiently comparable results across methods or labora&shy;tories.
The within-person variability for serum folate is about twice that
for RBC&nbsp;folate (CV of 21.5%  and 9.1%, respectively,

<b>Critical considerations in folate assess&shy;ment.</b> Assessing folate
status is complicated by the large number of folate forms that
may be readily interconverted.  To overcome this problem,
micro&shy;bio&shy;logical assays have been used for many decades due to
the ability of some bacteria to grow in the presence of many
different forms of folate, i.e. <i>L.rhamnosus</i> responds to all active
mono&shy;glutamate forms (see below). Subsequently, assays using
competitive protein binding became common because of their
simplicity. In more recent years, the use of LC&#8209;MS/MS has
emerged. Of note, the emergence of LC&#8209;MS/MS enables
investigation of relevant research findings related to folate
meta&shy;bolism. These include alterations in the relative proportion
of different folate forms in red cells owing to the common <i>MTHFR</i> C677&gt;T
poly&shy;morphism, along with an overall lower
RBC&nbsp;folate

There are three main method types for measure&shy;ment of serum
and RBC&nbsp;folate, each with advantages and disad&shy;van&shy;tages

<span data-tippy-content="Bailey, L. B., Stover, P. J., McNulty, H., Fenech, M. F., Gregory, J. F., 3rd, Mills, J. L., Pfeiffer, C. M., Fazili, Z., Zhang, M., Ueland, P. M., Molloy, A.

<p></p>
<b>Microbiolog&shy;ical assay.</b> This is widely considered to be the gold
standard assay for serum and RBC total folate because it
measures all biolog&shy;ically active forms equally and does not
measure folate species that lack vitamin activity. The underlying
principle of the micro&shy;biolog&shy;ical assay is that a folate-dependent
micro&shy;organism, namely <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> (formerly
called <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>), grows proportionally to the amount of
folate present in serum or whole blood and the folate
concen&shy;tration can be quantified by measuring the turbidity of the
inoculated medium after a 2d incubation.
A chloramphenicol-resistant strain of <i>L.rhamnosus</i>
is used and the assay is
performed using automated micro&shy;titer plate technology.
<p></p>
The key advantages of the micro&shy;biolog&shy;ical assay include its
excellent sensitivity, low cost and simple instrumentation (thus
suited for low-resource settings), and the fact that it can be used
with dried blood spot samples. The high sensitivity is a particular
advantage when limited volume is available, such as for samples
collected from a fingerstick or dried blood spot. The
disad&shy;van&shy;tages are that the micro&shy;biolog&shy;ical assay is relatively
laborious unless automated liquid handling is introduced, lengthy
assay time with limited throughput and limited linear range (thus
requiring dilution of samples). It is also prone to contamination
issues and potential inter&shy;ference by the presence of antibiotics or
anti&shy;folates. The latter limitation is well recognized, but in
practice may not be such an issue, in that analysts in the US
reported that &lt;&nbsp;1% of samples from the population-based
NHANES cohort exhibited a pattern of inter&shy;ference due to the
presence of anti&shy;biotics or anti&shy;folates

<p></p>
<b>Protein-binding assays.</b> These assays were developed primarily
for clinical settings, to enable the diagnosis of folate defi&shy;ciency.
Protein-binding assays use the highly specific folate-binding
protein to extract folate from the sample. The strengths of this
approach include the high sample throughput, quick turn&shy;around
time, avail&shy;ability in commercial kit form and minimum operator
involvement.  The disad&shy;van&shy;tages are that the various folate forms
have different affinities to folate-binding protein, the
ques&shy;tion&shy;able accuracy when mixtures of folate are present, the
limited linear range (thus requiring dilution of samples), matrix
effects when sample is diluted, and lot-to-lot variability of
commercial kits. Also, although not sensitive to anti&shy;biotics,
protein-binding assays are influenced by certain anti&shy;folates such
as metho&shy;trexate.
<p></p>
<b>Chromatography-based assays (HPLC-FD, LC&#8209;MS/MS).</b>
Chromatography-based methods typically provide information on
individual folate forms based on measure&shy;ment of intact folates
via HPLC. More recently, LC-tandem mass spec&shy;trometry
(LC&#8209;MS/MS) is now the preferred detection for HPLC-based methods
in specialized labora&shy;tories. Advantages of chromatography-based
approaches are that they measure all folate forms, are highly
selective and specific, have good sensitivity and precision, enable
in-house control of perform&shy;ance and use of stable-isotope-labeled
internal standards to compensate for procedural losses. Ensuring
accurate calibration is a big task for chrom&shy;atography-based
methods, due to the high number of folate forms and also because
of their instability. Disadvan&shy;tages include the high costs and
require&shy;ment for expensive instru&shy;men&shy;tation, experienced operator
and frequent technical service, along with being a relatively
laborious approach unless automated liquid handling is
introduced, and the requirement for complex sample
extraction / cleanup. Also inter&shy;conversions of folate forms during
the assay procedure need to be considered in inter&shy;pretation of
data.
<p></p>
<b>Cut-off values and Interpretation of Serum and RBC&nbsp;folate</b>
<p></p>
The measure&shy;ment of total folate provides information on the
folate status of the individual, either in the short-term through
serum folate, or in the long-term through RBC&nbsp;folate.
An historical pers&shy;pec&shy;tive on the use of folate cutoffs is provided
in <a href="#Box22a.1">Box&nbsp;22a.1</a>.
However, the inconsistent use of cutoff values
over time to assess the proportion of populations with deficient or
low folate status led to a certain degree of confusion. More
recently, revised cut-off points for folate defi&shy;ciency (serum folate
&lt;&nbsp;10nmol/L and RBC&nbsp;folate &lt;&nbsp;340nmol/L) have been defined
based on the meta&shy;bolic indicator, plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine

Of note, the values were

<p></p>
As discussed earlier, the risk of NTD is associated with a
maternal folate status that would not conventionally be classed as
deficient. Although there is no cutoff value estab&shy;lished by
international organizations for folate concen&shy;trations to define
NTD risk in populations, it is accepted that the number of NTDs
that can be prevented in a population is dependent on maternal
folate status.  Specifically, RBC&nbsp;folate concen&shy;tration in the
mother has been shown to be a sensitive bio&shy;marker of NTD risk.

<h3 id="22a.2.2">22a.2.2 Plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine concen&shy;trations</h3>

Plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine provides a sensitive
functional indicator of folate status. On the basis that normal
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine meta&shy;bolism requires an adequate supply of folate,
plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine becomes elevated when folate status is low.
<p></p>
Homo&shy;cys&shy;teine is a four-carbon, thiol-containing amino acid
found in human plasma, mostly present in the form of various
disulfides, such as homo&shy;cys&shy;teine-cysteine disulfide. About 75%
of total homo&shy;cys&shy;teine is bound to protein (mainly albumin),
whereas the remainder occurs in nonprotein-bound &ldquo;free&rdquo; forms.
Total homo&shy;cys&shy;teine is defined
as the sum of all homo&shy;cys&shy;teine
species in serum or plasma, including free and protein-bound
forms. Only a very small portion (1&ndash;2%) of plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine
is present as the thiol, however the relative contribution of the
thiol to total homo&shy;cys&shy;teine increases to 10&ndash;25% in patients with
abnormally elevated plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine

<p></p>
Homo&shy;cys&shy;teine is derived from the essential amino acid,
methionine. It is meta&shy;bolized in two ways:
remethyl&shy;ation to methionine (by methionine synthase) or
trans&shy;sulfur&shy;ation to cysta&shy;thionine
(by cystathionine beta-synthase;
CBS) then to cysteine
(<a href="#figure22a.2">Figure&nbsp;22a.2</a>).
These pathways require
adequate status of folate and the meta&shy;bolically related
B&#8209;vitamins. The remethyl&shy;ation pathway, whereby methionine is
synthesized from homo&shy;cys&shy;teine by methionine synthase, is
dependent on both folate and vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> as cofactors, whilst the
trans&shy;sulfuration pathway that converts homo&shy;cys&shy;teine to cysteine
is catalyzed by two vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub> dependent enzymes. A fourth
B&nbsp;vitamin, ribo&shy;flavin, is required in its cofactor
form flavin adenine
dinucleo&shy;tide (FAD) for the activity of MTHFR, the enzyme that
catalyzes the reduction of 5,10&nbsp;methyl&shy;eneTHF to 5&nbsp;methylTHF.
Once formed, 5&nbsp;methylTHF is used by methionine synthase for
the vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>-dependent conversion of homo&shy;cys&shy;teine to
methionine and the formation of THF.  Thus, the concen&shy;tration of
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine in plasma / serum is regulated by up to four
B&#8209;vitamins: folate, vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>,
vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub> and ribo&shy;flavin.
<p></p>
Apart from providing a functional bio&shy;marker of folate, higher
plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine is associated with a number of chronic

It remains to be estab&shy;lished,
however, whether plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine
<i>per se</i> a risk factor for these
or other diseases. In the case of CVD, this issue is particularly
contro&shy;versial. Despite strong and consistent evidence from
observational studies over many years, several secondary
prevention trials published between 2004 and 2014 failed to
demon&shy;strate a benefit of homo&shy;cys&shy;teine-lowering therapy against
the recurrence of CVD events in patients with existing disease.
The evidence is however stronger for the relation&shy;ship of
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine with stroke than heart disease, with good evidence
from both population data and randomized trials that folic acid
intervention and/or homo&shy;cys&shy;teine-lowering can signif&shy;icantly
reduce the risk of stroke, and particularly so in people with no
previous history of stroke

Of note, although the literature in this area focuses
on homo&shy;cys&shy;teine as the
CVD risk factor, it is possible that folate and related B&#8209;vitamins
have roles in CVD that are independent of their
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine-lowering effects.
Thus, plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine may be linked with
CVD as a functional marker of low B&#8209;vitamin status which
reliably reflects perturbed one-carbon meta&shy;bolism, rather than
being causatively related to CVD <i>per&nbsp;se</i>

<b>Factors affecting homo&shy;cys&shy;teine concen&shy;trations</b>
<p></p>
<b>Folate status.</b> On the basis that normal
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine meta&shy;bolism
requires an adequate supply of folate, plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine is
first and foremost affected by folate status. Thus, plasma
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine was shown to respond within 3&ndash;4wks of folate
depletion (increase) and subsequent repletion (decrease) in a
controlled meta&shy;bolic study in healthy women

<span data-tippy-content="Jacob, R. A., Gretz, D. M., Taylor, P. C., James, S. J., Pogribny, I. P., Miller, B. J., Henning, S. M., & Swendseid, M. E. (1998).

Like&shy;wise, in observational studies, plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine is
invariably found to be inversely associated with folate status,
whether measured as serum or RBC&nbsp;folate.
<p></p>
<b>Intervention with folic acid.</b> Plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine is highly
responsive to intervention with folic acid (the synthetic vitamin
form), alone or in combination with
vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>, vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub>,
ribo&shy;flavin and betaine (or choline). Thus, food fortif&shy;ication with
folic acid has marked effects on homo&shy;cys&shy;teine concen&shy;trations.

comparing values pre-fortif&shy;ication (1991&ndash;1994) to
post-fortif&shy;ication (1999&ndash;2004) of food with folic acid, as implemented on a
mandatory basis in 1996&ndash;1998. Folic acid-fortif&shy;ication on a
voluntary basis (i.e. added to food at the manufacturer's
discretion) also affects plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine. In a convenience
sample of nearly 500&nbsp;healthy adults in Northern
Ireland aged 18&ndash;92y, who were not taking folic acid supplements,
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine concen&shy;trations were lower by 2&micro;mol/L in high
consumers compared to non-consumers of fortified foods
(providing &gt;&nbsp;100&micro;g/d and 0&micro;g/d folic acid, respectively)

<b>Folate-related B&nbsp;vitamins.</b> Because normal homo&shy;cys&shy;teine
meta&shy;bolism is dependent on four B&nbsp;vitamins, homo&shy;cys&shy;teine
concen&shy;trations will be elevated with other B&nbsp;vitamin deficiencies
apart from folate, notably vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>

<b>Ethnic and genetic effects.</b> Plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine may also differ
among ethnic groups, but these differences appear to be less
important than the influence of B&nbsp;vitamin status. Notably, the
most common genetic cause of elevated homo&shy;cys&shy;teine in the
general population is homozygosity for the MTHFR C677&gt;T
poly&shy;morphism (affecting an estimated 10% of people worldwide
but much higher in some populations, including Mexico and
Northern China). This folate gene variant also contributes to a
higher risk of blood pressure throughout the lifecycle,
particularly when combined with deficient status of ribo&shy;flavin,
which is required as a cofactor for MTHFR, a key folate
meta&shy;bolizing enzyme

<b>Inborn errors of meta&shy;bolism.</b> Homocystinuria refers to rare inborn
errors of meta&shy;bolism which lead to severely increased
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine concen&shy;trations in plasma,
usually &gt;&nbsp;100&micro;mol/L,
along with large amounts excreted in urine. The most common
cause of homo&shy;cystin&shy;uria is defi&shy;ciency of the enzyme
cysta&shy;thionine &beta;&#8209;synthase (CBS).
CBS defi&shy;ciency, an autosomal
recessive condition, has a reported world&shy;wide birth prevalence of
1 in 344,000, while that in Ireland the frequency is much higher,
at 1 in 65,000, based on newborn screening and cases detected
clinically. These patients have a high risk of premature,
frequently fatal, throm&shy;boembolic events. Early diagnosis and
treatment with pyridoxine and/or folic acid and betaine,
preferably from infancy, can however prevent CVD events and
most of the clinical symptoms

plasma is separated from the red blood cells within 1hr of
blood collection (or within 8&nbsp;hours if the whole blood is kept on

various method types are available for homo&shy;cys&shy;teine determination.
These range from fully automated commercial kits (immunoassay
or enzymatic methods) to chrom&shy;atographic assays with mass
spec&shy;trometry detection, overall providing comparable results and
good assay performance. All methods require the reduction of the
disulfide bonds to allow measure&shy;ment of
total homo&shy;cys&shy;teine. The

put forward the following recommendations to help in making this decision:
<ul>
<li>Using commercial kits (either immunoassay
or enzymatic assay) on a fully-automated clinical analyzer
will provide the highest throughput and quickest
turnaround time with the least effort. The main
disad&shy;van&shy;tage is the relatively high reagent costs, which can
make the measure&shy;ments quite expensive, particularly for a
large number of samples.
<li>If an HPLC system with fluorescence detector
is available, setting up a manual assay may be the least
expensive approach, particularly in settings with low labor
costs. The disad&shy;van&shy;tage of the manual HPLC assay is that
the number of samples that can be run is quite limited
(typically to about 50&ndash;70 unknown samples per analytical
run).
<li>If a labora&shy;tory has access to an existing
LC&#8209;MS/MS system and the required technical knowhow,
plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine can be measured in a high
throughput semi-automated manner, with quite low reagent
costs.  Due to the high initial cost, however, an
LC&#8209;MS/MS system is economical only if a large number of
samples are measured regularly.
<li>GC-MS or GC-MS/MS have also been used in
high throughput research settings, particularly when the
co-determination of methyl&shy;malonic acid and methionine is
of interest.
<li>GC-based methods provide better precision,
higher resolution, and longer column life compared to
LC-based methods and are not subject to ion suppression
issues, which can be a problem in LC&#8209;MS/MS methods.

<li>Each labora&shy;tory should establish reference limits for its region.
<li>The reference population should exclude individuals with
folate or cobalamin defi&shy;ciency or increased creatinine, and
patients with diseases or who are taking drugs that increase
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine concen&shy;trations.
<li>Separate reference limits for children, adults, the elderly,

<b>Neutro&shy;phil lobe count</b>
<p></p>
Usually, neutro&shy;phils have three or four segments, but in
megalo&shy;blastic anemia (owing to folate or vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>
defi&shy;ciency), this number increases.  Neutro&shy;phil
hyper&shy;segmentation can be evaluated in smears of peripheral
blood or in white blood cells obtained from the buffy coat (i.e.
interface between the serum / plasma and the sedimented red
cells), and may be the earliest morphological change to appear in
the blood in folate and&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> defi&shy;ciency. Neutro&shy;phil
hyper&shy;segmentation however is not specific to folate or&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>
defi&shy;ciency as it also occurs in other conditions including uremia,
myelo&shy;pro&shy;liferative disorders, myelo&shy;fibrosis and as a congenital
lesion in approximately 1%&nbsp;of the population, even when the
status of folate and vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> is adequate.  The observed
greater incidence of neutro&shy;phil hyper&shy;segmentation in iron
defi&shy;ciency anemia concurrent with folate and/or vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>
defi&shy;ciency implies interactive effects on the erythro&shy;poietic

<b>Serum folic acid</b>
<p></p>
Unmeta&shy;bolized (or &ldquo;free&rdquo;) folic acid can be present in varying
concen&shy;trations in plasma and is typically associated with higher
folic acid intake via fortified foods, supplements, or a
combination of both

Thus, cut-oﬀ values or desirable ranges have yet to be
identiﬁed. One randomized trial addressed concerns relating
to the potential for folic acid to exert
adverse biological effects in pregnancy, and demonstrated
that folic acid supplements taken at
recommended levels throughout pregnancy do not lead to
increased circulating unmetabolized folic acid in
mothers or their babies

However, the biological impacts and the signiﬁcance
for health in general of unmetabolized folic acid
in blood remain to be elucidated.
<p></p>
<b>Genomic bio&shy;markers of folate status</b>
<p></p>
<b>DNA cytosine methy&shy;lation.</b> Apart from its role in DNA
synthesis, folate plays an important role in DNA meta&shy;bolism as it
is required for the synthesis of methionine and thus SAM, which
in turn is required as a methyl donor for the maintenance of
cytosine methy&shy;lation, essential for silencing of genes or structural
integrity of specific regions of chrom&shy;osomes

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22093367/"
target="right" >Fenech, 2012</a>)</span>.

When SAM is depleted, the maintenance of DNA methy&shy;lation
may become compromised, leading to hypo&shy;methy&shy;lation of
cytosine and structural changes in chrom&shy;atin.  Some studies
suggest that global DNA methy&shy;lation status is reduced when
folate is deficient

but findings in this regard are somewhat inconsistent.
<p></p>
<b>Uracil misincorporation into DNA.</b> Measurement of uracil
content in DNA may also provide a bio&shy;marker of folate status, on
the basis that adequate amounts of folate as 5,10&#8209;methyl&shy;eneTHF
are required by thymidylate synthase to convert deoxy&shy;uridine
mono&shy;phosphate (dUMP) to thymidylate mono&shy;phosphate (dTMP)
in pyrimidine synthesis and thus DNA biosynthesis. If
5,10&#8209;methyl&shy;eneTHF is limiting as a substrate of thymidylate synthase,
dUMP accumulates and it becomes more probable that uracil is
incorporated into DNA instead of thymidine during DNA synthesis

<b>Micronuclei.</b> Micronuclei have the same morphological features
as normal nuclei but are much smaller. Excessive uracil

older children related to increased meta&shy;bolic demands for growth

<h2 id="22a.3">22a.3 Conclusions</h2>

Folate is required for one-carbon meta&shy;bolism and thus plays a
critical role in essential biolog&shy;ical processes, including amino
acid meta&shy;bolism, DNA synthesis and repair and methy&shy;lation
reactions. Low folate status leads to adverse health effects
throughout the lifecycle, even if not severe enough to cause
mega&shy;loblastic anemia, the clinical manifestation of folate
defi&shy;ciency. Thus, accurate assess&shy;ment of folate status is essential.
Serum and RBC folate concen&shy;trations are sensitive bio&shy;markers
used widely to assess folate status. Serum folate is the earliest
indicator of altered folate exposure and reflects recent dietary
intake, whilst RBC folate reflects tissue folate stores and is a
better indicator of folate intake over the previous 3&ndash;4 months
when circulating folate is incorporated into the maturating red
cells. On the basis that normal homo&shy;cys&shy;teine meta&shy;bolism requires
an adequate supply of folate, the measure&shy;ment of plasma
homo&shy;cys&shy;teine provides a sensitive functional indicator that will
be elevated with deficient or low folate status, but it is not a
specific folate bio&shy;marker as it is influenced by other nutrient
(most notably vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> defi&shy;ciency)
and non-nutrient factors
including renal function. Emerging genomic bio&shy;markers may
provide a reliable assess&shy;ment of genome pathology resulting
from deficient status to folate, to add to the core bio&shy;markers of
status, serum folate, RBC folate, and plasma homo&shy;cys&shy;teine.
