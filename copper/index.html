<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
The role of copper in human health and well-being is considered,
starting with copper metabolism, from uptake across the gut, to the liver and
the incorporation into cupro-enzymes.
Food sources of copper are noted, and the amount required to maintain health at
different stages of the life course given.
The consequences of copper deficiency are described, with data largely obtained from
inherited diseases of copper metabolism and from the rare cases of copper overload;
the effects of high copper are also discussed.
 Markers of copper status are assessed.
 Low serum copper levels are a marker of severe
 copper deficiency, but do not identify marginal copper deficiency
 Many factors, including infection and stress,
 modify serum copper levels, emphasising the
 unreliability of the indicator.  The majority of serum copper is bound to ceruloplasmin,
 and parameters that affect ceruloplasmin are also discussed. Other possible markers
 of copper status include cuproenzymes such as Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase,
 cytochrome oxidase, lysyl oxidase and diamine oxidase, but they are difficult to
 measure, and normal ranges have not been established. When inside cells, copper is
 bound to small proteins called chaperones. mRNA or protein levels of these
 chaperones have been proposed as markers of status, with varying degrees of
 acceptability. Other markers of copper status, such as hair or nail copper levels,
 are also considered, but are not ideal and can be altered by factors other than copper status.<p>

<h2>24b Copper </h2>
	
The adult human body contains
<span class="n">70&ndash;80mg</span> of
copper.  Of this, approximately 25&#37; is in the skeletal
muscle, 15&#37; in the skin, 15&#37; in the bone marrow, 19&#37; in the
skeleton, 8.0 to 15&#37; in the liver, and 8.0&#37; in the brain.
The liver and brain contain the highest concentrations of
copper. Like iron, copper can be found in two valences,
Cu<sup>+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and it is this ability to gain and lose
electrons that give the enzymes into which it is
incorporated their function, catalyzing oxidation-reduction
reactions.  Examples of copper enzymes (cupro-enzymes) are
given in

<h3>&bull;&nbsp;Functions of copper </h3>

Many clinical
features of copper deficiency can be explained by changes in
the activities of cupro&shy;enzymes.  For instance, the
ferr&shy;oxidases, of which there are several examples, are
involved in oxidising Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> to facilitate iron
incorporation into trans&shy;ferrin.  Cerulo&shy;plasmin, a&nbsp;serum
protein, was the first to be identified.  A&nbsp;reduction in
cerulo&shy;plasmin (ferr&shy;oxidase&nbsp;I) (EC&nbsp;1.16.3.1) impairs the
transport of iron to the erythro&shy;poietic sites, leading to
hypo&shy;chromic anemia.  Hephaestin is located on the
baso&shy;lateral membrane of gut cells

<span data-tippy-content="Vulpe, C. D., Kuo, Y. M., Murphy, T. L., Cowley, L., Askwith, C., Libina, N., Gitschier, J., & Anderson, G. J. (1999). Hephaestin, a ceruloplasmin homologue implicated in intestinal iron transport, is defective in the sla mouse. Nature genetics, 21(2), 195–199. ">

The membrane bound form of cerulo&shy;plasmin is pre&shy;dominantly
located in the brain

while zyklopen is central to trans-placental transfer of iron, though it is
also located in retinal cells

<p>
Deficiency of the cupro&shy;enzyme lysyl oxidase (EC&nbsp;1.4.3.13)
may be responsible for the skeletal and vascular defects
reported in copper deficiency.  Lysyl oxidase is essential
for the normal maturation of collagen, specifically in the
steps involving the formation of lysine-derived cross-links

<span data-tippy-content="O’Dell BL. (1976). Biochemistry of copper. Medical
Clinics of North America 60: 687–703.">

The latter are required for the formation
of strong, flexible con&shy;nective tissues

<p>
Depigment&shy;ation is often associated with a&nbsp;deficiency
of tyro&shy;sinase (EC&nbsp;1.14.18.1), an enzyme involved in the
production of melanin.  The latter is necessary for
protection against excess ultra&shy;violet exposure.  The central
nervous system disturb&shy;ances in copper deficiency are the
result of myelin&shy;ization derange&shy;ments or of abnormal
catechol&shy;amine levels and associated decreased activity of
dopamine &beta; mono&shy;oxygen&shy;ase (EC&nbsp;1.14.17.1) or reduced activity
of cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c oxid&shy;ase (EC&nbsp;1.9.3.1)

<h3>&bull;&nbsp;Absorption and metabolism of copper</h3>

 The major site of copper
absorption is the small intestine, although some copper is
also absorbed from the stomach.  Absorption is inversely
related to the amount of copper in the diet, decreasing the
likelihood of deficiency and toxicity

men at three levels of dietary copper by use of the

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2718922/"
target="right" >Turnlund et&nbsp;al., 1989</a>).</span>

For dietary intakes above 5mg/d, absorption is
&lt;&nbsp;20&#37;, whereas for intakes &lt;&nbsp;1mg/d, absorp&shy;tion is as high as
50&#37;

 <p>
As noted above, on the apical membrane, facing the gut,
copper is taken up by a&nbsp;carrier mediated process, involving
a transporter named Ctr1

(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16365053/"
target="right" >Kuo et&nbsp;al., 2006</a>).</span>

Following uptake, the Cu is transferred across the cell and
excreted into the portal circulation using an
energy-dependent process and a&nbsp;Cu-ATPase, known as ATP7A

<span data-tippy-content="Harris E. D. (2000). Cellular copper transport and metabolism. Annual review of nutrition, 20, 291–310.">

This enzyme is deficient in Menkes disease
patients, and its absence is responsible for the subsequent
copper deficiency.  It is mostly located in the gut, but it
also plays an important role in trans-placental transport
and may be involved in uptake across the blood brain barrier

<span data-tippy-content="Hardman, B., Manuelpillai, U., Wallace, E. M., van de Waasenburg, S., Cater, M., Mercer, J. F., & Ackland, M. L. (2004). Expression and localization of menkes and Wilson copper transporting ATPases in human placenta. Placenta, 25(6), 512–517.">

<p>
Once absorbed, copper
is trans&shy;ported via the portal blood, bound to albumin and
trans&shy;cuprein, mainly to the liver.  In the liver, copper is
incorporated into cerulo&shy;plasmin, and then dis&shy;tributed to
other tissues.  For further details, see the review by Linder et&nbsp;al.

<p>
At present, the mechanisms of copper regulation are only
beginning to be under&shy;stood.  Tissue copper con&shy;cen&shy;trations
are main&shy;tained within a&nbsp;narrow range, through homeo&shy;static
mechanisms that operate at the level of intestinal
absorption and biliary excretion.  Of the two levels,
biliary excretion is the more important.  As more copper is
absorbed, turnover is faster, and, hence, more copper is
excreted into the gastro&shy;intes&shy;tinal tract.  Very little
copper is excreted in the urine, and urinary losses do not
help regulate copper stores.  Relatively little copper is
stored in the body, compared with other trace elements such
as iron

<p>
Copper is taken into the gut cell through Ctr1.  In the
cell, and in fact in all other cells apart from red blood
cells, copper is bound to one of a&nbsp;series of chaperones.
The first to be identified was Atox1, followed by several
others, each of which takes copper from the membrane
transporter to specific target proteins

The copper is trans&shy;ported across the cell,
excreted into the portal circulation through the enzyme
which is defective in Menkes disease, ATP7A and trans&shy;ferred
to the liver bound to albumin, trans&shy;cuprein or as a&nbsp;
low-molecular weight complex with histidine or other amino acids

<p>
Within the liver, Cu is stored as metallo&shy;thionein,
re-excreted in the bile or incorp&shy;orated into cerulo&shy;plasmin.
Excretion and Cp incorp&shy;oration both involve a&nbsp;second
Cu-ATPase, ATP7B.  ATPB is a&nbsp;membrane protein, which changes
location in the liver ER, depending on whether the copper
being trans&shy;ported is excreted or incorp&shy;orated into
cerulo&shy;plasmin

Most of the reports of copper deficiency in humans
have resulted from inadequate dietary intakes of copper,
often associated with pro&shy;longed diarrhea, which prevents
reabsorp&shy;tion of copper from the bile.  Hence, it is not
surprising that subjects with mal&shy;absorp&shy;tion
syn&shy;dromes &mdash;
including tropical sprue, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis,
and short-bowel syndrome resulting from intestinal resection
&mdash; are at risk of copper deficiency

<h3>&bull;&nbsp;Food sources and dietary intakes </h3>

Copper is widely
distributed in foods; the richest food sources are oysters,
other shellfish, organ meats (e.g., liver, kidney), nuts,
and dried legumes.  Milk and dairy products are low in
copper.  The copper level in plants is not influenced by the
copper content of the soil in which they grow

<h3>&bull;&nbsp;Indices of copper status</h3>

The methods used to assess copper status in humans include
static tests, as well as the measurement of the activities
of certain copper enzymes.  These methods are discussed
below.  Other approaches use cate&shy;gorical regression to
determine the optimal levels of copper in the diet



<span data-tippy-content="Chambers, A., Krewski, D., Birkett, N., Plunkett, L., Hertzberg, R., Danzeisen, R., Aggett, P. J., Starr, T. B., Baker, S., Dourson, M., Jones, P., Keen, C.

There is still no consensus on the best bio&shy;marker to use, in part, because of
the efficiency of the homeo&shy;static control that maintains
tissue copper concen&shy;trations within a&nbsp;narrow range



<span data-tippy-content="Harvey, L. J., & McArdle, H. J. (2008). Biomarkers of copper status: a&nbsp;brief update. The British journal of nutrition, 99 Suppl 3, S10–S13. ">

As a&nbsp;result, measures of copper status
tend to be resistant to change, except when dietary intakes
are very low or very high.  Serum copper or serum
cerulo&shy;plasmin are most often used to assess copper status,
but the sensitivity and specificity of both these measures
are poor.  Hence, they should be combined with a&nbsp;more
sensitive and specific functional measure such as
cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c&nbsp;oxi&shy;dase in platelets
or super&shy;oxide dismu&shy;tase in
erythro&shy;cytes.  It is likely that in the future functional
indicators, perhaps including anti&shy;oxidant status, changes in
immune function, and the lysyl oxidase activity in skin,
will be used in conjunction with other biochemical markers.

<h3>24b.1 Serum copper </h3>

There are two main forms of copper in
serum; one is firmly bound to cerulo&shy;plasmin, the other is
reversibly bound to serum albumin. and to amino acids and
other, poorly defined components

<span data-tippy-content="Linder M. C. (2016). Ceruloplasmin and other copper binding components of blood plasma and their functions: an update. Metallomics : integrated biometal science, 8(9), 887–905. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27426697/"
target="right" >Linder 2016</a>).</span>

Serum also contains the two copper
enzymes cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c&nbsp;oxi&shy;dase and
mono&shy;amine oxidase.
<p>
Serum copper con&shy;cen&shy;trations are a
reliable bio&shy;marker in cases of severe copper deficiency,
when they are almost always low.  However, they are not
sensitive enough to be used as a&nbsp;measure of marginal copper
status, as noted earlier, and do not reflect dietary intake,
except when it is low.  Normally, sup&shy;plemen&shy;tation with
copper does not increase serum copper because con&shy;cent&shy;rations
are under strict homeo&shy;static control.  Levels are only
reduced after copper stores are signif&shy;icantly depleted.  In
healthy adults consuming diets adequate in copper, the lower
end of the normal range for serum copper is 10&micro;mol/L.
<p></p>
Experimental studies have also confirmed that serum copper is not
a sensitive index of marginal copper status in adults

<span data-tippy-content="Reiser, S., Smith, J. C., Jr, Mertz, W., Holbrook, J. T., Scholfield, D. J., Powell, A. S., Canfield, W. K., & Canary, J. J. (1985).

disease.  In Menkes kinky hair syndrome, low serum copper

In Wilson's disease, the low serum copper levels are induced by
defects in the hepatic storage of copper and in
cerulo&shy;plasmin meta&shy;bolism.

In contrast, concentrations of copper in serum and erythrocytes are
comparable, so slight hemolysis does not affect serum copper
concentrations.
<p>
More recently, examination of the
non-cerulo&shy;plasmin pool of copper, the exchange&shy;able fraction,
has suggested that this might be a&nbsp;good indicator of copper
overload, as in diseases such as Wilson's disease

<h3>&bull;&nbsp;Factors affecting serum copper</h3>

 It is important to remember that most assays do not
differentiate between the different forms of copper in serum
and usually, changes in &ldquo;serum copper" are generally caused
by alterations in the concen&shy;tration of cerulo&shy;plasmin.  The
vast majority of coper in serum is bound to cerulo&shy;plasmin.
Estimates vary from 60&#37; to 95&#37; with the remainder being
bound to a&nbsp;poorly characterised series of chelators

<span data-tippy-content="Linder M. C. (2016). Ceruloplasmin and other copper binding components of blood plasma and their functions: an update. Metallomics : integrated biometal science, 8(9), 887–905. ">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27426697/"
target="right" >Linder 2016</a>).</span>

As well as being a&nbsp;ferr&shy;oxidase, involved in iron
metabolism, cerulo&shy;plasmin is an acute phase protein, and
concen&shy;trations can be altered by other factors than copper
status.  This makes interpretation of the changes described
below complex.
<p></p>
<b>Age-related</b> changes in serum copper
concen&shy;trations are well documen&shy;ted.  Newborn infants have
low values, which rise to adult levels by 6 to 12mo of age

increase with age until

<h3>24b.2	Serum ceruloplasmin </h3>

Ceruloplasmin is the major copper-containing protein in the &alpha;2-globulin
fraction of human serum.  More than 60&#37; to 95&#37; of serum
copper is associated with cerulo&shy;plasmin

<span data-tippy-content="Wirth, P. L., & Linder, M. C. (1985). Distribution of copper among components of human serum. Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 75(2), 277–284.">
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3860683/"
target="right" >Wirth and Linder, 1985</a>),</span>

so changes in serum copper generally parallel the
level of cerulo&shy;plasmin in the blood.
<p>
Cerulo&shy;plasmin (EC&nbsp;1.16.3.1)
is a&nbsp;copper transport protein synthesized
primarily in the liver.  It is a&nbsp;single-chain glyco&shy;protein
with six copper atoms per molecule.  A&nbsp;ferr&shy;oxidase, it
assists in iron transport by oxidizing intra&shy;cellular Fe<sup>2+</sup> to
Fe<sup>3+</sup>, which can then combine with trans&shy;ferrin.
Cerulo&shy;plasmin is also among those enzymes involved in the
acute-phase reaction of inflam&shy;mation and in the scavenging
of oxygen radicals to protect cells against oxidative damage

<span data-tippy-content="Linder, M. C., & Hazegh-Azam, M. (1996). Copper biochemistry and molecular biology. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 63(5), 797S–811S.">

target="right" >Linder and Hazegh-Azam, 1996</a>).</span>
<p>
Cerulo&shy;plasmin levels in
serum, like copper, are significantly reduced in cases of
severe copper deficiency that can occur with the hereditary
diseases associated with disturb&shy;ances in copper meta&shy;bolism:
Menkes kinky hair syndrome and Wilson's disease.  However,
the response of ceruloplasmin to marginal copper deficiency
or short-term copper depletion is variable

In most short-term studies of copper

<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11029965/"
target="right" >Kehoe et&nbsp;al., 2000</a>),</span>

there has been little or no
response by cerulo&shy;plasmin (<a href="#figure24b.2">Figure&nbsp;24b.2</a>).
<p>
Many of the factors that influence serum copper also affect serum
cerulo&shy;plasmin and limit its usefulness as a&nbsp;marker of copper
status, except in cases of severe copper deficiency.
Furthermore, the compli&shy;cations and variations in measuring
cerulo&shy;plasmin and copper in disorders such as Wilson's disease
mean that their value as biomarkers need to be carefully
assessed

However, work is still required to confirm the utility of erythro&shy;cyte
Cu,Zn-SOD activity in studies of the copper status of the
general population.

<h3>&bull;&nbsp;Measuring erythrocyte Cu,Zn-SOD </h3>

There is no standard assay for the measurement of erythro&shy;cyte
Cu,Zn-SOD activity.  Several methods are available; some are
very time consuming, require large samples, neces&shy;sitate the
removal of hemo&shy;globin immediately after sample collection,
and are subject to inter&shy;ferences.
<p>
The assay generally
involves the inhibition of oxidation-reduction reactions
which are catalyzed by the superoxide anion.  The latter may
be gener&shy;ated enzym&shy;atically by, for example, xanthine plus
xanthine oxidase, which, in turn, reduces cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c. The
reduction of cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c is followed spectro&shy;photom&shy;etrically

with small samples.  Commercial kits based on either an
enzyme-linked immuno&shy;sorbent assay or on a&nbsp;spectro&shy;photometric
assay are now available for measuring Cu,Zn-SOD activity in
human serum and urine.
<p>
The analytical coefficient of variation for the erythro&shy;cyte
super&shy;oxide dismutase assay when determined using an
automated method ranges from 1.9&#37; to 11.9&#37;.  The within
subject variation for erythro&shy;cyte Cu,Zn-SOD activity is
generally high

<h3>24b.4	Cytochrome&nbsp;c oxidase</h3>

Cytochrome&nbsp;c oxidase (EC&nbsp;1.9.3.1) is present in
most tissues of living organisms and
is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain.  It
reacts directly with molecular oxygen in cellular
respiration; it catalyzes the electron transfer from
cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c to O<sup>2</sup>.
<p>
Cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c&nbsp;oxi&shy;dase activity in
erythro&shy;cytes, platelets, or mononuclear leukocytes
(lympho&shy;cytes and mon&shy;ocytes) has potential as a&nbsp;sensitive
measure of copper status.  Animal studies have generally
reported reduced tissue cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c&nbsp;oxidase activity as an
early sign of copper deficiency

<h3>&bull;&nbsp;Interpretive criteria</h3>

<a href="#table24b.9">Table&nbsp;24b.9</a> presents mean cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c&nbsp;oxidase activity in
platelets and mono&shy;nuclear&shy; blood cells (lymphocytes and
mono&shy;cytes) by age and sex for adults 20 to &gt;&nbsp;70y. Subjects
were healthy, non&shy;pregnant, and non&shy;smokers and were not
taking any vitamin or mineral sup&shy;plements, or prescribed
medications, with the exception of estrogen.

<h3>&bull;&nbsp;Measurement of cytochrome-c oxidase</h3>

Platelets and mono&shy;nuclear cells have a&nbsp;shorter lifespan (&asymp;10d)
than erythrocytes (&asymp;120d) and therefore activities in
these shorter-lived cell types better reflect the
metabolically active pool of endog&shy;enous copper.  However,
the isolation of such specific cell types is time consuming
and complex, as noted in Section 15.1.3.  Moreover, the
enzyme cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c&nbsp;oxidase is labile, and between subject
variation is large.  Hence, before the test can be used in
community studies, the assay method must be rigorously
standardized.  An assay developed by Prohaska and Wells

Lysyl oxidase (EC&nbsp;1.4.3.13) is

of lysine-derived cross-links.  The latter are required for
the formation of strong, flexible connective tissue

The results of
this initial study suggest that lysyl oxidase activity
declines when dietary copper intake is inadequate,
indicating that the cross-linking of collagen may be
modulated by copper deficiency.  Skin lysyl oxidase could be
used as a&nbsp;biomarker of copper status in young men.  Further
studies are needed to assess whether the test can also be
used in women and older subjects.  Skin biopsies are
invasive procedures, so that the test probably will have
limited use in community-based studies.

Araya and colleagues tested the hypothesis that CCS would not be
affected by inflam&shy;matory processes, unlike cerulo&shy;plasmin, by
measuring CCS mRNA and CCS protein in serum in volunteers
who had inflam&shy;matory responses, as demon&shy;strated by clinical
history and C-reactive protein.  They showed no change in
either CCS protein or mRNA, supporting the idea that CCS
could be used as a&nbsp;copper marker, and not as an indicator of
ceruloplasmin

of rats.  However,
the validity of hair copper concentrations as a&nbsp;biomarker of
copper status in humans is less certain.  In a&nbsp;detailed
human study of therosclerosis patients, hair copper concen&shy;trations did not correlate
with the copper content of heart, muscle, liver, kidney,

Additionally, infants with copper
deficiency, character&shy;ized clinically by neutro&shy;penia and
biochem&shy;ically by concen&shy;trations of serum copper and
cerulo&shy;plasmin below the detection limit, did not have lower
hair copper levels than age and sex-matched controls

Similarly, the copper content of
the hair of children with Menkes kinky hair syndrome is
normal

It appears, therefore, that hair
copper cannot be used as a&nbsp;biomarker of copper status in
humans.

<h3>&bull;&nbsp;Urinary copper concentrations </h3>

Urinary copper
is seldom used as an index of copper status; levels are very
low in healthy subjects
<span class="n">(10&ndash;60&micro;g/d)</span> because copper is
efficiently reabsorbed by the renal tubules.  The main
excretory route for copper is the biliary system.  Urinary
copper concentrations do decrease in persons receiving TPN
copper-deficient solutions

copper.  However, in a&nbsp;13wk experimental
depletion-repletion study in which men were fed three levels
of dietary copper, urinary copper levels were unaffected by
dietary copper levels

Elevated values for erythro&shy;cyte copper have been reported in
patients with the two inherited metabolic disorders
associated with defects in copper metabolism (Wilson's
disease and Menkes syndrome), as well as in children with
Down's syndrome and cystic fibrosis.  Further studies are
needed to ascertain the validity of these measures of copper
status.

Results suggest that changes in both urinary
pyridin&shy;oline and deoxypyridin&shy;oline (biomarkers of bone

copper status in populations that consume diets low in
copper; details of these biomarkers of bone resorption are
given in Section 23.1.5.

Peptidylglycine &alpha;-amidating monooxygenase (PAM)

<h3>&bull;&nbsp;Multiple indices </h3>

Serum copper is frequently used to assess
copper status in both clinical and community studies, but it
is not very sensitive or specific

Increasingly, because of its higher sensitivity and
specificity, the activity of Cu,Zn-SOD in erythro&shy;cytes is
used in combin&shy;ation with serum copper.  In the future, the
activity of cyto&shy;chrome&nbsp;c&nbsp;oxidase in platelets or diamine
oxidase in serum may be used in combination with serum
copper, instead of erythro&shy;cyte Cu,Zn-SOD, if their validity
as bio&shy;markers of copper status in a&nbsp;community setting is
confirmed.
