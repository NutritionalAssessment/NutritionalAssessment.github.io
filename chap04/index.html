&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principles of <br> Nutritional Assessment: <br>Food Composition

</h1>3rd Edition  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; June, 2025 <p></p>


<div class="abstract">
<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

Food composition data are the basis for almost everything in nutrition. 
Food composition tables or databases (FCTs) provide detailed information 
on the content of macronutrients (i.e. protein, fat, carbohydrates and 
dietary fiber), vitamins, minerals, and other components in foods and beverages. 
FCTs are needed to convert quantitative or semi-quantitative dietary 
data into energy and nutrient intakes.
<p></p>
FCTs should be developed at country, or at least regional level, due to 
intrinsic (e.g., variety/breed or cultivar) and extrinsic factors (e.g., 
soil composition, farming conditions and fortification levels) that may 
affect the composition of foods. Published FCTs vary considerably in terms 
of data quality, documentation, food and nutrient coverage, analytical 
methods and accessibility. The ability to find available, accessible and 
good quality food composition data is key to ensure appropriate use for 
decision-making and policies for nutrition. Using inappropriate or poor 
quality FCTs to estimate nutrient intake may lead to inaccurate results 
when assessing nutrient adequacy. In this context, an evaluation of the 
quality of published FCTs is crucial for users to determine suitability 
according to the specific need.
<p></p>
The first part of this chapter discusses the methodologies, uncertainties, 
and challenges in compiling food composition data. In principle, analytical 
data produced by trained analysts using appropriate methods carried out under 
quality assurance procedures are key to generate high-quality FCTs. However, 
food analysis is costly and time consuming, and compromises between making 
use of existing data and augmenting a database with new chemical analyses often 
need to be made. In particular, for recipes, calculation procedures represent 
a cost-effective alternative to producing estimates of the nutrient content for 
composite dishes based on ingredients. 
<p></p>
Food composition data may also be compiled from analytical values from the 
literature or borrowed from other published FCTs. When selecting food 
composition values for use from other sources it is critical to recognize 
potential sources of error and understand the quality of the data, as these 
factors may impact the use of the data, for example for nutrient intake calculations. 
<p></p>
The second part of the chapter focuses on using food composition data to assess 
nutrient intakes. Food matching (i.e. all steps performed to link foods from 
different datasets to food composition data) is a critical step to obtain 
high quality estimations of nutrient intake. When performing food matching, the
highest quality match should be selected by identifying the closest food available, 
with a complete nutrient profile, in the most appropriate FCT.
<p></p>
Finally, this chapter provides key resources that can be accessed and used to 
support readers in compiling and using food composition data.

<h3> 4a.0  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction. </h3>

Food composition tables or databases (FCTs) are needed 
to convert quantitative or semiquantitative dietary data 
into energy and nutrient intakes. FCTs provide detailed 
information on the content of macronutrients (i.e. 
protein, fat, carbohydrates and dietary fiber), vitamins, 
minerals, and other components in foods and beverages. 
Nutrient values are usually expressed per 100g edible 
portion on fresh weight basis (per 100g EP) for all foods 
(including liquids), although sometimes additional 
information for common household measures or portion 
sizes is provided. When selecting food composition values 
for use it is critical to recognize potential sources of error 
and understand the quality of the data, as these factors 
may affect nutrient intake calculations. Uncertainties may 
arise from random variability in nutrient content or from 
systematic errors, which can lead to under&#8209; or 
overestimation of nutrient intakes. 
<p></p>
FCT values reflect total nutrient content, not bioavailable 
amounts, as bioavailability data for most nutrients remain 
unquantified. Thus, calculated nutrient intakes represent 
the maximum potential availability. More information on 
bioavailability is available on Chapter&nbsp;4b  Assessment of 
bioavailable nutrient intakes.
<p></p>
This chapter discusses the methodologies, uncertainties, 
and challenges in compiling and using food composition 
data to assess nutrient intakes.

provide a detailed description of 
the development of a research food composition database 
for use in rural Kenya.
<p></p>
Four methods are used to compile food composition data; 
these are discussed briefly below. The same methods can 
also be used to augment or update existing FCTs with 
values for local food items.

<a id="sec4a.1.1"></a>
<h3> 4a.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;Direct chemical analysis </h3>

Analytical data produced by trained analysts using 
appropriate methods carried out under quality assurance 
procedures are key to generate high-quality FCTs 

<span data-tippy-content="Greenfield, H., & Southgate, D. A. T. (2003). 
Food Composition Data: Production, Management and Use 2nd edition. 
Food and Agriculture Organization of The United Nation, 2, 295.">
	(<a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/handle/20.500.14283/y4705e"
	target="right" >Greenfield & Southgate, 2003</a>). </span>

However, food analysis is 
costly and time consuming, so a balance must be drawn 
between making use of existing data and augmenting a 
database with new chemical analyses. Priority should be 
given to analyzing those foods that meet the following 
criteria: 

<ul>
<li>The food makes up a significant component of the 
local diet;
<li>The food contributes significantly to the intake of 
the dietary component of interest;
<li>The data for the component of interest in the food, 
or the food as eaten, is inadequate or nonexistent.
</li></ul>

Food consumption survey data on portion size and 
frequency of consumption should be used to identify  key 
foods  that contribute significantly to the overall intake of 
the nutrient of interest 

<span data-tippy-content="Haytowitz, D. B., Pehrsson, P. R., & 
Holden, J. M. (2002). The identification of key foods for food composition 
research. Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, 15(2), 183–194. ">
	(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/jfca.2001.1046"
	target="right" >Haytowitz et al., 2002</a>). </span> 

The average daily frequency of consumption of the key foods 
can then be multiplied by the average portion size 
consumed by the sex and age-group of interest. Such a 
procedure takes into account food items that are 
consumed frequently but in small amounts. Since the 
development of the key foods approach in the mid-1980s 
by the United States Nutrient Data Laboratory, many 
countries have adopted this method with modifications 
for setting priorities related to food selection and nutrient 
update

<p></p>
Absence of data may necessitate direct chemical analysis 
of foods to augment a FCT, particularly if local differences 
in food processing, preparation or cooking affect the 
concentration of the component of interest. For example, 
milling, germination, fermentation, and soaking may all 
reduce the phytic acid content of plant foods, making it 
essential to analyze the phytic acid values of any local 
plant-based foods prepared and processed in these ways

<p></p>
Data derived from direct chemical analyses are especially 
necessary for elements such as iron, selenium, iodine, and 
zinc in plant-based staples because their content often 
depends on the levels in local soils or agronomy practices 

(<a href="#sec4a.2.6">Section &nbsp;4a.2.6)</a>. 

For example, Gibson et al.

<span data-tippy-content="Gibson, R. S., Wawer, A. A., Fairweather-Tait, S. J., 
Hurst, R., Young, S. D., Broadley, M. R., Chilimba, A. D. C., Ander, E. L., 
Watts, M. J., Kalimbira, A., Bailey, K. B., & Siyame, E. W. P. (2015). 
Dietary iron intakes based on food composition data may underestimate the 
contribution of potentially exchangeable contaminant 
iron from soil. Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, 40, 19–23. ">
	(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2014.11.016"
	target="right" >2015</a>)</span>
 
highlight the importance of generating analytical data for 
foods grown where extraneous contaminant iron from soil 
is likely. In such circumstances, the iron intake may be 
underestimated if calculated on the basis of food 
composition data for foods grown in uncontaminated 
soils.
<p></p>
Once the foods have been selected for analysis, a protocol 
must be established to ensure that a representative 
sample of each food item is collected; details of the 
sampling protocols required are given in
(<a href="#sec4a.2.1">Section &nbsp;4a.2.1</a>).  After collection, food 
samples should be prepared and analyzed using 
appropriate methods.  
<p></p>
The analytical methods chosen must be accurate, precise, 
and feasible. It is preferable to separately analyze each of 
the food samples per food type collected: this provides 
information on the variability within one food type. In 
practice, a single composite is often analyzed from the 
multiple samples to reduce the analytical costs 

<span data-tippy-content="Murphy, S. P., Weinberg-Andersson, S. W., 
Neumann, C., Mulligan, K., & Calloway, D. H. (1991).

	(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0889-1575(91)90044-7"
	target="right" >Murphy et al., 1991</a>). </span>

In some cases, the single composite can be 
made up of specific proportions of different cultivars or 
brands to obtain a single generic value for the database. 
Details of each of the steps required to generate analyzed 
food composition values are outlined by Greenfield and 
Southgate

<a id="sec4a.1.2"></a>
<h3> 4a.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Using food composition data from other sources </h3>

Food composition data may also be compiled from 
analytical values from (un)published literature or 
borrowed from other published FCTs.
<p></p>
Analytical values are often drawn from several sources 
including the food industry, published and unpublished 
research or laboratory reports, contract research, and 
government research laboratories. However, it is 
important to consider that analytical values from different 
sources may vary in quality.
<p></p>
To assess the reliability of existing analytical data, rating 
systems have been developed using various quality 
criteria including: 

<ol type="i">
<li> food description, 
<li> component identification, 
<li> number of samples on which values are based, 
<li> analytical method used, 
<li> sample handling, 
<li> sampling protocol, and 
<li> analytical quality control. 
</li></ol>

Each quality criterion is subdivided into further categories 
and structured into questions which allow assigning 
numeric scores based on  yes,  no  or  not applicable  
answers. Depending on the quality system the number of 
categories and subdivisions may vary, but all criteria 
should be considered when selecting food composition 
values from existing analytical data. Differences between 
existing quality evaluation systems exist

	target="right" >Salvini et al., 2009</a>). </span> 

For example, the quality evaluation system

<p></p>
A database manager compiling new information may have 
analytical data for a number of different samples of the 
same food, or data from several sources. In such cases, a 
single  representative  value for each component of 
interest must be calculated for the food and the 
procedure fully documented. When multiple 
measurements of the same food item from different 
samples or sources are available, the mean or median 
value is ideally weighted based on sample size. 
<p></p>
Borrowing data from FCTs of other countries is often the 
approach used where local data are not available. These 
data need to be scrutinized to ensure that they match 
foods consumed locally, considering for example, 
fortification and cooking practices, color of fruit and 
vegetables, etc. Adapting data from another country can 
be challenging and there will always be uncertainty

<h3> 4a.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;Estimating missing food composition values </h3>

Ideally, FCTs should contain values for each nutrient for 
every type of food. However, values are often missing for 
some nutrients. It is not always clear whether these 
missing values arise because no analytical data are 
available or because the nutrient content for a particular 
food is very small. Database compilers should clearly 
distinguish between these, and values that are truly zero 
(see more details in  
<a href="#sec4a.3">Section &nbsp;4a.3)</a>.
The term "missing" should be assigned 
only when analytical data are not available and yet there 
is a high level of confidence that some amount of the 
component is present in the given food. The term "trace" 
should be applied when the component is present at 
levels below the measurement accuracy of the analytical 
method. Greenfield & Southgate

	target="right" >2003</a>) </span> 

suggested some 
limits to declare different components as "trace", but it is 
important to note that these depend on the analytical 
method used.  "Zero" should be used when the 
component is not present in any detectable amount. In 
some cases, a zero value is assigned based on a known 
biological relationship. For example, vitamin&nbsp;B12 does not 
occur in most plant products

<p></p>
Before using any FCT for calculating nutrient intakes, all 
missing and  trace  values in the database must be 
replaced with calculated or imputed numerical values for 
the components of interest. Several procedures and 
sources can be used for imputing values (Box 4a.1). The 
process is important because missing values may be 
treated as zero when nutrient intakes are calculated, 
leading to an underestimation. Further details are given in 
Murphy et al.

When selecting a similar food for estimating nutrient 
values, several factors must be considered, and the choice 
depends on the nutrient of interest. These factors may 
include color, plant maturity, processing or preparation, 
growing conditions, enrichment, fortification or use of 
other additives, or cut of meat. As an example, the color 
of the vegetable is particularly important when imputing 
the carotenoid or pro-vitamin&nbsp;A content of a vegetable

<h3> 4a.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;Calculating nutrient values of recipes </h3>

Direct analysis is the preferred method to determine the 
nutrient content of foods. However, recipe calculation 
procedures represent a cost-effective alternative to 
produce estimates of the nutrient content for composite 
dishes based on ingredients. Differences between 
calculated and analyzed values for recipes exist, especially 
for micronutrients, due to several reasons such as 
differences in the nutrient content of ingredients in FCTs 
and ingredients actually used in recipe preparation, as 
well as duration of cooking and temperature used during 
the recipe preparation

On the other hand, the impact of these 
discrepancies can be questioned when compared to the 
intra and interindividual variations in the types and 
amounts of ingredients or even on the cooking methods 
used to prepare recipes, which also result in a great 
source of variability

Recipes can range from simple combinations of 
ingredients to more complex preparations involving 
cooking, which require adjustments using yield and 
nutrient retention factors. Examples of simple 
combinations include a raw fruit salad, and the 
preparation of tomato soup from condensed soup and 
whole milk. In these cases, nutrient values for the 
ingredients  as consumed  are summed and then 
corrected for 100g of the final food

<span data-tippy-content="Rand, W. M., Pennington, J. A. T., Murphy, S. P., & 
Klensin, J. C. (1991). Compiling data for

	target="right" >Rand et al., 1991</a>).</span>

<p></p>
In contrast, calculating the nutrient content of a cooked 
multi-ingredient recipe requires accounting for changes in 
both weight and nutrient content. In these cases, 
appropriate calculations require complete recipe 
information, including the weight of each ingredient and 
the final weight of the cooked recipe. Yield factors must 
be applied to adjust for changes in water and/or fat during 
cooking, while nutrient retention factors should be 
applied to estimate nutrient losses. Given these 
considerations, it is important to highlight that simply 
summing the nutrient values of raw ingredients is not 
appropriate for cooked multi-ingredient recipes.
<p></p>
Several recipe calculation methods exist, but the mixed 
method, whereby nutrient retention factors are 
applied at the ingredient level and the weight yield factor 
is applied at recipe level, is recommended to calculate the 
composition of multi-ingredient recipes

In practice, different recipe 
calculation methods can be considered for other 
purposes. For example, the ingredient method can be 
used when there is the need to estimate the nutrient 
contribution of individual ingredients from multi-
ingredient recipes

<p></p>
Several stages are used to calculate the nutrient content 
of recipes using the mixed method. These are 

<ol type="i">
<li>selection of the recipe and naming,</li>
<li>collection of complete recipe 
information, including list of ingredients and respective weight in grams of the edible portion,</li>
<li>collection of data for the complete nutrient profile of each ingredient,</li>
<li>selection of calculation method and nutrient retention factors,</li>
<li>adjustment of the nutrient content of each 
ingredient for the effects of preparation (appropriate 
nutrient retention factors), </li>
<li>summation of ingredient composition, </li>
<li>final water/fat adjustments, and </li>
<li>adjustments to express the recipe composition per 100g of final recipe.
</li></ol>

Detailed instructions and examples on 
these calculations can be seen in lesson "5.2 Recipe 
calculation" in the FAO/INFOODS e-Learning Course on 
Food Composition Data

<p></p>
The recipes selected for these calculations should reflect 
the food as prepared by the population or subgroup of 
interest and should take into account any ethnic or 
regional variations. Sources include regional cookery 
books, average recipes constructed from information 
recorded during dietary assessment using food records or 
24-hour recalls, and recipes obtained directly from 
respondents. In some countries, standard recipes may not 
be available for local dishes. In such cases, recipe data can 
be constructed by observing and recording local cooking 
practices that use locally available ingredients

Assembling detailed information for each 
recipe is key for determining the quality of calculated 
values. An example of the details to be collected is 
available in the  Kenyan Food Recipes, a recipe book of 
common mixed dishes with nutrient values

including detailed information of 
commonly consumed dishes across Kenyan communities.
<p></p>
It is emphasized that the nutrient contents of calculated 
recipes are estimates. Although it is preferable to use 
yield and retention factors based on habitual cooking 
methods for the region of interest, in practice the 
calculations often rely on yield and nutrient retention 
factors taken from published tables. The latter may not be 
a true reflection of the actual factors, as these vary with 
duration and temperature of cooking, type of cooking, 
equipment used, and surface area of food contact 
exposure etc.

<h3> 4a.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sources of error in food composition values</h3>

The quality of food composition values in FCTs is often 
variable and subject to random and/or systematic errors. 
Such errors impact the calculation of nutrient intakes and 
generate additional uncertainty. Numerous standards, 
guidelines and tools have been developed by expert 
authorities such as FAO, INFOODS and EuroFIR ASIBL in an 
effort to minimize the sources of error and facilitate 
international data exchange

These standards and guidelines have been 
adopted by several compilers of FCTs.
<p></p>
The sources of error are considered in detail below and 
summarized in Box 4a.2. For some standard components 
the most critical point is the choice of the analytical 
method, while for other components levels are affected 
by inconsistent definitions or expressions, or because they 
are calculated in a non-systematic way. For some 
components all sources of error may apply. The factors 
outlined in the sections below make the evaluation, 
selection and comparison of data from different data 
sources very challenging.

<h3> 4a.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;Inadequate sampling protocols </h3>

A sampling protocol is a specific procedure for the 
selection, collection, preservation and preparation of food 
samples for analysis. The main objectives of a sampling 
protocol are to ensure that collected samples are 
representative of the foods consumed and avoid changes 
in composition between collection and analysis 

<span data-tippy-content="Greenfield, H., & Southgate, D. A. T. (2003). 
Food Composition Data: Production, Management and Use 2nd edition. 
Food and Agriculture Organization of The United Nation, 2, 295.">
	(<a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/handle/20.500.14283/y4705e"
	target="right" >Greenfield & Southgate, 2003</a>). </span>

Furthermore, the use of a 
standard description of samples and analytical results by 
using standardized data elements can enhance overall 
data quality 

<span data-tippy-content="European Food Safety Authority. (2013). 
Standard Sample Description ver. 2.0. EFSA Journal, 11(10). ">
	(<a href="https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2013.3424"
	target="right" >European Food Safety Authority, 2013</a>). </span> 

<p></p>
When nutrient values for specific foods are required for a 
FCT, sampling protocols must be designed to ensure the 
collection of representative food samples for analysis. 
Since foods are biological materials, some natural 
variation in their nutrient content is expected and should 
not be automatically interpreted as analytical errors. Thus, 
for representative results, the sampling protocol should 
consider factors such as seasonal and regional differences 
in the composition of the food, genetic variation, stage of 
ripeness, handling and storage procedures, variations 
resulting from the effects of fertilizer application, pest 
control, method of food preparation, processing, and 
production practices

	target="right" >Greenfield & Southgate, 2003</a>). </span>

In this way, random errors resulting from true variability in 
the nutrient composition of individual food items can be 
reduced. When standardized sampling protocols are not 
used, results may not reflect the average nutrient content 
of a food on a year-round nationwide basis. Systematic 
errors may occur in some food composition data, 
particularly with fortified, processed, and manufactured 
foods. In foods fortified with folic acid, for example, wide 
variations in folic acid content tends to occur, especially in 
the case of voluntary fortification. As a result, country and 
brand specific nutrient composition data should be used 
for these food items to prevent errors in nutrient intake 
estimations

Different sampling methods exist but stratified sampling 
protocols are preferred and will generally be the method 
of choice

The best approach to estimate the 
number of food samples required is by using a statistical 
formula to ensure that the results are representative of 
the food item under consideration and have an acceptable 
level of precision. In practice, sufficient data required to 
perform these statistical calculations (i.e., mean, standard 
deviation, and variability of the nutrient content in the 
food) are rarely available. Instead, ten samples per food 
type are often collected. This number is thought to be 
large enough to reflect the variability in composition of 
most foods. As a general rule, the higher the variability in 
the nutrient content for the sampled food, the higher the 
number of samples that should be collected

For many food components, several analytical methods 
are available; however, they are not always appropriate or 
compatible because they may generate significantly 
different results. For example, dietary fiber is a 
heterogeneous group of components for which several 
definitions and analytical methods exist. Distinct analytical 
methods capture different fiber fractions causing 
confusion among analysts and users of food composition 
data

Another example is the analysis of total vitamin&nbsp;C in foodstuffs, 
which should measure both active forms of vitamin&nbsp;C (i.e., 
L-ascorbic acid and L-dehydroascorbic acid). Three types 
of methods are used to measure the combined activity of 
both its active forms (total vitamin&nbsp;C): colorimetry, 
fluorimetry, and HPLC methods, which give values that are 
broadly comparable. However, if the method used to 
analyze vitamin&nbsp;C is the titrimetric method, only the 
reduced form of the vitamin&nbsp;(L-ascorbic acid) will be 
captured and may thus underestimate the vitamin&nbsp;C 
content, especially for processed foods

Thus, procedures for 
quality control should be included in the analytical 
routine. For example, the use of reference materials is of 
great importance to control the accuracy of the results. 
This can be achieved by the analysis of standard amounts 
of the analyzed component, preferably from standard 
reference materials (SRMs) or certified reference 
materials (CRMs), in parallel to the analysis of the food 
sample of interest.
<p></p>
Given the importance of analytical procedures for food 
composition data, some rating criteria to assess the 
quality of analytical methods were developed and are also 
briefly described in
<a href="#sec4a.1.2">Section&nbsp;4a.1.2</a>.

<a id="sec4a.2.3"></a>
<h3> 4a.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;Uncertainties associated with energy and protein values</h3>

Despite a recommendation by INFOODS and other expert 
authorities to standardize units of expression for all 
nutrients to facilitate the international exchange of food 
composition data, this has not yet been accomplished. 
The modes of expression differ, particularly for the two 
components (energy and protein) which are derived from 
other analytic measurements. 
<p></p>
<b>Energy</b> values in FCTs are generally calculated indirectly 
from the amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrate, and 
alcohol in foods, using various energy conversion factors. 
This approach is followed because the standard method 
for measuring the energy content of a food (i.e., bomb 
calorimetry) does not reflect the energy actually available 
to the body. The energy conversion factors used are all 
corrected to consider the losses of energy occurring in 
digestion and absorption and through incomplete 
oxidation. Consequently, the calculated energy values 
represent the available, or metabolizable, energy content 
of foods

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2003). Food energy – methods of analysis 
and conversion factors. FAO Food and Nutrition 
Paper 77. Report of a technical workshop Rome, 3-6 December 2002. ">
	(<a href="https://www.fao.org/4/Y5022E/Y5022E00.htm"
	target="right" >FAO, 2003</a>). </span> 

However, conversion factors for 
calculating the energy content of foods are not 
standardized among FCTs, leading to variations in the 
documented energy content of similar foods. Different
conversion factors and component definitions are 
adopted among FCTs resulting in limited comparability 
within declared values. Moreover, other components may 
be considered in the energy calculation such as polyols 
and organic acids, which will also affect the results when 
comparing the energy data provided by databases of 
different countries 

<span data-tippy-content="Charrondiere, U. R., Chevassus-Agnes, S., 
Marroni, S., & Burlingame, B. (2004). Impact of different

Therefore, when using data from several 
sources it is recommended to recalculate the energy 
content to obtain standardized values. FAO and INFOODS 
recommend calculating  energy from the energy-yielding 
macronutrients using the following energy conversion 
factors: 
17kJ/g (4kcal/g) for protein, 
37kJ/g (9kcal/g) for fat, 
17kJ/g (4kcal/g) for available/total carbohydrate, 
8kJ/g (2kcal/g) for dietary fiber (but if only total 
carbohydrate is available, no energy is attributed to the 
dietary fiber value) and 
29kJ/g (7kcal/g) for alcohol

<b>Protein</b> values of foods are conventionally calculated from 
the total nitrogen content measured using Kjeldahl-type 
methods. A conversion factor to calculate crude protein is 
then applied. In some FCTs, the factor of 6.25 is used 
indiscriminately to convert total nitrogen into protein, 
based on the assumption that all proteins, regardless of 
their source, contain 16% nitrogen. Many countries, 
however, apply specific nitrogen conversion factors 
recommended by the FAO/WHO Committee on Energy 
and Protein Requirements

<h3> 4a.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;Inconsistencies in terminology or definition for components </h3>

vitamin&nbsp;C, vitamin&nbsp;D, vitamin&nbsp;E, vitamin&nbsp;K, niacin, and 
folate. Such inconsistencies arise, in part, because most of 
these components have multiple definitions or distinct 
analytical methods that result in significantly different 
values.
<p></p> 
For these components, in addition to the common 
component name (e.g. folate), supplementary information 
on the analytical and calculation method, definition and 
expression should also be considered for precise 
identification before use.
<p></p>


<b>Carbohydrate</b>, for example, may be expressed in FCTs using five different 
definitions (Figure 4a.1). They may be categorized as either  available or 
total carbohydrates.  Available carbohydrates include sugars (e.g. glucose, fructose, 
sucrose, lactose), oligosaccharides, starch and glycogen. Total carbohydrates, 
on the other hand, also include dietary fiber. Consequently, the value for 
total carbohydrates is higher than that for available carbohydrates in 
foods containing dietary fiber.

Carbohydrate values can be derived in two different ways: either 
estimated by "difference" or determined through direct analysis. 
Total carbohydrates can be calculated by difference as 
100 minus the sum of grams per 100 grams of water, protein, fat, alcohol, 
and ash. Available carbohydrates can be calculated by difference as 
100 minus the sum of grams per 100 grams of water, protein, fat, 
alcohol, ash and dietary fiber. When total or available carbohydrates are 
calculated by difference, they include the analytical errors of all 
contributing nutrients, so direct analysis is always preferred. 
Expression by difference is only acceptable when analytical data for the 
components of the carbohydrates cannot be generated. 
<p></p>
Total carbohydrates may be directly measured by quantifying the 
individual components and summing them to give a total. 
For available carbohydrates, there are two definitions 
that refer to analyzed
values, each of which uses a different mode of expression. 
For example, the value for available carbohydrates 
by weight refers to the sum of analytical values (anhydrous form) 
of sugars, starch, and glycogen, and is the most recommended 
carbohydrate definition. In contrast, the value for 
available carbohydrates expressed as monosaccharide equivalents is the 
sum of analytical values (hydrous form) of sugars, starch, and 
glycogen, and is higher than available carbohydrates by weight 
because it accounts for the residual water from the 
hydrolysis around each monosaccharide.

<p></p>
<b>Vitamin&nbsp;A</b> values in FCTs should include both retinol 
(often termed preformed vitamin&nbsp;A) and the carotenoids 
demonstrated to exhibit vitamin&nbsp;A activity (termed 
provitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids). Of the latter, &beta;&#8209;carotene is the 
most important, but &alpha;&#8209;carotene and &beta;&#8209;cryptoxanthin are 
also considered as main carotenes with vitamin&nbsp;A activity 
and thus should be included in the total vitamin&nbsp;A 
calculation. 
<p></p>
Different vitamin&nbsp;A definitions may be used to report total 
vitamin&nbsp;A in FCTs. Retinol Equivalents (RE) and/or Retinol 
Activity Equivalents (RAE) are most commonly used. 
The RE definition was introduced by the FAO/WHO 
Committee on Dietary Allowances

<span data-tippy-content="National Research Council. Committee on Dietary
Allowances. (1989). Recommended Dietary Allowances (10th rev.). ">
	(<a href=" https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/1349/recommended-dietary-allowances-10th-edition"
	target="right" >1989</a>). </span>

However, the United States Food and 
Nutrition Board proposed the RAE definition considering 
that the vitamin&nbsp;A activity of provitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids is 
half of what was previously adopted

<span data-tippy-content="Institute of Medicine (IOM). (2001).

boron, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese,

	(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222310/"
	target="right" >IOM, 2001</a>). </span>

Therefore, the amount of vitamin&nbsp;A activity 
derived from provitamin&nbsp;A carotenoids using the 
conversion factors to calculate RAE is half of the amount 
derived using the factors to calculate RE. The lack of 
harmonization in the definition adopted to express 
vitamin&nbsp;A in FCTs represent a challenge to produce, report 
and interpret vitamin&nbsp;A statistics. Depending on the 
vitamin&nbsp;A definition and estimated average requirements 
adopted, the level of adequacy may change dramatically 
for some countries. Therefore, vitamin&nbsp;A statistics and 
indicators must be based on standardized vitamin&nbsp;A values 
i.e., using the same source of requirements, and the 
criteria adopted should be clearly documented to avoid 
inaccurate comparisons

<p></p>
<b>Vitamin&nbsp;C</b> activity should be defined as the sum of 
L-ascorbic acid (reduced form) and the L-dehydroascorbic 
acid content of a food, as both forms are biologically 
active 
(<a href="#sec4a.2.2">Section&nbsp;4a.2.2)</a>.
Some FCTs do not comply with this 
definition, therefore details should be verified in the 
documentation before data use. 

<p></p>

<b>Vitamin&nbsp;D</b> is normally determined by measuring the sum of cholecalciferol (vitamin&nbsp;D3) 
and ergocalciferol (vitamin&nbsp;D2). Of these, vitamin&nbsp;D2 occurs naturally in fungi, 
including yeast, but vitamin&nbsp;D3 occurs only in animal products. Foods can be fortified 
with cholecalciferol or with synthetic ergocalciferol; both have the same vitamin&nbsp;D activity. 
Both components of vitamin&nbsp;D should be analyzed in fortified foods, and the 
total should be included in the FCT. Small amounts of 25-hydroxy-vitamin&nbsp;D are present 
in some animal foods and its activity is believed to be greater than that of the other 
two active forms even though there is a lack of consensus on calculating total 
vitamin&nbsp;D activity from its components. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 
has recommended a conversion factor of 2.5 for calcidiol monohydrate (a form 
of 25-hydroxy-vitamin&nbsp;D) when calculating vitamin&nbsp;D activity 
for labeling purposes

less frequently considered in national FCTs,

<b>Vitamin E</b>  is a term that refers to eight different analogues, namely 
tocopherols (&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, and &delta;) and four tocotrienols that have varying levels

Recent releases of the USDA food composition databases and those of

their &alpha;&#8209;tocopherol content (mg/100g). The content of other chemical 
forms of tocopherol naturally occurring but with less biological activity are 
ignored and no longer taken into account when assessing dietary intakes and 
setting vitamin&nbsp;E requirements.

<b>Niacin</b> activity in foods is best expressed in terms of 
milligrams of niacin equivalents that include the 
contribution of niacin from tryptophan, as well as 
preformed niacin. Niacin equivalents (NE) (mg) are calculated as: 
\[\small \mbox {niacin (mg) &plus; (tryptophan (mg)/60.0)}\]
However, it is important to note that not all FCTs provide 
values for niacin equivalents but list data for preformed 
niacin only.

evaluated folate data of selected 
European and international databases and described the 
lack of comparability between and within folate values. 
Summarized, the discrepancies result from the various 
existing folate entities and their expression, and from the 
choice of analytical method. The terminology among FCTs 
for folate varies, for example in some of them the term 
"folic acid"  is used ambiguously as a synonym for total 
folate. In some databases, total folate is measured by 
microbiological assay, whereas in others chromatographic 
quantification (e.g., HPLC) is applied, which measures 
folate as monoglutamates. Ideally, HPLC-derived data are 
given either as concentration of individual folates or as a 
"sum of individual folates, expressed as folic acid" 
specifying which forms are included. Furthermore, in 
recognition of the lower bioavailability of naturally 
occurring dietary folates compared to synthetic folate, the 
IOM

proposes the expression of dietary folate 
equivalents (DFEs). This definition takes into account the 
differences in the bioavailability of naturally occurring 
folates (food folate) and folic acid from fortified foods. 
Thus, for dietary purposes, if we have a mixture of food 
folate and folic acid, DFEs are calculated as &micro;g of food 
folate plus &micro;g of folic acid &times; 1.7

There is obviously an urgent need to harmonize the 
terminology used for these "problematic" components. All 
FCTs should include definitions of the terminology used 
and the conversion factors, where appropriate, as 
specified by Greenfield & Southgate

To assist compilers and users of FCTs in overcoming the 
challenges related to component identification, INFOODS 
developed the INFOODS component identifiers, which are 
also known as INFOODS tagnames. Tagnames are like 
codes or abbreviations according to a specific naming 
system that allows to clearly define components and to 
facilitate data interchange. Therefore, the primary use for 
food component tagnames is to determine whether the 
associated values can be compared or combined

stress that quite a diverse range of food components is 
linked to the loose terms "carbohydrates" and "dietary 
fiber", and illustrate how standardized values based on 
the carbohydrate description can result in significant 
differences when comparing different FCTs. 
<p></p>
Similar to INFOODS, EuroFIR AISBL uses a system which 
allows to unambiguously identify components and is 
mainly used in European FCTs. While the INFOODS 
tagnames aim to combine comparable values analyzed by 
different methods under one tagname, the EuroFIR 
system is used to identify the component or 
physico-chemical property with additional information recorded 
separately following a hierarchy. Note that both systems 
are based on similar principles but are not directly 
interchangeable.

Composition Data includes a section dedicated to food 
components, which explains the importance of an

<h3> 4a.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;Insufficiently detailed or incorrect description 
of individual foods </h3>

A precise, detailed food description is of great importance 
for food composition data quality and use. Poor food 
descriptions make it difficult for users to match a food 
consumed with the appropriate item in the FCT. Such 
difficulties can produce biases in the calculation of 
nutrient intakes. For instance, if an item is described in a 
FCT only as "milk", it would be extremely difficult to use 
the data, even if the data were generated by high-quality 
analytical methods. The milk composition will depend on 
the type of animal and processing method, fat content, 
form (liquid or powder) and fortification practices, which 
can greatly impact the nutrient content.
<p></p>
A complete food description should include the food 
name and synonyms, the scientific taxonomic name if 
applicable, and descriptors related to the part, color, 
maturity stage, variety or breed, origin (e.g., type of 
animal, agricultural/husbandry practices or harvest 
season), fortification and cooking or preservation method. 
A summary of descriptors, also called facets, for use in 
food nomenclature for identifying foods is summarized by 
Greenfield and Southgate

The INFOODS nomenclature system is designed as a broad and 
multifaceted tool describing elements exhaustively 
through an open-ended mechanism. While it is considered 
a user-friendly and culture-independent system, no 
further developments or updates have been published 
since its first release. In parallel, LanguaL<sup>TM</sup> is a 
multilingual system using faceted descriptors. The food 
item is described using a set of standardized and 
controlled terms chosen from facets to detail relevant 
aspects of the food. This system is used mainly by 
European FCTs but other countries such as USA, Canada, 
New Zealand and Australia, have also indexed LanguaL<sup>TM</sup> 
to their national FCTs. FoodEx2

with the aim of facilitating food safety exposure risk 
assessments. The system can be used to harmonize the 
description of foods in different types of data, including 
dietary intake data, chemical occurrence data and food 
composition data, among others. FoodEx2 uses main 
codes (base terms) that can be further described with 
facets, offering great flexibility to describe and classify 
foods according to the level of detail provided in the 
original data. The system is mainly used by European 
countries and EFSA for exposure risk assessments, but its 
use by other countries has increased since 2016, when FAO 
and WHO adopted FoodEx2 to harmonize food 
composition data and dietary intake data available in the

<h3> 4a.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;Genetic, environmental, preparation, and processing factors </h3>

Even if all the sources of error in food composition data 
discussed earlier are eliminated, discrepancies in nutrient 
composition values for similar food items will still occur 
among different sets of food composition data. These 
variations may arise from factors regarding the entire life 
span of a food, from the environment, the choice of the 
agricultural type of production and the foods  genetics, 
through to the processing and storage techniques applied, 
and differences resulting from methods of preparation 
used. Some of these factors are described more in detail 
below.
<p></p>
The soil composition and climatic conditions may result in 
significant variation in the nutrient content of foods. In 
some areas for instance, the selenium content of foods is 
lower than elsewhere as a result of lower selenium levels 
in the soil. The iodine and zinc content of foods is also 
very variable across countries because of differences in 
the content and availability of iodine and zinc in the soil, 
as well as in the types and amounts of fertilizers used

	target="right" >Sunanda et al., 1995</a>). </span>

In contrast, the level of carotenoids 
in foods is influenced by varietal differences, variable 
growth and harvesting, and different postharvest handling 
and processing methods

<p></p>
It is well recognized that genetics and biodiversity, i.e., the 
diversity within species, between species and of 
ecosystems, have a substantial impact on nutrient levels of 
foods. Selected varieties or cultivars are sometimes listed 
in national/regional FCTs, as well as wild or underutilized 
species that may contribute to dietary intake. However, 
there is still a need to study these varietal differences, and 
some tools have been developed in the past to strengthen 
the respective knowledge base. For example, a global 
repository of compositional data specific for biodiversity 
has been developed by FAO/INFOODS 

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2017b). FAO/INFOODS Food composition 
database for biodiversity, version 4.0 (BioFoodComp4.0). ">
	(<a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/handle/20.500.14283/i7364en"
	target="right" >FAO, 2017b</a>), </span>

while also country-specific attempts have been made to 
strengthen the importance for generating and compiling 
data of such foods

<span data-tippy-content="Grande F, Giuntini EB, Coelho KS, Purgatto E, 
Franco BDGM, Lajolo FM, Menezes EW. Biodiversity food dataset:

	target="right" >Grande et al., 2020</a>). </span>

<p></p>
Differences across countries may also arise from 
variations in the fortification or enrichment of selected 
foods with specific nutrients. Over 140 countries 
worldwide have regulations or guidance for large-scale 
food-fortification, most of these being mandatory. In the 
last two decades, fortification programs became especially 
popular in low&#8209; and middle-income countries (LMICs), and 
some approaches confirmed a positive impact on 
nutritional outcomes by fortifying foods with vitamin&nbsp;A, 
iodine and iron in these countries

<span data-tippy-content="Olson R, Gavin-Smith B, Ferraboschi C, Kraemer K.

More details on the implementation of country-specific 
regulations can be found on the website of the Global 
Fortification Data Exchange

<p></p>
The content of certain water-soluble and heat-labile 
nutrients in foods may also change during food 
preparation and processing. For example, the content of 
vitamin&nbsp;C and thiamin in many foods varies with the 
cooking time and temperature used, the amount of water 
added, and the pH in which the food is prepared

<span data-tippy-content="Lešková, E., Kubíková, J., Kováčiková, E., 
Košická, M., Porubská, J., & Holčíková, K. (2006). Vitamin losses: 
Retention during heat treatment and continual changes expressed by mathematical 
models. Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, 19(4), 252–276. ">
	(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2005.04.014"
	target="right" >Lešková et al., 2006</a>). </span> 

Substantial losses of folate, mainly from 
leaching from the food into the cooking water rather than 
from chemical degradation, also occur during cooking and 
thermal processing of certain foods; folate retention is 
greater with steaming rather than boiling. In addition, the 
inherent variability of the folate content of foods also 
appears large.
<p></p>
Nutrient losses during cooking may result in large 
discrepancies between the actual thiamin, vitamin&nbsp;C, and 
folate content when compared with the calculated values, 
especially when food composition data of raw ingredients 
are used to compute nutrient values for cooked dishes. 
Data on nutrient retention during food preparation are 
limited, making it difficult to accurately estimate the 
nutrient values of a cooked composite dish 

<span data-tippy-content="Hoover LW, Pelican S. (1984). Nutrient data bases:
considerations for educators. Journal of Nutrition Education 16: 58–62.">
	(<a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ301929"
	target="right" >Hoover and Pelican, 1984</a>) </span> 

as noted in 
<a href="#sec4a.1.4">Section&nbsp;4a.1.4</a>
<p></p>
The variations in nutrient composition values arising from 
the factors discussed above emphasize the importance of 
using nutrient values appropriate for the country in which 
the food is prepared and consumed. The foods should be 
adequately described
(<a href="#sec4a.2.5">Section &nbsp;4a.2.5)</a> and the food 
components ranked by quality codes that take into 
account the analytical method used, sample handling, and 
quality control (<a href="#sec4a.1.2">Section&nbsp;4a.1.2).</a>

<a id="sec4a.3"></a>
<h3> 4a.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importance of data documentation</h3>

Documentation is essential for assessing data quality. 
Comprehensive and clear documentation should include 
general information (or an introduction) and the 
documentation at value and/or food level in the FCT.
<p></p>
The general information should detail the compilation and 
calculation methods, analytical methods and sampling 
procedures, complete component identification, 
information on the quality of the data, and data 
evaluation, etc.
<p></p>
For the data documentation, presenting metadata at 
value level (i.e. documentation on type of data and source 
for each component value in the FCT) is preferred, where 
possible. Documentation at the value level allows users to 
understand the source and type of value presented (e.g. 
analytical value or borrowed from another FCT), the 
analytical method and/or definition used for each value. If 
documentation at the value level is not possible, it should 
be provided at least at the component level (i.e. 
component identification) and at food level (i.e. sources of 
data used). In either case, bibliographic references, 
recipes and analytical methods that are cited in the FCT 
should be reported in a reference list allowing a cross 
check between the single nutrient values or food entries 
with the original sources.

<a id="sec4a.4"></a>
<h3> 4a.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checking food composition data</h3>

After compiling or updating a FCT using the methods 
outlined in 
<a href="#sec4a.1">Section&nbsp;4a.1</a>,
it is important to carry out systematic 
checks to verify that values are within expected ranges, 
and to check the FCT for internal consistency. 
<p></p>
Checks should be performed at all levels of the database 
preparation, but a final check is highly recommended 
before publishing an FCT. A comprehensive outline of the 
internal checks to be carried out on the food composition 
data and documentation prior to publication is available in the
the FAO/INFOODS "Guidelines for Checking Food 
Composition Data prior to Publication of a User Table/Database"

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2012). FAO/INFOODS Guidelines for checking food 
composition data prior to the publication of a user table/database, version 1.0.">
	(<a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/handle/20.500.14283/i3079e"
	target="right" >FAO, 2012</a>). </span>

In summary, data checking 
can be divided into four main categories including food 
identification, component identification, recipes, and data 
documentation, and can be performed at different levels 
of the database.
<p></p>
<b>Food identification</b> should be complete and unambiguous 
and include all characteristics that may influence the 
nutrient content of foods (see more details in
<a href="#sec4a.2.5">Section &nbsp;4a.2.5)</a>. 
In addition to the food name and 
descriptors, a food group and a unique code should be 
assigned to all foods in the FCT. Checks should cover all 
aspects of food identification (name, description, food 
group and code).
<p></p>
<b>Component identification</b> should precisely describe 
definitions, modes of expression and analytical methods 
applied. It is strongly recommended to use established 
international systems for food component identification 
to facilitate data interchange (see more details in 

<a href="#sec4a.2.3">Section&nbsp;4a.2.3</a> 
and 
<a href="#sec4a.2.4">Section&nbsp;4a.2.4).</a> 

Checks on the components 
should include the component identification plus some 
specific checks that are component-specific

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2012). FAO/INFOODS Guidelines for checking food 
composition data prior to the publication of a user table/database, version 1.0.">
	(<a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/handle/20.500.14283/i3079e"
	target="right" >FAO, 2012</a>). </span>

<p></p>
<b>Recipe</b> calculation procedures are commonly used to 
obtain the nutrient profile for recipes (see more details in 
<a href="#sec4a.1.4">Section&nbsp;4a.1.4).</a> 
Checks should be performed at all stages of the 
calculations, as well as for the final calculated nutrient 
profiles. 
<p></p>
<b>Data documentation</b> refers to both the general 
information of the FCT and the documentation at value 
and/or food level. Data documentation must be detailed 
and comprehensive because it is fundamental for evaluating 
the data quality. Checks should be performed in both 
types of data documentation.

<a id="sec4a.5"></a>
<h3> 4a.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food matching</h3>

Food matching refers to the steps performed to link foods 
from different datasets to food composition data. Food 
matching is a critical step to obtain high quality 
estimations of nutrient intake or to obtain estimations of 
dietary exposure for food safety purposes. Therefore, it is 
crucial to correctly match foods reported in a dietary 
survey with foods from the most relevant, highest quality 
FCT (see 
<a href="#sec4a.6.1">Section&nbsp;4a.6.1). </a> 
When performing food 
matching, the highest quality match should be selected by 
identifying the closest food available, with a complete 
nutrient profile, in the most appropriate FCT.
<p></p>
Before starting the food matching it is important to 
identify the nutrients (or other components) of interest. 
This decision will affect both the FCT selection, because 
components of interest should be present in the FCT, and 
decisions made during the food matching process (e.g. if 
sodium is not included in the list of nutrients of interest, 
salted and unsalted foods could be matched indistinctly) 

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2012). FAO/INFOODS 
Guidelines for food matching, version 1.2.">
	(<a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/handle/20.500.14283/i3079e"
	target="right" >FAO, 2012</a>). </span>

<p></p>
Ideally, high-quality, national or regional FCTs with no 
missing values for the components of interest should be 
selected (see more details in 
<a href="#sec4a.6">Section &nbsp;4a.6).</a> In most 
cases, it is necessary to combine multiple FCTs when 
matching a list of foods. Thus, it is important to make sure 
that the nutrients are interchangeable among the 
different data sources (see more details in
<a href="#sec4a.2.3">Section&nbsp;4a.2.3</a> 

and in
<a href="#sec4a.2.4">Section&nbsp;4a.2.4). </a> 

<p></p>
A stepwise approach to perform food matching is 
described in the  FAO/INFOODS Guidelines for Food 
Matching  (hereinafter referred to as  Matching 
Guidelines)

<span data-tippy-content="FAO. (2012). FAO/INFOODS 
Guidelines for food matching, version 1.2.">
	(<a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/handle/20.500.14283/i3079e"
	target="right" >FAO, 2012</a>). </span>

The Matching Guidelines were 
developed to assist food composition data users and 
compilers in following a harmonized approach while 
pointing out critical steps and information required to 
achieve the most appropriate food matching. The 
Matching Guidelines can also be used by dietary 
assessment experts when performing food matching 
between dietary consumption data and food composition 
data. This can be a challenging process due to several 
factors, including the varying level of detail in which foods 
are described in dietary surveys. Another common 
challenge is the food matching for recipes, that may or 
may not be reported as separated ingredients in the 
dietary data. The use of a common food description 
system between the two types of data, such as FoodEx2, 
may facilitate this matching task. Applying the most 
appropriate matching is essential as it will increase the 
quality of subsequent nutrient intake assessments.
<p></p>
Finally, it is important to document all food matchings. 
This documentation is extremely important to identify the 
source (including releases or edition information) and 
specific item number (code) in the original source. As part 
of the documentation, it is also highly recommended to 
assign quality codes to each match in order to assess the 
quality of the food matching. Quality criteria are detailed 
in the Matching Guidelines, which can be adapted to 
different purposes.

<a id="sec4a.6"></a>
<h3> 4a.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability and quality of food composition tables and databases</h3>

Nutrient content varies significantly across countries due 
to plant and animal varieties consumed, environmental 
conditions, soil composition, agricultural practices, 
fortification programs, product formulation and dietary 
habits (see more information in  
<a href="#sec4a.2.6">Section&nbsp;4a.2.6). </a> 
For example, large differences were noted when the 
micronutrient content in Brazilian foods was compared 
with foods from the USDA database, in particular for some 
minerals and vitamin&nbsp;A 

<span data-tippy-content="Grande, F., Giuntini, E. B., Lajolo, F. M., & 
de Menezes, E. W. (2016). How do calculation method and food data

	<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2014.12.002"
	target="right" >Lopes et al., 2015</a>). </span>

Similarly, comparisons of selected nutrient values 
for animal-source foods across FCTs from high-income 
countries, also revealed variability for the same foods 

<span data-tippy-content="De&nbsp;Bruyn, J., Ferguson, E., Allman-Farinelli, M., 
Darnton-Hill, I., Maulaga, W., Msuya, J., & Alders, R. (2016). Food 
composition tables in resource-poor settings: Exploring current limitations 
and opportunities, with a focus on animal-source foods in 
sub-Saharan Africa. British Journal of Nutrition, 116(10), 1709–1719. ">
	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27821202/"
	target="right" >De&nbsp;Bruyn et al., 2016</a>). </span> 

These variations highlight that using 
different FCTs to estimate nutrient intake may lead to 
different conclusions when assessing nutrient adequacy. 
Therefore, it is crucial to generate and maintain country-
specific FCTs that provide representative data. 
<p></p>
However, publishing or updating FCTs remains a challenge 
for many countries, particularly in LMICs where national 
FCTs are often lacking. As a result, these countries rely on 
food composition data from other countries, which may 
not accurately represent local foods. Developing 
high-quality FCTs is costly and time-consuming, requiring 
analytical laboratories, specialized facilities and trained 
professionals. Therefore, collaboration across sectors, 
including government, universities, researchers and the 
private sector is essential to generate and compile 
country-specific food composition data 

<span data-tippy-content="Micha, R., Coates, J., Leclercq, C.,

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29478333/"
	target="right" >Micha et al., 2018</a>). </span>
 
<p></p>
Even among countries that have developed FCTs, their 
quality, comprehensiveness, and accessibility varies 
widely. Ideally, a high-quality FCT with nationally 
representative data should exist for each country. 
However many countries, especially LMICs, have no 
published national FCT. Even though about 100 countries 
have already published at least one FCT, these vary 
considerably in terms of data quality, data 
documentation, food and component coverage, analytical 
methods used and accessibility 

<span data-tippy-content="Ene-Obong, H., Schönfeldt, H. C., Campaore, E.,

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30698115/"
	target="right" >Ene-Obong et al., 2019</a>). </span> 

Unfortunately, many FCTs rely heavily on outdated or 
borrowed data with limited direct and up-to-date 
analytical data

<span data-tippy-content="Micha, R., Coates, J., Leclercq, C., 
Charrondiere, U. R., & Mozaffarian, D. (2018). Global Dietary Surveillance:

	(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29478333/"
	target="right" >Micha et al., 2018</a>). </span>

Some FCTs cover only 
a limited number of components for a small number of 
raw foods, while mixed dishes and foods that are cooked, 
processed or fortified are often lacking. For example, 
while some national FCTs borrow most or all nutrient 
values from other FCTs, the Indian FCT published in 2017 
exclusively includes newly analyzed data for over 500 raw 
foods, sampled with a statistically valid sampling 
method across the different regions of the country

	(<a href="https://www.nin.res.in/ebooks/IFCT2017.pdf"
	target="right" >Longvah et al., 2017</a>). </span>

<p></p>
Also, a varying range of components are included in FCTs. 
For instance, the SR Legacy database from the United States is 
available online covering around 240 components  

<span data-tippy-content="U.S. Department of Agriculture. (2018).

	(<a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/"
	target="right" >USDA, 2018</a>), </span>

while other FCTs 
available only as a PDF file show a more restricted number 
of components. It is recognized that more than 26,000 
distinct biochemical components are present in foods. Many of these 
remain unquantified and thus the full biochemical 
spectrum of our diets and their effects on health and 
disease are unstudied

The majority of FCTs are developed for a specific country 
or region and include the main foods consumed by a 
population, while other specialized datasets also exist to 
meet specific purposes and needs. For example,

Efforts are also being made 
by various national authorities to collect and to make 
accessible compositional data of branded products 
available from local markets, such as the database for 
global branded products published by the United States 
Department of Agriculture  

<span data-tippy-content="U.S. Department of Agriculture. (2024b).

April 2024. U.S. Department for Agriculture, Agricultural Research ">
	(<a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov"
	target="right" >USDA, 2024</a>). </span> 

Notably, information for branded 
foods is often directly obtained from the food 
manufacturers and thus may not be directly comparable 
(e.g. distinct component definitions) to the main national 
FCTs.
<p></p>
FCTs are available in various formats, including searchable 
websites, PDFs, ASCII, Access, Excel files, and printed 
books. Preparation and dissemination of FCTs in 
accessible formats, in particular Excel, should be 
encouraged to facilitate data use and application. 
Regardless of the format, FCTs should include a 
documentation section detailing nutrient definitions, data 
sources, and other relevant information, along with the 
main dataset.
<p></p>
INFOODS maintains a global directory of FCTs, which is 
regularly updated

	(<a href="https://www.fao.org/infoods/infoods/tables-and-databases/en/"
	target="right" >FAO, 2022b</a>). </span>

The directory of FCTs was 
first compiled by INFOODS in 1988 and is an important 
resource to catalogue available national, regional and 
international FCTs. It also includes specialized datasets 
focused on specific components or food groups. For each 
country or region, the directory aims to provide a 
comprehensive list of available FCTs, along with relevant 
details and weblinks to access them through the 
respective publisher or national data compiler. However, 
many older printed tables are no longer available, and not 
all FCTs are publicly accessible.
<p></p>
EuroFIR AISBL also provides a list of national FCTs on their 
website, focusing on European countries

EuroFIR members 
can access the FoodEXplorer, an online tool that 
integrates European FCTs and those of member countries 
in an online searchable interface, allowing direct 
comparison of component values across datasets

<h3> 4a.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;Selecting an appropriate food composition table or database</h3>

Food composition data are widely used, making data 
quality crucial for accurate analyses and assessments in 
food, nutrition and health research. The reliability of these 
data directly impacts conclusions and actions taken to 
address identified issues. The quality evaluation of a 
published FCT is extremely important for users to 
determine its suitability for their specific needs. Key 
factors to consider when selecting a FCT for use include 
the type and origin of data, methodologies used to 
develop the FCT, accessibility, user-friendliness, 
component coverage and identification, frequency of 
updates, and sources of data.
<p></p>
To assist users and compilers in evaluating the global 
performance of a FCT by using a standardized approach, 
FAO and INFOODS developed the  FAO/INFOODS 
Evaluation framework to assess the quality of published 
food composition tables and databases  (hereinafter 
referred to as Evaluation Framework) 

<span data-tippy-content="Charrondiere, U. R., Stadlmayr, B., Grande, F., 
Vincent, A., Oseredczuk, M., Sivakumaran, S., Puwastien, P., Judprasong, K., 
Haytowitz, D., & Gnagnarella, P. (2023). FAO/INFOODS Evaluation framework to assess the 
quality of published food composition tables and databases &#8209; User guide">
	(<a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/handle/20.500.14283/cc5371en"
	target="right" >Charrondiere et al., 2023</a>). </span>

A summary of the aims and criteria included in 
the Evaluation Framework is available in this video 

<span data-tippy-content="FAO’s contribution to improved quality of dietary data. FAO.">
	(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgodrtC7JzM"
	target="right" >FAO, 2023</a>). </span>

The Evaluation Framework considers different 
aspects of a FCT, such as data documentation available to 
inform users, food coverage and identification, nutrient 
component coverage and description, data quality and last 
update. This assessment helps users to identify the 
strengths and weaknesses of a given FCT enabling 
informed decision-making when selecting food 
composition data for use. Data compilers may also use the 
Evaluation Framework to assess their published FCTs, 
assisting in the identification of strengths along with areas 
of improvement in future editions. Overall, the Evaluation 
Framework benefits both data compilers and users 
working in ministries and government entities, academic 
and research institutions, and private and public sector 
institutions dealing with nutrition, agriculture or health.

<h3> 4a.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INFOODS &mdash; The International Network of Food Data Systems</h3>

Since the 1980's, significant progress has been made in 
the availability and quality of food composition data. A 
key driver of this progress has been the network INFOODS 
established in 1984 under the auspices of the United 
Nations University (UNU) with the active engagement of 
the International Nutrition Foundation. Since 1990, FAO 
has played an active role in INFOODS, serving as the global 
coordinator since 1999. INFOODS is also one of the 
Affiliated Bodies of the International Union of Nutritional 
Sciences (IUNS).
<p></p>
INFOODS operates as a global network of food 
composition experts promoting and supporting initiatives 
to improve the quality, availability, reliability and use of 
food composition data. INFOODS also serves as a forum 
for international harmonization and advocacy in this field. 
<p></p>
FAO and INFOODS have developed and disseminated 
many freely available resources,
including a video on FAO’s work on food composition
