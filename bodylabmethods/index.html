Several indirect in vivo labora&shy;tory
methods are  avail&shy;able to assess body
compo&shy;sition. Their selection
depends on the study objective, the precision and
accuracy required, the cost, conven&shy;ience to the subject and their health, and
equipment and  tech&shy;nical expertise  avail&shy;able.
This chapter describes both
non-scanning and scanning in vivo
labora&shy;tory techniques. Non-scanning techniques
include total body potas&shy;sium, total body water (via isotope dilution or
bio&shy;elec&shy;trical imped&shy;ance analysis (BIA)),
neutron activ&shy;ation analysis,
densit&shy;ometry (via under-water weighing or
air-displace&shy;ment pleth&shy;ysmog&shy;raphy), and
total body elec&shy;trical conduc&shy;tivity.
Four scanning techniques are included:
comput&shy;erized tomog&shy;raphy, magnetic resonance imaging, dual
energy X&#8209;ray
absorp&shy;tiometry (DXA), and ultra&shy;sound. Each technique
gen&shy;er&shy;ates body compo&shy;sition
data in a dif&shy;fer&shy;ent way, so the results are not
inter&shy;changeable. For each technique, the
charac&shy;ter&shy;istics, including both
the advantages, limit&shy;ations and assump&shy;tions
applied to gen&shy;er&shy;ate the body compo&shy;sition data,
are outlined.  In addition, their
potential applic&shy;ations are sum&shy;ma&shy;rized, with
emphasis on the alter&shy;ations in the
relative pro&shy;por&shy;tions of the
body com&shy;po&shy;nents that may occur in certain life-stage
groups or disease states. Such alter&shy;ations may
invalidate the deter&shy;min&shy;ation of fat
and fat-free mass in a 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model of body
compo&shy;sition. In a 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model, constants for
the hydra&shy;tion and density of
fat-free mass which ignore the inter-indi&shy;vidual
variability in these properties, are often assumed.
<p><p>
Many factors have the potential to alter values for these assumed constants,
especially  growth and mat&shy;ura&shy;tion
in children, aging, preg&shy;nancy, and obesity.
Conse&shy;quently, researchers have
developed specific constants for the hydra&shy;tion and
density of fat-free mass specific for these  circum&shy;stances.
Their use will improve
the estimates of fat-free mass
when applying the simple 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model based
on measure&shy;ments of total body
potas&shy;sium, total body water, or whole-body density.
From a com&shy;par&shy;ison of nine in vivo
body compo&shy;sition methods  conducted by Field
and co-workers (2015), measure&shy;ment of
densit&shy;ometry via air displace&shy;ment
pleth&shy;ysmog&shy;raphy was selected as the
method with the highest degree of accuracy
and reliability and with the least degree of
tech&shy;nical error to track and monitor
whole-body compo&shy;sition across the lifespan,
provided any alter&shy;ations in the
relative pro&shy;por&shy;tions
of the body com&shy;po&shy;nents, are taken into account.
<p>
In clinical patients with certain
disease states, over- or under&shy;hydra&shy;tion and
abnor&shy;mal&shy;ities in mineral mass may occur,
resulting in sub&shy;stantial variability in
both the hydra&shy;tion and density of fat-free mass. In these  circum&shy;stances,
applic&shy;ation of multi-com&shy;po&shy;nent
models that include measure&shy;ments of protein and/or
bone minerals (via neutron activ&shy;ation or DXA)
as well as total body water and
density will minimize assump&shy;tions
related to the  structure, hydra&shy;tion, and
density of fat-free mass.
The 4-com&shy;po&shy;nent model is considered the criterion
method whereby whole-body compo&shy;sition
can be most accurately assessed. A
simplified version based on measure&shy;ments
from both DXA and BIA holds promise for
monitoring conditions in certain disease states.
<p></p>
The four scanning techniques are widely used in clinical
settings to quantify in vivo body compo&shy;sition,
especially at the tissue-organ level, when inves&shy;tigations
of bone density, skeletal muscle mass, and the
deposition of visceral ectopic fat
with their corre&shy;sponding relation&shy;ship
with osteo&shy;porosis, sarco&shy;penia, or
cardio&shy;metabolic risk, respectively, are needed.

<h2 id="14.0">14.0 An introduction to
techniques used to measure body compo&shy;sition</h2>

Accurate methods for mea&shy;sur&shy;ing body compo&shy;sition are required
in inves&shy;tiga&shy;tions of obesity, mal&shy;nu&shy;trition, weight loss
following bariatric surgery, muscle wasting, sarco&shy;penia,
osteopenia, and osteo&shy;porosis.  Body compo&shy;sition
infor&shy;mation is also used to
establish the appropriate prognosis and treatment of
hospital patients, and with longitudinal assess&shy;ment, to
monitor the effects of inter&shy;ventions on body compo&shy;sition

<span data-tippy-content="Lemos, T., & Gallagher, D. (2017). Current body compo&shy;sition measure&shy;ment techniques. Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity, 24(5), 310&#8209;314.">

<p></p>
Selection of the method to measure body compo&shy;sition depends
on the required precision and accuracy, the study objective,
cost, conven&shy;ience to the subject, their health, and
equipment and  tech&shy;nical expertise  avail&shy;able

<span data-tippy-content="Lukaski H. C. (1987). Methods for the assess&shy;ment of human body compo&shy;sition: traditional and new. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 46(4), 537&#8209;556.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3310598/"
target="right" >Lukaski, 1987</a>)</span>.

Methods based on multi-com&shy;po&shy;nent models that include
analysis of protein and minerals, minimize assump&shy;tions
related to tissue density, hydra&shy;tion, and structure.  This
is important because in mal&shy;nour&shy;ished indi&shy;viduals, the
elderly, and subjects with metabolic disturbances, the
relative pro&shy;por&shy;tions of the body com&shy;po&shy;nents is often altered,
and losses of protein, fat, and bone mineral content may
occur, often in association with the rapid accumulation of
water.  Changes such as these invalidate the deter&shy;min&shy;ation
of fat and the fat-free mass in the 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model.
<p></p>
Absolute validity cannot be assessed for any of the indirect
 in vivo  body compo&shy;sition methods because the gold stan&shy;dard
for body compo&shy;sition analyses is cadaver analysis.
Instead, only relative validity can be assessed,
defined as the com&shy;par&shy;ison for each subject of the
results from the &ldquo;test&rdquo;
method with the results from another method, termed the &ldquo;refer&shy;ence or
criterion&rdquo; method; the latter having a greater degree of
demonstrated validity.  A&nbsp;4&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model is now
considered suffi&shy;ciently accurate to act as a refer&shy;ence or
criterion method, but its use in many settings is limited
because of the expensive and sophisticated technology
required.  Multiple statistical approaches can be used to
establish the validity of the &ldquo;test&rdquo; method com&shy;pared with a
refer&shy;ence method.  They include regression and correlation
analyses, paired t&nbsp;tests, and more recently, Bland-Altman
analysis; see Earthman

The charac&shy;ter&shy;istics of the various pro&shy;ce&shy;dures
used for mea&shy;sur&shy;ing body compo&shy;sition
are sum&shy;ma&shy;rized in Box&nbsp;14.1. This list includes both non-scanning
and scanning techniques.
Detailed sections (14.2&#8209;14.12)
describe each of these indirect  in vivo
methods now  avail&shy;able to assess body compo&shy;sition. Comments
on these methods are also given, along with the
assump&shy;tions used, and the advantages and disadvantages of each
method.  Scanning techniques such as computer
tomog&shy;raphy (Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.9">14.9)</a>,
magnetic resonance imaging
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.10">14.10)</a>

Each technique gen&shy;er&shy;ates body
compo&shy;sition data in dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ways,
so the methods are not inter&shy;changeable.
Methods with the lowest cost are often the most imprecise.
<p></p>
Methods employing the 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model (i.e., body fat and
fat-free mass) include total body
potas&shy;sium, total body water via isotope dilution
or bio&shy;elec&shy;trical imped&shy;ance, densit&shy;ometry
via hydro&shy;static weighing or
air-displace&shy;ment pleth&shy;ysmog&shy;raphy,
and total body elec&shy;trical conduc&shy;tivity. Such methods are not suitable
for clinical popu&shy;lations when the basic assump&shy;tions of the
2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model are often invalid.  Instead, in these
popu&shy;lations, techniques using
a&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4, or 5&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model
should be applied. For example, (Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.11">14.11</a>)
has the capacity to gen&shy;er&shy;ate data that
can be used with a 3&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model. See Lohman

Three scanning techniques &mdash; comput&shy;erized
tomog&shy;raphy (Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.9">14.9)</a>, magnetic
resonance imaging (Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.10">14.10)</a>, and DXA
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.11">14.11)</a> &mdash; can be used to
quantify components (e.g., skeletal muscle, bone,
visceral ectopic fat) at the tissue-organ level of body
composition as well as to
assess the relative pro&shy;por&shy;tions of the fat-free
mass, body fat, and bone mineral content.  Of
these, only DXA has been
recom&shy;mended for the assess&shy;ment of fat mass in patients with
a variety of disease states; the use of DXA for the
assess&shy;ment of fat-free mass is not recom&shy;mended for
clinical popu&shy;lations because its validity for assess&shy;ment of
fat-free mass in any clinical popu&shy;lation remains unknown

<b>Box&nbsp;14.1. Scanning and non-scanning
labora&shy;tory techniques used to measure body compo&shy;sition.
</b><br><p></p>
<ul	style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><b><a href="#14.1">14.1</a> Chemical analysis of cadavers</b><br>
Cadaver analysis provides the gold stan&shy;dard data on body compo&shy;sition,
but the use of such data is limited by ethical barriers. Results from a
few older studies (1945&#8209;1968) are mostly based on adults who
had died because of illness.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.2">14.2</a> Total body potas&shy;sium (TBK) </b><br>
TBK is mea&shy;sured by counting radiation from naturally
occurring <sup>40</sup>K in a whole body counter.
Required equipment is only found in specialized facilities.
Estimates of the fat-free mass can be derived from the TBK.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.3">14.3</a> Total body water
from isotope dilution (TBW)</b><br>
A tracer dose of water, usually labeled
with the stable isotope <sup>2</sup>H,
is given orally or intra&shy;venously and then allowed to equilibrate.
The concentration of the isotope in serum,
urine, or saliva is mea&shy;sured and TBW calculated
from dilution observed following equilibration.
Obesity, preg&shy;nancy, and wasting disease increase TBW.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.4">14.4</a> Multiple dilution methods</b><br>
Typically, multiple dilution involves determining both total body water
via isotope dilution and extra&shy;cellular water (ECW), the latter
using a tracer such as bromide that does not enter the intra&shy;cellular
space. The dif&shy;fer&shy;ence between these two measure&shy;ments (i.e., TBW &minus;
ECW) reflects the intra&shy;cellular water.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.5">14.5</a> In vivo activ&shy;ation analysis</b><br>
Radioactive isotopes of N, P, Na, Cl, Ca are created by
irradiating the subject. The resulting &gamma;&#8209;radiation
is mea&shy;sured using a whole body counter. Subjects are exposed to
radioactivity.   Sensitivity varies with the element.
Required equipment is only found in specialized facilities.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.6">14.6</a> Densitometry</b><br>
Body density is derived from measure&shy;ments of body
mass and body volume. The latter is calculated from:
(a) the apparent loss of weight when the body is totally
sub&shy;merged in water &mdash; difficult with young children,
the elderly or sick patients &mdash; or, (b) air-displace&shy;ment or
water-displace&shy;ment pleth&shy;ysmog&shy;raphy.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.7">14.7</a> Total body
elec&shy;trical conduc&shy;tivity (TOBEC)</b><br>
Subject lies supine in a solenoid coil through which a
5MHz current is passed. The conduc&shy;tivity value of the subject
is obtained by sub&shy;tracting the back&shy;ground value when
the coil is empty. Edema, ascites, dehydra&shy;tion, electrolyte balance and
variations in bone mass all inter&shy;fere with the conduc&shy;tivity reading.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.8">14.8</a> Bioelec&shy;trical imped&shy;ance (BIA)</b><br>
The imped&shy;ance to a weak elec&shy;trical current passed
between the right ankle and right wrist of a subject
in supine position is mea&shy;sured. Edema, ascites, and dehydra&shy;tion
invalidate single fre&shy;quency measure&shy;ments. Multifre&shy;quency
measure&shy;ments allow estimation of both total and extra&shy;cellular
com&shy;part&shy;ments.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.9">14.9</a> Computerized tomog&shy;raphy (CT) </b><br>
Method measures attenuation of X-rays as they pass
through tissues, the degree of attenuation being related
to dif&shy;fer&shy;ences in physical density of the tissues. An
image is reconstructed from the matrix of picture elements.
Exposure to ionizing radiation limits use of CT
for pregnant women or children. Expensive equipment.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.10">14.10</a> Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI)</b><br>
Imaging involves placing a subject in a very strong
magnetic field and observing the relative dif&shy;fer&shy;ences
in behavior of <sup>1</sup>H protons in lean and adipose tissue.
No expo&shy;sure to ionizing radiation but equipment bulky and expensive.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.11">14.11</a> Dual
energy X&#8209;ray absorp&shy;tiometry (DXA)</b><br>
Utilizes the attenuation of
a dual energy X&#8209;ray beam, often during whole-body
scanning. New fan-beam technologies replacing earlier
pencil-beam techniques lead to lower X&#8209;ray doses
and improved spatial resolution.
High precision method, but results are cali&shy;bra&shy;tion
dependent and dif&shy;fer&shy;ences between various
equipment manufacturers can be signif&shy;icant.
<p></p>
<li><b><a href="#14.12">14.12</a> Ultrasound</b><br>
High-fre&shy;quency sound waves from a combined ultra&shy;sound
source and meter pass through adipose tissue to
the adipose-muscle tissue inter&shy;face. At the inter&shy;face,
some sound waves are reflected back as echoes, which
are trans&shy;lated into depth readings via a trans&shy;ducer.
CT, MRI, or DXA provides higher degree of structure resolution
than ultra&shy;sound.

<h2 id="14.1">14.1 Chemical analysis of cadavers</h2>

Studies of body compo&shy;sition by direct chemical analysis of
human cadavers are limited.  Most of the cadavers were
analyzed between 1945 and 1968 and were adults of varying
ages who had died because of illness; hence, the values
obtained may not be representative of an average healthy
adult.

<h3 id="14.1.1">14.1.1 Applications of cadaver use </h3>

<a href="#table14.1">Table&nbsp;14.1</a> presents data on the contribution of
water and protein to the fat-free mass of six adult
cadavers. The fat-free tissues
of the cadavers were of a relatively constant compo&shy;sition,
containing about 72% water and about 20% protein; the
potas&shy;sium content was also relatively
constant (about 69mmol/kg).   In contrast, the amount of fat was very variable
(data not shown), ranging from 4.3% to 27.9% of body weight
in the six cadavers.
<p></p>

<p class="clearleft">

<h2 id="14.2">14.2 Total body potas&shy;sium (TBK)</h2>

A constant fraction (0.012%) of potas&shy;sium exists in the body
as the radioactive isotope <sup>40</sup>K
(half&#8209;life&nbsp;&equals; 1.3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>y).
This isotope emits a high-energy &gamma;&#8209;ray of 1.46MeV, allowing
the amount of potas&shy;sium in the body to be estim&shy;ated by
counting with a whole-body &gamma;&#8209;spec&shy;trometer with sodium
iodide detectors

<span data-tippy-content="Forbes, G. B., Gallup, J., & Hursh, J. B. (1961). Estimation of total body fat from potas&shy;sium-40 content. Science (New York, N.Y.), 133(3446), 101&#8209;102.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13700686/"
target="right" >Forbes et al., 1961</a>)</span>.

The isotope occurs
in low concentrations so that the back&shy;ground counts from
external radiation (cosmic rays and local sources of
ionizing radiation) must be minimized.  Hence, the
whole-body counter must be shielded from the back&shy;ground
radiation with lead, steel, or concrete shielding.  Counting
times of at least 15min are normally required for adults,
with pro&shy;por&shy;tionately longer times for children and infants.
Such times may be a problem for ill patients.   Note that the required
equipment is expensive, requires sophisticated  tech&shy;nical support: availability is limited.
<p></p>
Calibration of the whole-body counter must be done carefully
because the <sup>40</sup>K count detected by the whole-body counter is

Potassium occurs almost exclusively as an intra&shy;cellular
cation, primarily in the muscle and viscera.  Negligible
amounts occur in extra&shy;cellular fluid, bone, and other
noncellular sites.  Measure&shy;ment of total body potas&shy;sium can
therefore be used as a marker for the body cell mass, and as an
index of the fat-free mass in healthy subjects, on the
assump&shy;tion that the fat-free mass has a constant pro&shy;por&shy;tion
of potas&shy;sium.  Body cell mass represents the total mass of
cells in the body that consume oxygen and produce work
(i.e., the metabolically active, energy-exchanging mass of
the body); it is the nonfat cellular portion of tissues, of
which the primary com&shy;po&shy;nents are skeletal muscle, organ
tissue mass, blood, and the brain

Originally <sup>40</sup>K measure&shy;ments were converted
from the total body potas&shy;sium content into the fat-free mass
using a value of 69.4mmol&nbsp;K per&nbsp;kg fat-free mass
or 2.71g/kg fat-free mass.
These values were derived from cadaver
analysis.  However, a single value for all subjects is now
known to be inappropriate and no longer accepted.  The
potas&shy;sium concentration of fat-free tissue is a function of
age and sex, with both men and women losing on average 5% of
their original total body potas&shy;sium per decade
<a href="#figure14.1">(Figure&nbsp;14.1)</a>.
Women have a lower potas&shy;sium concentration
in the fat-free mass than men.  Note the reduction in total
body potas&shy;sium with age and the large variation within each age group.
The latter emphasizes that total
body potas&shy;sium alone is a poor predictor of fat-free mass
unless age&#8209; and sex-dependent equa&shy;tions are used

The potas&shy;sium concentration of
the fat-free mass also declines with increasing obesity and during
preg&shy;nancy due to the increased hydra&shy;tion of the fat-free
mass.  In obese subjects, some of the decrease may also be
explained by the lower pro&shy;por&shy;tion of muscle in the fat-free
mass and by a measure&shy;ment error resulting from absorption of
the &gamma;&#8209;rays by adipose tissue

Clearly, constants for the potas&shy;sium concentration of the fat-free
mass must consider age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, and
preg&shy;nancy, or estimates of fat-free mass derived from
<sup>40</sup>K measure&shy;ments will be in error, sometimes by as much as 20%.

These uncertain&shy;ties can limit
the applic&shy;ation of the 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model
in clinical popu&shy;lations with certain disease
states, particularly a wasting disease
such as cancer, when total body potassium
measurements are low as a result of loss of muscle mass.
Conse&shy;quently, in these  circum&shy;stances,
use of the 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent
model to derive indirectly total body fat is inappropriate.  Instead,
more sophisticated body compo&shy;sition models,
involving 3&#8209;&nbsp;or 4&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nents,
that reduce the need for
under&shy;lying assump&shy;tions, should be used.

<h2 id="14.3">14.3 Total body water from isotope dilution</h2>

Either the stable isotope deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H),
the radio-active isotope tritium (<sup>3</sup>H),
or the stable isotope of oxygen
(<sup>18</sup>O) can be used to measure total body water.
Of the three, deuterium is now most frequently
used.  Standardized conditions are necessary for the
measure&shy;ment because fluid and food intake and exercise can
all affect total body water concentrations.  As a result,
samples should be taken in the morning,
after an overnight fast and the bladder has been emptied, and with
a restriction of fluid intake.
<p></p>
A tracer dose of sterile water labeled with an accurately
known amount of the isotope (often deuterium oxide, D<sub>2</sub>O)
is administered either orally or intravenously to the
subject and allowed to equilibrate.  Two
samples of serum, or urine, or saliva are collected; one prior to the
administration of the tracer and a second after the isotope has
equilibrated with the subject's water pool (usually 3&#8209;5h
post-dose).  The baseline sample measures the
naturally present isotope in the total body water.
The enrichment observed in the post-dose sample
allows cal&shy;cula&shy;tion of the total body water. The measure&shy;ment of
enrichment appears to be less reliable in urine than in
serum probably because of the longer equilibration period of
the bladder contents relative to blood.
<p></p>
Ideally, no food or water is permitted during equilibration,
which may take 3&#8209;5h, depending on the isotope, the
physiological sample, and the health condition of the
patient.  If fluid has been taken during the equilibrium
period, a cor&shy;rec&shy;tion can be made, where necessary, to derive
actual body water

The isotopic tracer chosen and the method used for analysis

and when repeated measure&shy;ments over a short time period are
necessary.  The non&shy;radio&shy;active
isotope <sup>18</sup>O must be mea&shy;sured
by mass spectrometry.  The stable isotope deuterium is now
the tracer of choice because it is much cheaper than
<sup>18</sup>O and can be mea&shy;sured by infrared absorption, gas
chromatography, an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, and more
recently by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry
(FTIR).  Use of FTIR for deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H) analysis is less
expensive and quicker, although slightly less precise than
the use of an isotope ratio mass spectrometer.  Saliva is
preferred to urine as the chosen body fluid when using FTIR
for the measure&shy;ment because urine may cloud the optical lens

by isotope dilution </h3>

The measure&shy;ment of total body water in both healthy
and diseased persons is the most important applic&shy;ation of
isotope dilution techniques. All body water is present in the fat-free
mass. Hence, total body water measure&shy;ments can
be used to estimate the fat-free mass.
This estimation requires an assumed value for fat-free mass hydra&shy;tion,
as shown below:
\[ \small \mbox {Fat-free mass (kg) &equals; (total body water (kg)) / hFFM
}\]
where hFFM &equals; hydra&shy;tion of the fat-free mass.
<p></p>
Based on the 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model, once the fat-free mass has
been deter&shy;mined, total body fat (TBF) and per&shy;cent&shy;age of body
fat can be calculated as shown below:
\[ \small \mbox {Total body fat (kg) &equals;
body weight (kg) &minus; fat-free mass (kg)
}\]
\[ \small \mbox {% body fat = (Total body
fat (kg) &times; 100%) / body weight (kg)

In healthy adults, hFFM is assumed to be 0.732.  However,
use of a single value for the hydra&shy;tion of fat-free
mass may lead to errors in derived values for the fat-free mass.
For example, hFFM is known to vary
during hormonal cycles in women and in certain disease
states owing to under-hydra&shy;tion. Alternatively, over-hydra&shy;tion due to
edema, may arise among children with severe acute
malnutrition

high&shy;lights the effect of adopting dif&shy;fer&shy;ent hydra&shy;tion
constants on the assess&shy;ment of fat-free mass and fat mass in
a women at 30wks gestation with a normal pre-gravid BMI
(i.e., 24.8kg/m<sup>2</sup>).  Clearly, failure to consider the
increase in hFFM in models based on total body water using
isotope dilution would result in an overestimate of the
actual fat-free mass in pregnant women, and thus
under&shy;estimate fat mass when the 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model is
applied.
<p></p>
Recently, refer&shy;ence charts for infants and children aged
from 6wks to&nbsp;5y by sex have been developed for per&shy;cen&shy;tiles
for total body water mea&shy;sured by deuterium dilution,
and fat-free mass calculated from total body water using
pub&shy;lished  hydra&shy;tion coefficients

These charts will help clinicians identify how specific
diseases and their treatment impact on fat-free mass and fat
mass in this age group.
<p></p>
The error associ&shy;ated with the measure&shy;ment of total body
water using these isotopic tracers is typically less than 1kg.
This error equates to an uncertainty of about 10%
(about 1.4kg) in the absolute fat mass of an average
healthy adult or 2% in the estimate of per&shy;cent&shy;age of fat.
These relatively low errors have resulted in the isotope
dilution method becoming the refer&shy;ence or gold-stan&shy;dard
method in com&shy;par&shy;ison with
other measure&shy;ment pro&shy;ce&shy;dures for
total body water (e.g., bio&shy;elec&shy;trical
imped&shy;ance: Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.8">14.8</a>).
<p></p>
A 3&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model that partitions body weight into three
major com&shy;po&shy;nents can also be used to measure fat-free mass and fat mass:
\[ \small \mbox {
Body mass &equals; fat &plus; water &plus; residual
}\]
where residual (i.e., fat-free <u>dry</u> mass) is the sum
of protein, bone mineral, and glycogen
<p></p>
This 3&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model partitions the body
mass into fat, total body water, and the remaining fat-free dry mass,
which is assumed to have a constant ratio of protein to
mineral.  This 3&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model
avoids the assump&shy;tion that the water content of
fat-free mass is the same for all indi&shy;viduals of a given age
and sex. Instead, the model provides an estimate of the
hydra&shy;tion and density of fat-free mass.  Three measure&shy;ments
are made:  body weight (in&nbsp;kg), body volume (in&nbsp;liters), and
total body water (in&nbsp;liters).  Fat mass can be
calculated from these three basic measure&shy;ments by applying
the 3&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model of Siri

<h2 id="14.4">14.4 Multiple dilution methods</h2>

Multiple dilution can be used to estimate the
volume of various body fluid com&shy;part&shy;ments that, in
turn, can be used to estimate two com&shy;po&shy;nents of
the fat-free mass:  extra&shy;cellular mass (ECM) and the body-cell mass (BCM).
<p></p>
Typically, multiple dilution involves determining both total
body water (via isotope dilution;
Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.3">14.3)</a>
and extra&shy;cell&shy;ular water (ECW),
the latter using a tracer such as bromide that
does not enter the intra&shy;cell&shy;ular space

<span data-tippy-content="Wong, W. W., Sheng, H. P., Morkeberg, J. C., Kosanovich, J. L., Clarke, L. L., & Klein, P. D. (1989). Measure&shy;ment of extra&shy;cellular water volume by bromide ion chromatography. The American journal of clinical nutrition, 50(6), 1290&#8209;1294.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2596421/"
target="right" >Wong et al., 1989</a>)</span>.

The dif&shy;fer&shy;ence between these two measure&shy;ments (i.e.,
TBW &minus; ECW) reflects the intra&shy;cell&shy;ular water (ICW), which is more
metabolically active than ECW and provides an estimate of BCM

<span data-tippy-content="Ribeiro, S. M., & Kehayias, J. J. (2014). Sarcopenia and the analysis of body compo&shy;sition. Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.), 5(3), 260&#8209;267.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24829472/"
target="right" >Ribeiro & Kehayias, 2014</a>)</span>.

<p></p>
To estimate BCM using this approach, a pre-dose blood or urine sample is taken
followed by dosing with deuterium oxide and sodium bromide
solution.  After a 3&#8209;5h equilibration period, a
final post-dose blood or urine sample is collected, although
longer equilibration periods are needed for indi&shy;viduals
with expanded ECW, including those with extreme obesity.
Deuterium enrichment of the bio&shy;logical sample is described in
Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.3">14.3</a>,
whereas bromide enrichment is deter&shy;mined by
high-per&shy;form&shy;ance liquid chromatography or non-destructive
liquid X&#8209;ray fluorescence.  The reported precision for ICW
calculated using this approach is about 2.5% provided
stan&shy;dardized protocols are used

target="right" >Earthman, 2015</a>)</span>.

The ratio of ECW&nbsp;/&nbsp;TBW can also be calculated using this approach.  In a
study of nursing home elderly, the ratio ECW&nbsp;/&nbsp;TBW was
signif&shy;icantly higher com&shy;pared to the ratio in free-living elderly,
prompting the sug&shy;ges&shy;tion that this ratio may have potential
as a surrogate method for the clinical assess&shy;ment of frailty

<h3 id="14.4.1">14.4.1 Application of multiple dilution methods </h3>

The ECM is defined as the com&shy;po&shy;nent of the
fat-free mass which exists outside the cells.  It consists
of both fluid (e.g., extra&shy;cellular fluids, plasma volume)
and solid (e.g., skeleton, cartilage, tendons) com&shy;po&shy;nents
which are involved in transport and support and are not
metabolically active.
<p></p>
In contrast, the BCM is
the total mass of cells in the body that consume oxygen and
produce work (i.e., the metabolically active,
energy-exchanging mass of the body).  These com&shy;po&shy;nents are
the nonfat cellular portion of tissues,
primary the skeletal muscle, organ tissue
mass, blood, and the brain

Measure&shy;ments of BCM and ECM are especially critical in

multicom&shy;po&shy;nent elemental models based on in vivo NAA have
grad&shy;ually become accepted as refer&shy;ence methods for the
cali&shy;bra&shy;tion of many of the other techniques described in
this chapter.
<p></p>
Nearly all the major elements present in the body can be
analyzed by in vivo NAA, including hydrogen, oxygen, carbon,
nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and chlorine (Cohn et
al., 1984).  Of special inter&shy;est is the applic&shy;ation of NAA
to measure the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio  in vivo .  This
ratio can provide an inde&shy;pen&shy;dent, unbiased measure of the
distribution of fat and fat-free mass, which is not
dependent on the assump&shy;tions about the compo&shy;sition of
fat-free mass.  Small changes in fat-free mass can be
monitored, making the method appropriate for studying the
depletion of fat-free mass with aging

A major negative factor associ&shy;ated with in vivo NAA is that
the subject is exposed to radiation.  This and the
associ&shy;ated risks must always be explained to the subject.
In vivo NAA is most used in clinical medicine for the
deter&shy;min&shy;ation of total body nitrogen (TBN), total body
calcium (TBCa), and bone mass as discussed below.
TBN and TBCa are only deter&shy;mined in a relatively small
number of laboratories worldwide &mdash; an indication of the
expense involved and  tech&shy;nical difficulties associ&shy;ated with
the method.

<h3 id="14.5.1">14.5.1 Total body nitrogen by in vivo NAA</h3>

Nitrogen is normally deter&shy;mined by NAA by bombarding the
patient, in a supine position, with a low neutron flux from a
<sup>238</sup>PuBe source or from a cyclotron or neutron generator.
During irradiation, a pro&shy;por&shy;tion of <sup>14</sup>N is converted to an
excited state of <sup>15</sup>N, which decays almost immediately to its
ground state, emitting a &ldquo;prompt&rdquo;
&gamma;&#8209;ray at 10.83MeV.  This
activity is counted by an array of sodium iodide detectors
in a whole body counter

Measure&shy;ment of the
nitrogen content of the body gives a measure of total body
protein because the mass of nitrogen bears a fixed ratio to
the mass of protein (1g&nbsp;N &equals; 6.25g protein).  The radiation
expo&shy;sure using this method is about 0.3mSv.  This compares
with the national back&shy;ground radiation from cosmic and other
sources of about 3.5mSv/y.

<p></p>
The 10.83MeV &gamma;&#8209;ray is specific to nitrogen and is at an
energy which is not affected by inter&shy;ference from other
reactions.  Extensive shielding, how&shy;ever, is necessary
around the sodium iodide detectors to reduce the level of
back&shy;ground radiation.  Never&shy;the&shy;less, cor&shy;rec&shy;tions to the
&gamma;&#8209;count must still be made for the back&shy;ground.
<p></p>
The cali&shy;bra&shy;tion of the counter is critical and must consider
the height, weight, and adiposity of the subject because of
the varying neutron attenuation and internal absorption of
the emitted &gamma;&#8209;rays.  Calibration is achieved using phantoms
or by using hydrogen as an internal stan&shy;dard

The results indicate that sub&shy;stantial losses of body protein may occur,
even when conven&shy;tionally adequate nutritional support has
been provided for some of these patients.  Depleted total
body protein is also a consistent finding among acutely ill
anorexic patients.  In a longitudinal study, Haas et&nbsp;al.

reported that after recovering from anorexia nervosa,
depletion of body protein mea&shy;sured by in vivo INAA remained
in adolescent patients after 7mos, even though body weight
was restored.  Clearly, further work is required to identify
nutritional inter&shy;vention pro&shy;ce&shy;dures which minimize loss of
body protein in hospital patients and those with anorexia nervosa.

<h3 id="14.5.3">14.5.3 Total body calcium by in vivo NAA</h3>

The method is based on
the conversion of a pro&shy;por&shy;tion of the naturally occurring
isotope <sup>48</sup>Ca in the body to <sup>49</sup>Ca
(half-life &equals; 8.8min) by
exposing the patient to a low neutron flux.  Immediately
following irradiation, the patient is transferred to a
whole-body counter, and the &gamma;&#8209;rays emitted by the decay
of <sup>49</sup>Ca are detected by an array of sodium iodide detectors.
<p></p>
The counting geometry is similar to that used for total body
potas&shy;sium, and again care must be taken in positioning the
subject and correctly accounting for the varying height,
weight, sex, and body mass index of subjects.  In
particular, for subjects with BMI &gt;&nbsp;30, the effects of
neutron attenuation become signif&shy;icant, necessitating
additional cor&shy;rec&shy;tions or a special cali&shy;bra&shy;tion

The radiation expo&shy;sure using this method varies from 2.5&#8209;25mSv,
depending on the neutron source.  This range is
considerably higher than that experienced during
dual X&#8209;ray absorp&shy;tiometry (DXA) and
limits the general applicability of the method.
Conse&shy;quently, the use of neutron activ&shy;ation analyses for the
assess&shy;ment of total body calcium has largely been replaced
by DXA (Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.11">14.11</a>).
Instead, the method is now mainly
used as a cali&shy;bra&shy;tion tool for other techniques.

<h2 id="14.6">14.6 Densitometry</h2>

Body density was one of the first measures of body

It is relatively easy to measure, and in the past, body density was
the gold-stan&shy;dard method to determine per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat
using the 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model.
Certain disease states characterized by excess fluid
retention and under-mineralization decrease the density of
fat-free mass.  Conse&shy;quently, densit&shy;ometry is now often
combined with other measures in a 4&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model of
body compo&shy;sition so that
hydra&shy;tion and density of fat-free mass are mea&shy;sured
along with the actual bone mineral content, thus providing a more
accurate assess&shy;ment.

Hydrostatic weighing was the initial densitometric method

However, it is now being replaced by plethysmo&shy;graphic
methods that are more acceptable to subjects, particularly
children

All three methods are described below.  A
concluding section describes the cal&shy;cula&shy;tion of body fat
from body density (Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.6.4">14.6.4</a>).

<h3 id="14.6.1">14.6.1 Hydrostatic weighing</h3>

The conven&shy;tional method of directly mea&shy;sur&shy;ing whole body
density involves weighing the subject and then using
Archimedes' principle to determine the volume of the
subject.  Thus, the subject is weighed first in air and then
when completely submerged in water in a large tank.  The
subject is instructed to squeeze out any air bubbles trapped
inside the bathing suit, and to expel as much air as
possible from the lungs before immersion.  The hydro&shy;static
weight is recorded at the end of the forced expiration.
Multiple readings should be taken using a con&shy;tin&shy;uous and
sen&shy;sit&shy;ive recording of under&shy;water mass, the heaviest
corre&shy;sponding to the most complete expiration.  This method
requires a high degree of water con&shy;fid&shy;ence and thus the
method is not suitable for children younger than 8y, the
elderly, obese, or unhealthy persons.
<p></p>
The body volume is then calculated from the apparent loss of
weight in water (i.e., the dif&shy;fer&shy;ence between the weight of
the person in air and his or her corre&shy;sponding weight in
water).  Once total body mass and body volume have been
deter&shy;mined, whole body density can be readily calculated, on
the basis that density is mass per unit volume and the
density of water is l.0kg/L at 4&deg;C:
\[ \small \mbox {
Whole body density &equals; (body weight in air (kg)) /
(apparent loss in weight (kg))
}\]
Three cor&shy;rec&shy;tions must be applied:
<ul>
<li>Hydrostatic weighing
is usually performed in water at 30&deg;C instead of 4&deg;C.  At
this higher temperature, the density of water is 0.9957kg/L,
and a water temperature cor&shy;rec&shy;tion factor must be
applied.
<li>Air trapped in the lungs also contributes to the
amount of water displaced by the subject under water.
Residual air in the lungs can be mea&shy;sured while the subject
is in the tank.  Alternatively, the volume can be estimated
using a nitrogen washout, helium dilution, or oxygen
dilution

<span data-tippy-content="Brodie, D., Moscrip, V., & Hutcheon, R. (1998). Body compo&shy;sition measure&shy;ment: a review of hydro&shy;densitometry, anthropometry, and imped&shy;ance methods. Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.), 14(3), 296&#8209;310.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9583375/"
target="right" >Brodie, 1988</a>)</span>.

This cor&shy;rec&shy;tion can also be
estimated from empirical equa&shy;tions.  The residual air volume
is then sub&shy;tracted from the body volume.
<li>The volume of the air trapped in the gastrointestinal tract also
contributes to the total amount of water displaced.  This
volume is small and is never mea&shy;sured.  It is often taken as
100mL.
</ul>
The within-subject variability in gastrointestinal
gas volume, how&shy;ever, can be quite large (0&#8209;500mL in
adults), reducing the precision of the method.
Even when the above cor&shy;rec&shy;tions are carefully applied,
considerable uncertainty remains.  If the whole body density
is used to calculate the per&shy;cent&shy;age of body fat (see below),
these uncer&shy;tain&shy;ties become errors in the per&shy;cent&shy;age of body
fat.  The errors may be systematic rather than random in
nature and may be large when the residual air volume is
estimated.  If the residual air volume is in error by 300&#8209;500mL,
there will be a corre&shy;sponding uncertainty in the
per&shy;cent&shy;age of body fat from 3&#8209;5%.
<p></p>
Hydro&shy;static weighing can give very reproducible
results for whole body density, provided that the examiners
and the subjects are well trained.  For example, Durnin and Rahaman

<span data-tippy-content="Durnin, J. V., & Rahaman, M. M. (1967). The assess&shy;ment of the amount of fat in the human body from measure&shy;ments of skinfold thickness. The British journal of nutrition, 21(3), 681&#8209;689.">

for serial measure&shy;ments on three subjects over a 1y period.

<h3 id="14.6.2">14.6.2 Water-displace&shy;ment pleth&shy;ysmog&shy;raphy</h3>

The use of a plethysmo&shy;graph eliminates the necessity for
totally immersing the subject in water, a disadvantage of
hydro&shy;static weighing (Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.6.1">14.6.1</a>).
For the measure&shy;ment, the plethysmo&shy;graph
is zeroed and filled with water

<h3 id="14.6.3">14.6.3 Air-displace&shy;ment pleth&shy;ysmog&shy;raphy</h3>

The measure&shy;ment of body volume has been signif&shy;icantly eased
by the development of an air-displace&shy;ment
pleth&shy;ysmog&shy;raphy device (Bod Pod).  These devices determine the volume
of a subject indirectly by mea&shy;sur&shy;ing the volume of air
displaced by the subject inside an enclosed
chamber &mdash; plethysmo&shy;graph or Bod Pod.  The method is quick, comfortable,
automated, non-invasive, safe, and does not require
extensive  tech&shy;nical training.  For infants up to about 6mos
of age, a device known as the &ldquo;Pea Pod&rdquo; is  avail&shy;able and can
accommodate infants up to about 8kg.  For small children
from 2&#8209;6y, the Bod Pod with a Pediatric
Option can be used, whereas the stan&shy;dard Bod Pod can be used
for older children (i.e., &gt;&nbsp;6y), adults, and the elderly.

The air-displace&shy;ment plethysmo&shy;graph consists of an ovoid
fiberglass structure divided into two sections:  a rear
refer&shy;ence chamber and a front test chamber containing the

The dividing wall between the
two chambers encompasses a large diaphragm.  This can be made to
oscillate under computer control, gener&shy;ating com&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;tary
pressure changes in the test and refer&shy;ence chambers which
are recorded.  These changes and the applic&shy;ation of the
basic gas laws allows the volume of the test chamber to be
calculated.  Measure&shy;ments both with and without a seated
subject provide infor&shy;mation on the total body volume of the
subject.
<p></p>
While they are seated in the test chamber, subjects should
wear minimal clothing, often a swimsuit and
a tightly fitting bathing cap to minimize the volume of air
contained near the hair or skin, and in clothing.
Measure&shy;ments over a 1&#8209;min period usually suffice, and an
average of two separate trials should be used to calculate
body volume.  For details on the methods and per&shy;form&shy;ance of

<h3 id="14.6.4">14.6.4 Application of densit&shy;ometry to calculate body fat</h3>

Once whole-body density has been mea&shy;sured
by one of the methods outlined above,
the per&shy;cent&shy;age body fat can be calculated.  This
involves the selection of an empir&shy;ical densito&shy;metric
equa&shy;tion relating fat content to whole body density (D).
Several empir&shy;ical densito&shy;metric equa&shy;tions
have been derived based on the classic two-com&shy;po&shy;nent model
for body compo&shy;sition.
As noted earlier, in this model body weight is divided into
fat and fat-free mass, and relies on assump&shy;tions that ignore
inter-indi&shy;vidual variability in the compo&shy;sition of the
fat-free mass.
<p></p>
All the classical densitometric equa&shy;tions shown below
assume:
<ul>
<li>The density of the fat-free mass is relatively
constant.
<li>The density of fat for normal persons does not
vary among indi&shy;viduals.
<li>The water content of the fat-free mass is constant.
<li>The pro&shy;por&shy;tion of bone
mineral (i.e., skeleton) to muscle in the fat-free body is
constant.
</ul>
The dif&shy;fer&shy;ent authors all assume the
density of fat and the fat-free mass do not change with age and sex.
There are two
constants in each equa&shy;tion, C<sub>1</sub>
and C<sub>2</sub>, the dif&shy;fer&shy;ent authors suggesting slightly
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent values for each:
\[ \small \mbox {
%F = ((4.950/D) &minus; 4.500) &times; 100% (Eq.A)
}\]
\[ \small \mbox {
%F = ((4.570*/D) &minus; 4.142) &times; 100% (Eq.B)
}\]
\[ \small \mbox {
%F = ((5.548*/D) &minus; 5.044) &times; 100% (Eq.C)
}\]
The Siri (1961) equa&shy;tion (Eq.A) is most widely used and assumes that
the densities of fat and fat-free mass are about 0.90 and 1.10kg/L respectively.
Bro&#382;ek et&nbsp;al.

(Eq.C) used the concept of a
refer&shy;ence man of a specified density and compo&shy;sition; these
equa&shy;tions avoid the requirement of esti&shy;mat&shy;;ing the density of
fat-free mass.  The constants applied in all these equa&shy;tions
came from the chemical analysis of a few adult cadavers
dissec&shy;tions, animal data, and indirect estimates of fat-free
mass in human subjects

<p></p>
None of these classical empirical equa&shy;tions
relating fat content to body density, how&shy;ever, are suitable
for adult patients in clinical settings when the compo&shy;sition
of their fat-free mass may be abnormal.  This will include
patients under&shy;going hyper&shy;alimentation with high-sodium
fluids, or with congestive heart failure or liver disease,
as total body water content as a fraction of fat-free mass
may be markedly higher in these patients, thus violating the
assump&shy;tion that the water content of the fat-free mass is a
constant (i.e., 73.2%).  In these patients, the density of
fat-free mass is decreased.
Not surprisingly, in patients
with diseases associ&shy;ated with under-mineralization, the
density of fat-free mass is also decreased

<span data-tippy-content="WERDEIN, E. J., & KYLE, L. H. (1960). Estimation of the constancy of density of the fat-free body. The Journal of clinical inves&shy;tiga&shy;tion, 39(4), 626&#8209;629.">
(<a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13844010/"
target="right" >Werdein & Kyle, 1960</a>)</span>.

Conse&shy;quently, in all these patients, fatness will be
overestimated when the 2&#8209;com&shy;po&shy;nent model is applied

<span data-tippy-content="Wells, J. C., & Fewtrell, M. S. (2006). Measuring body compo&shy;sition. Archives of disease in childhood, 91(7), 612&#8209;617.">

target="right" >Wells & Fewtrell, 2006</a>)</span>.

More recent research has raised concerns
over the assump&shy;tion of constant properties for hydra&shy;tion and
density of fat-free mass when these classical empirical
equa&shy;tions are applied to assess body compo&shy;sition not only in
patients with certain diseases, but also in healthy children
and adolescents, the elderly, pregnant women and those with
obesity, as noted earlier.
<p></p>
Although fat has relatively uniform properties
throughout the life course (zero water and a density of
0.9007kg/L), in contrast fat-free mass has dif&shy;fer&shy;ent
properties in children com&shy;pared to adults.  This arises
because of chemical mat&shy;ura&shy;tion of the fat-free mass during
growth which results in higher levels of water and lower
levels of mineral and proteins, and thus changes in the
hydra&shy;tion and density of the fat-free mass

Their results confirmed that the previously

fat-free mass when applied to pediatric popu&shy;lations were
inappropriate. They developed new empirical age&#8209; and

The extent of the change depends
on the overall elec&shy;trical conduc&shy;tivity of
the body and, in particular, on the pro&shy;por&shy;tions of fat and
the fat-free mass in the body: the fat-free mass, comprised
largely of water with dissolved electrolytes, will readily
conduct an applied electric current, whereas fat is
anhydrous and a poor conductor.  In more modern

To inter&shy;pret TOBEC measure&shy;ments in terms of the quantity of
fat-free mass in the body, a cali&shy;bra&shy;tion equa&shy;tion is applied

to the TOBEC value of each indi&shy;vidual.  A cali&shy;bra&shy;tion

TOBEC is relatively insen&shy;sit&shy;ive to shifts of fluid or
electrolytes between the intra&shy;cellular and the extra&shy;cellular
com&shy;part&shy;ments and to variations in bone mineral&shy;ization.  For
example, in a study of middle aged and elderly subjects
(35&#8209;90y), higher values for fat-free mass were reported when
predicted from measure&shy;ments based on TOBEC com&shy;pared to those
for fat-free mass predicted by using densit&shy;ometry or hydrometry

These find&shy;ings led to the
sug&shy;ges&shy;tion that the higher fat-free mass values arise
because the TOBEC signal is unaffected by decreases in bone mineral&shy;ization.

<h2 id="14.8">14.8 Bioelec&shy;trical imped&shy;ance</h2>

The use of bio&shy;elec&shy;trical imped&shy;ance (BIA) for the assess&shy;ment
of body compo&shy;sition is wide&shy;spread, in large part due to the
affordability, porta&shy;bility, and ease of use of the
bio&shy;impe&shy;dance devices.  None of the BIA devices measure body
compo&shy;sition directly.  They measure an elec&shy;trical response
of the body, resis&shy;tance, when exposed to an elec&shy;trical
current.  The resis&shy;tance mea&shy;sured is transformed into a
pre&shy;dic&shy;tion of total body water by an algorithm, and from
that the body fat mass is deter&shy;mined.
<p></p>
Three categories of BIA devices are  avail&shy;able commercially:
single-fre&shy;quency (SF&#8209;BIA), multiple-fre&shy;quency (MF&#8209;BIA), and
bio&shy;impe&shy;dance spec&shy;tros&shy;copy (BIS); these are described below
together with some new developments in BIA.  Both the SF&#8209;BIA
and MF&#8209;BIA devices rely upon popu&shy;lation-specific pre&shy;dic&shy;tion
equa&shy;tions.  In contrast, BIS uses bio&shy;physical modeling to
estimate body com&shy;part&shy;ments.  All the algorithms are based on or
validated against other body compo&shy;sition refer&shy;ence methods,
which are not totally accurate and error-free.  Each BIA device
works with an inbuilt algorithm specific to the device and
for the popu&shy;lation for which the algorithm was developed so it is
not possible to compare studies unless the same combination
of device / equa&shy;tion / popu&shy;lation is used

</b>
<p></p>	
<b>Preparing for the measure&shy;ment</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Food/beverage and activity.</b>
Individual should fast (no food that day except water) and
avoid alcohol, caffeine, and exercise for at least 8h
prior to measure&shy;ment in the morning (research settings);
shorter time frames and other times of day may
be acceptable in the clinical setting &mdash; note
time of day for consistency in follow-up measures.
<li><b>Void bladder</b>. Individual should void bladder prior to measure&shy;ment.
<li><b>Clean skin surface</b>. Clean skin surface well with alcohol;
indi&shy;vidual should not use lotion or oils on the skin prior to
measure&shy;ment; avoid placing elec&shy;trodes on broken skin.
<li><b>Device cali&shy;bra&shy;tion</b>. Calibrate the bio&shy;impe&shy;dance
device according to the manufacturer’s recommendations prior to measure&shy;ment.
<li><b>Height and weight</b>. Obtain an accurate measure of height and weight.
</li></ul>

<b>Testing conditions and considerations</b>
<ul>	
<li><b>Device placement</b>. Place device on a nonmetal surface,
at least 1m away from electronic or magnetic devices.
<li><b>Ambient temperature</b>.
Avoid excessively warm or cool ambient temperature.
<li><b>Electrodes and leads</b>. Use elec&shy;trodes with
sufficient surface area (&ge;&nbsp;4cm<sup>2</sup>);
store elec&shy;trodes in sealed bag away from heat; use
device-specific leads provided by manufacturer.
<li><b>Electrode placement</b>. Place elec&shy;trodes at least
5cm apart, if possible; proximal
elec&shy;trodes should never be moved from stan&shy;dard
anatomical site placement; if necessary, the
distal elec&shy;trodes may be moved to achieve at least 3cm
of separation; the most important thing is to
measure and record distance between elec&shy;trodes to ensure
placement consistency for follow-up measure&shy;ments.
<li><b>Side of body</b>. If using stan&shy;dard tetrapolar placement
of elec&shy;trodes, measure on the same side of the body as previous
measures; in indi&shy;viduals with amputations,
muscle atrophy, or other abnormal conditions, use
the nonaffected side, if possible; be consistent on
side of measure&shy;ment for follow-up. Right-side
measure&shy;ments are commonly used in the literature.
<li><b>Body positioning and limb separation</b>.
Body position should be supine, except for
stand-on scale devices, with arms separated &ge;30&deg; from the
trunk and legs separated by about 45&deg;; in indi&shy;viduals
with overweight and obesity, separate arms from trunk
and legs from each other using rolled cotton towels/blankets.
<li><b>Fluid and electrolyte status</b>.
Note if serum electrolytes are abnormal;
it is best to conduct bio&shy;impe&shy;dance measure&shy;ments only when
serum electrolytes are normal.
Note if edema is present; edema causes lower resis&shy;tance values.
<li><b>Menstrual cycle in women</b>.
Note menstrual cycle; be consistent in terms of
timing for follow-up measure&shy;ments.
<li><b>Timing of measure&shy;ment</b>.
If indi&shy;vidual is ambulatory, indi&shy;vidual should assume
a supine position for 5&#8209;10min; stan&shy;dardize
the timing for measure&shy;ments by noting the time
when the indi&shy;vidual assumes the supine position and the
time when you take the measure&shy;ment (eg, at 10&nbsp;minutes),
and ensure consistency of timing for all followup
measure&shy;ments. Note if indi&shy;vidual is confined to bed.
<li><b>Repeat measure&shy;ments</b>.
Repeat measures recom&shy;mended for research studies.

The level of precision
produced by both SF&#8209;BIA and MF&#8209;BIA devices is said to be
good, with variability between repeat measures reported as
1%&#8209;2%.  For BIS measure&shy;ments, precision is more variable
(i.e., 2%&#8209;3%)

results in clinical settings, especially for indi&shy;viduals

Like TOBEC (Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.7">14.7</a>),
BIA also depends on the
dif&shy;fer&shy;ences in elec&shy;trical conduc&shy;tivity of a weak alternating
current which flows at various rates depending on the
compo&shy;sition of the body.  The current is well conducted by
tissues with a high water and electrolyte content such as
blood and skeletal muscle but is poorly conducted by adipose
tissue, bone, and air-filled spaces which have a low water
and electrolyte content.  The voltage decrease of the
current as it passes through the body is detected through
current sensing surface elec&shy;trodes, and the imped&shy;ance data
are recorded by the BIA device.  See Kyle et&nbsp;al.

for details of the theory of BIA.
<p></p>
The placement of the adhesive elec&shy;trodes to the body is
important and varies, depending on the device and whether
whole-body or segmental measure&shy;ments are sought.  The
stan&shy;dard placement is a wrist-ankle tetrapolar arrangement
on the hand and foot of one side of the body.
Alternatively, the elec&shy;trodes can be placed on both sides of
the body on both limbs using an 8-electrode arrangement, or
on dif&shy;fer&shy;ent segments of the body.  For the stand-on BIA
devices, direct contact with the elec&shy;trodes is achieved at
the feet and/or hands depending on the device.
<p></p>
The extrapolation from raw imped&shy;ance data to volume depends
on several key assump&shy;tions.  For example, one of the
assump&shy;tions is that stature is an acceptable surrogate for
the unknown true length of the conductor, whereas another
assumes the human body is comprised of five cylinders of
uniform cross-sectional area.  Unfortunately, these assump&shy;tions
are often violated, especially those related to body
dif&shy;fer&shy;ences in geometry in indi&shy;viduals with obesity and/or
longer or shorter than average limbs.  With the introduction
of segmental and MF&#8209;BIA techniques, some of the limit&shy;ations
of the BIA method for these indi&shy;viduals have been overcome.
For patients with clinical conditions in which hydra&shy;tion is
altered (e.g., heart or liver failure), how&shy;ever, assuming a
fixed hydra&shy;tion will yield body compo&shy;sition estimates that
are inaccurate.  For a detailed description of the
assump&shy;tions, see Mulasi et&nbsp;al.

bio&shy;elec&shy;trical imped&shy;ance (SF&#8209;BIA)</h3>

Single fre&shy;quency BIA devices (SF&#8209;BIA) were the earliest
devices developed.  With these, the imped&shy;ance of a
weak elec&shy;trical current (typically 500&#8209;800mA) and a single
current fre&shy;quency (i.e., typically 50kHz) is passed between
two elec&shy;trodes, usually located in the stan&shy;dard wrist-ankle
tetrapolar arrangement on one side of the body, as shown in

<p></p>
To derive fat-free mass,
total body water (TBW) is predicted from raw imped&shy;ance
data by applying an appropriate regression equa&shy;tion and the
use of the assumed hydra&shy;tion constant for fat-free mass
(i.e., typically 0.732 for a healthy adult)
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.3">14.3</a>).
However, as discussed earlier (see
Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.3">14.3</a>
and Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.4">14.4</a>),
many factors influence the hydra&shy;tion of fat-free
mass which have the potential to limit the accuracy of the
estimates of fat-free mass from SF&#8209;BIA data.
<p></p>
Theoretically, the imped&shy;ance mea&shy;sured at a single fre&shy;quency
(e.g., 50kHz) from a SF&#8209;BIA device is unable to
dif&shy;fer&shy;entiate between
extra&shy;cellular (ECW) and intra&shy;cellular water (ICW)
(or body cell mass, BCM).  Many SF&#8209;BIA
devices produce pre&shy;dic&shy;tions of these outputs based on
assump&shy;tions that may hold true in healthy indi&shy;viduals but
not for those who are obese or sick.

<h3 id="14.8.2">14.8.2 Multiple-fre&shy;quency
bio&shy;elec&shy;trical imped&shy;ance (MF&#8209;BIA)</h3>

Multiple-fre&shy;quency BIA devices (MF&#8209;BIA) measure imped&shy;ance at
two or more frequencies, typically at 4&nbsp;or 5&nbsp;frequencies,
including at least one low (most commonly 5kHz) and several
higher ones (typically 50, 100, 200, and 500kHz).  At lower
frequencies the imped&shy;ance to current flow allows for the
deter&shy;min&shy;ation of the extra&shy;cellular water space (ECW),
whereas at the higher frequencies (i.e., &gt;&nbsp;50kHz) the
imped&shy;ance to current allows for the deter&shy;min&shy;ation of ECW and
intra&shy;cellular water space (ICW) (i.e., TBW).  The volume of
ICW, derived by sub&shy;tracting ECW from TBW, can be used to
estimate body cell mass (BCM) based on the assump&shy;tion that
cells are comprised of 70% water.
<p></p>
Several popu&shy;lation-specific pre&shy;dic&shy;tion equa&shy;tions are
 avail&shy;able to predict ECW, TBW, ICW, and BCM based on
refer&shy;ence values derived from appropriate criterion methods.
Never&shy;the&shy;less, again under&shy;lying assump&shy;tions may be violated
in those indi&shy;viduals with obesity and in certain clinical
popu&shy;lations, lead&shy;ing to errors, high&shy;lighting the importance
of not accepting, without question, the output from a BIA device which uses the
proprietary equa&shy;tions of the manufacturer

Many validation studies of BIS conducted in healthy and

at the popu&shy;lation level can be achieved, agreement between
refer&shy;ence methods and BIS at the indi&shy;vidual level is poor,

imped&shy;ance analysis</h3>

The questionable validity of BIA approaches for the
assess&shy;ment of whole body compo&shy;sition estimates in clinical
popu&shy;lations, especially those with abnormal body geometry or
altered fluid homeostasis, has led to the use of raw BIA
measure&shy;ments  per se  for bedside assess&shy;ment of nutritional
status and/or clinical out&shy;comes.  Raw BIA data are
inde&shy;pen&shy;dent of the use of regression pre&shy;dic&shy;tion models and
assump&shy;tions of constant chemical compo&shy;sition of the fat-free
mass, unlike the measure&shy;ments from SF&#8209;BIA and MF&#8209;BIA
devices.  The raw BIA data used comprise single-fre&shy;quency
(50kHz) phase-sen&shy;sit&shy;ive measure&shy;ments to determine:  (i)
phase angle, and (ii) the ratio of multifre&shy;quency imped&shy;ance values.
<p></p>
<b>Phase angle</b> is estimated directly by a phase-sen&shy;sit&shy;ive BIA
device without additional conversion to specific body
com&shy;part&shy;ments, followed by com&shy;par&shy;ison with
popu&shy;lation-specific refer&shy;ence values.  Phase angle is also
inde&shy;pen&shy;dent of the body weight and height of an indi&shy;vidual
patient.  The phase angle concept is based on changes in
resis&shy;tance and reactance as alternating currents pass
through evaluated tissues, providing infor&shy;mation on
hydra&shy;tion status and cell mass; for more details see Lukaski et&nbsp;al.

Low phase angles values are typically
related to more-severe illnesses and worse overall health
out&shy;comes.  Currently, the major challenge of using phase
angle for clinical assess&shy;ment is the lack of consensus on
the choice of cut-points to identify malnutrition (or poor
clinical out&shy;comes)

However, as stated for phase angle, the lack of a consensus on the

for more details.  The regression equa&shy;tion chosen must be
matched closely to the charac&shy;ter&shy;istics of the subject.

Use of a fat-free mass index has also been explored for its
potential to predict nutritional status and/or clinical
out&shy;comes.  The index is gen&shy;er&shy;ated from 50kHz data and is a

<h2 id="14.9">14.9 Computerized tomog&shy;raphy </h2>

Computerized tomog&shy;raphy (CT) is a high-resolution imaging
technique that is widely used in clinical settings to
quantify in vivo body compo&shy;sition at the tissue-organ level.
Total adipose tissue, sub&shy;cutaneous adipose tissue, and
visceral adipose tissue can be assessed.  Com&shy;puter&shy;ized
tomog&shy;raphy can also measure skeletal muscle, indi&shy;vidual
muscle, or muscle groups, and evaluate the quality of muscle
by identifying the infiltration of fat within the muscle, a
condition known as myosteatosis.  Computerized tomog&shy;raphy is
especially useful for inves&shy;tigating quantitative and
qualitative changes in muscle and fat in the trunk area
where the use of DXA is limited.
<p></p>
Computerized tomog&shy;raphy (CT) is based on the relation&shy;ship between
the attenuation of an X&#8209;ray beam and the physical
density of the tissues through which the beam has passed.
The known dif&shy;fer&shy;ences in attenuation of X&#8209;rays between lean
soft tissue and adipose tissue can be used to distinguish
these tissues as well as to determine mixtures of them.
From this relation&shy;ship, a two-dimensional high-resolution
radiographic image of the under&shy;lying anatomy of the scan
area can be constructed.
<p></p>
The CT scanner is made up of two com&shy;po&shy;nents:  a collimated
X&#8209;ray source and detectors, and a computer that processes
the scan data and produces an X&#8209;ray image.  The subject lies
on a movable platform within the scanner gantry.  The
designated area to be scanned is a plane through the middle
of the central aperture of the gantry and parallel to the
gantry.  The X&#8209;ray beam is made to rotate around the
subject, gener&shy;ating a cross-sectional &ldquo;slice&rdquo; through the
patient.  As the X&#8209;rays pass through the tissue, the beam
under&shy;goes atten&shy;uation, and the intensity is recorded
and stored in the scanner computer.  The latter then
processes the stored infor&shy;mation by using a series of
complex algorithms to construct a cross-sectional image
<a href="#figure14.11">(Figure&nbsp;14.11)</a>.
Multiple images gen&shy;er&shy;ated following the movement of the
patient through the scanner gantry are used to produce an
integrated scan of the subject.

<p></p>
The integrated scan shows varying degrees of shading according to the
magni&shy;tude of the X&#8209;ray beam attenuation, which, in turn,
depends on the physical density of the scanned tissues.
Tissues with a greater density cause a greater absorption of
X&#8209;ray energy and, consequently, a higher attenuation value.
The demarcation between tissues of differing density &mdash;
adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, bone, and visceral organs &mdash; can be
very good.

<p></p>
The use of comput&shy;erized tomog&shy;raphy is limited by its
high-dose radiation expo&shy;sure and high cost.  Efforts have
been made to reduce the radiation dose by using a lower-dose
protocol, essential when planning a CT scan in a child

A new technique with extremely low radiation expo&shy;sure,
shorter scan time, and relatively low cost com&shy;pared to whole
body CT, termed &ldquo;peripheral quantitative computer tomog&shy;raphy&rdquo;
(pQCT) has been developed.  This new technique has been
used primarily to inves&shy;tigate bone mineral content and to
assess bone fragility in older patients

The region of special interest for the study of body compo&shy;sition
using CT scans is the third lumbar vertebra (L3).  This is
the region where a single image of a cross- sectional area
provides the best correlation of whole-body skeletal muscle
volume.  The validity and accuracy of body compo&shy;sition
measure&shy;ments by CT based on cross-sectional area of tissues
have been validated by studies of human cadavers, although
no validation of the cal&shy;cula&shy;tion of tissue volume has been performed

Increasingly, CT scans are also being used to identify
CT-defined sarco&shy;penia, a condition associ&shy;ated with a
decrease in muscle mass and function which, although
originally described in the elderly, is also of concern
among the chronically ill nonelderly

To date, how&shy;ever, there are no clear
diagnostic cutoff values for CT to identify sarco&shy;penia based
on skeletal muscle mass, which has limited the applic&shy;ation
of CT for clinical use.

<h2 id="14.10">14.10 Magnetic resonance imaging</h2>

Unlike computer tomog&shy;raphy or DXA, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) does not use ionizing radiation so that the
technique can be used on infants, and
for long-term follow-up when multiple scans on the same
person are required.  The MRI technique is mainly used to
evaluate the quantity and distribution of adipose tissues
and skeletal muscle mass, although it can also detect
changes in body compo&shy;sition, even in the presence of small
body weight changes

In older equipment, scanning times of 10min were necessary, but in
more modern equipment, this has been reduced to under 2min.
Never&shy;the&shy;less, the MRI technique requires  tech&shy;nical
expertise, is expensive, and the equipment is bulky

Magnetic resonance imaging uses dif&shy;fer&shy;ences in the nuclear
magnetic resonance properties of hydrogen atoms in organic
and non-organic environments to distinguish signals
origin&shy;ating from fat, fat-free mass, and free water.  The
hydrogen protons behave slightly dif&shy;fer&shy;ently in adipose
versus lean tissues.  The dif&shy;fer&shy;ences are in the relaxation
time that it takes for the nuclei to release the
radio-fre&shy;quency-induced energy and return to a random
con&shy;figur&shy;ation.  These dif&shy;fer&shy;ences can be used to map the
distribution of adipose versus lean tissue in the body

The imaging process involves placing the subject in a very
strong magnetic field.  Some of the nuclei in the body
attempt to align themselves relative to the applied field.
The effect is particularly marked for <sup>1</sup>H&nbsp;protons.  Only a
small fraction of the protons become aligned, but they are
suffi&shy;ciently numerous for the effect to be detectable when
the field is removed or altered.  It is then that the
dif&shy;fer&shy;ences between the lean and adipose tissue become
apparent.

<h3 id="14.10.1">14.10.1 Application of magnetic resonance imaging </h3>

Magnetic resonance imaging is often used in clinical settings,
when, instead of using whole body imaging
which is time consuming and expensive, sectional body
compo&shy;sition studies that often employ the L3&nbsp;lumbar
vertebra as the landmark, are used.
This landmark has the highest correlation
with whole body skeletal muscle and visceral fat volume.
Alternatively, to identify sarco&shy;penia in older adults, a
single-slice at the mid-thigh level can be
used as this provides a good estimate of skeletal muscle and
fat volume in the thighs, and correlates with clinical
criteria; see Lee et&nbsp;al.

<h2 id="14.11">14.11 Dual energy X&#8209;ray absorp&shy;tiometry</h2>

Dual-energy X&#8209;ray absorp&shy;tiometry (DXA) is a technique that
can be used with indi&shy;viduals (except pregnant women) across
the entire age range and at relatively low cost.
DXA is widely used to assess body compo&shy;sition, with an
overall precision that exceeds that of any other body
compo&shy;sition method

<span data-tippy-content="Prado, C. M., & Heymsfield, S. B. (2014). Lean tissue imaging: a new era for nutritional assess&shy;ment and inter&shy;vention. JPEN. Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition, 38(8), 940&#8209;953.">

With the latest generation of densitometers,
body compo&shy;sition can be assessed with a single whole-body
scan so that radiation expo&shy;sure is low with a minimal acquisition time.
In addition, the newer instruments enable
indi&shy;viduals with extreme obesity to be scanned.

Modern DXA
scanners use an X&#8209;ray source, a
detector, and an inter&shy;face with a computer system for
imaging the scanned area of inter&shy;est. The source gen&shy;er&shy;ates
X&#8209;rays at two dif&shy;fer&shy;ent
energy levels &mdash; 40KeV and 70&#8209;100KeV.
These pass through the body and are
identified by the photon detector that measures the amount
of photon energy absorbed at the two energy levels
by the soft tissue and bone.
Low-density material (i.e., soft tissue) allows more
photons to pass through, so they attenuate the X&#8209;ray beam
less than materials with a higher density, such as bone.
An image is gen&shy;er&shy;ated as the photon detector measures the
dif&shy;fer&shy;ential attenuation (or absorption) of the low and high
X&#8209;rays by the soft tissue and bone.
Only in regions
of the body where no bone is present can measure&shy;ments of the
relative pro&shy;por&shy;tions of fat and lean tissues be made; see

The accuracy of DXA results is influenced by both  tech&shy;nical
and bio&shy;logical factors; these are sum&shy;ma&shy;rized in
<a href="#figure14.13">Figure&nbsp;14.13</a>.
The  tech&shy;nical factors
include dif&shy;fer&shy;ences in
machine cali&shy;bra&shy;tion pro&shy;ce&shy;dures, the
protocols used in demarcating the regions
(arms, legs and trunk) in estimates of body compo&shy;sition,
the positioning of the subject on the scanning bed, and the
effect of clothing.  Sources of biological
variability that can affect accuracy include hydra&shy;tion
status because the hydra&shy;tion of fat-free mass is assumed to
be constant (i.e., about 73%).  Hence, when changes in hydra&shy;tion
status are large (i.e., higher than 5%), as may occur in the
presence of diseases with water retention (e.g., heart,
kidney or liver failure), the fat-free mass is over-estimated

In older DXA models, obesity was also a
factor limiting accuracy, but newer instruments allow
larger and heavier indi&shy;viduals to be scanned.  Finally, the
ability to compare body compo&shy;sition estimates between DXA
manufacturers is limited because of variations in the
hardware and software packages used by manufacturers,
high&shy;lighting the urgent need for universal cali&shy;bra&shy;tion of
DXA machines

Dual-energy X&#8209;ray absorptiometryis now the
primary method for gener&shy;ating accurate data on bone
mineral content and density for the diagnosis of
osteo&shy;porosis (see Chapter&nbsp;23 for more details). DXA is also widely used to
assess body compo&shy;sition, with an overall precision that
exceeds that of any other body compo&shy;sition method

<span data-tippy-content="Prado, C. M., & Heymsfield, S. B. (2014). Lean tissue imaging: a new era for nutritional assess&shy;ment and inter&shy;vention. JPEN. Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition, 38(8), 940&#8209;953.">

Both total and regional estimates of the
three body com&shy;part&shy;ments &mdash; fat-free mass, body fat, and bone
mineral content &mdash; can be deter&shy;mined.  However, DXA does not
have the ability to discriminate between visceral,
sub&shy;cutaneous, and ectopic fat present in organs such as
liver or muscle.
<p></p>
Estimates of the appendicular skeletal muscle
mass (ASM) can be obtained from DXA.  These estimates are
gen&shy;er&shy;ated by summing the amount of lean soft tissue (LST) of
the arms and legs, as they are composed mainly of muscle
(except for a small amount of connective tissue and skin)

<span data-tippy-content="Prado, C. M., & Heymsfield, S. B. (2014). Lean tissue imaging: a new era for nutritional assess&shy;ment and inter&shy;vention. JPEN. Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition, 38(8), 940&#8209;953.">

From these estimates, the ASM
index can be calculated by dividing the arm and leg
lean soft tissue (LST) by
height squared.  Both the ASM and the ASM index values are
considered the gold stan&shy;dard method for the diag&shy;nosis of
sarco&shy;penia.  For pub&shy;lished  cutoff points to define

<h2 id="14.12">14.12 Ultrasound</h2>

Diagnostic ultra&shy;sound, also called sonography,
is an imaging technique used in clinical settings to
measure various tissue thicknesses, including muscle, bone,
and sub&shy;cutaneous and visceral adipose tissue.  The device is
portable, low cost, and capable of making fast and
noninvasive regional estimates of body compo&shy;sition with no
expo&shy;sure to ionizing radiation.  Conse&shy;quently, this scanning
technique can be used in children and pregnant women and is
suitable for large epidemiological studies, although the
results gen&shy;er&shy;ated are highly dependent on the skill of the
operator.
<p></p>
The ultra&shy;sound technique involves
the use of high-fre&shy;quency sound waves from
a transducer.  These penetrate the skin surface and pass through the
adipose tissue until they reach the muscle tissue.  At the
adipose-muscle tissue inter&shy;face, a pro&shy;por&shy;tion of the sound
waves are reflected back to the transducer as echoes.
Hence, the transducer both transmits and receives the
ultra&shy;sound.  The degree of reflection is dependent on the
changes in acoustic imped&shy;ance (i.e., the product of tissue
density and acoustic velocity) between two tissue
inter&shy;faces.  The higher the acoustic imped&shy;ance, the stronger
the gen&shy;er&shy;ated reflection, and thus, the better the quality
of the image.
<p></p>
The acoustic imped&shy;ance of fat and muscle are somewhat
similar and much lower than bone which has a relatively high
acoustic imped&shy;ance; air has almost no imped&shy;ance.
Conse&shy;quently, there is a weaker echo at the fat-muscle
inter&shy;face than at the muscle-bone inter&shy;face.  When the
transducer receives the beam, it converts the echo into
electric signals to form a two-dimensional image.  The
relative strength, or amplitude, of echoes is apparent from
the brightness of the image on the computer screen, with
strong reflect&shy;ions appearing white, weaker reflections grey,
and no echoes black.  As a result, a grey-scale image is
produced with white borders for the skin-subcutaneous fat
and muscle-bone inter&shy;faces and a visible, but less distinct
border for the fat-muscle inter&shy;face;  see Wagner

for more details.
<p></p>
However, the inter&shy;pretation of ultra&shy;sound images is
difficult and depends on the  tech&shy;nical expertise of the
operator who must identify the inter&shy;faces and measure the
thickness of the tissue layer of interest using electronic
calipers.  Care is needed to identify and place the two
caliper points at the boundaries of the tissue to be
mea&shy;sured.  An automated discrimination method is  avail&shy;able
to identify the tissue boundaries for some ultra&shy;sound
devices, although studies comparing the automated method
with the manual discrimination are limited

<p></p>
To use ultra&shy;sound, the measure&shy;ment site is marked with a
water-soluble transmission gel that provides acoustic
contact without depression of the dermal surface.  The
high-resolution transducer is then placed without loss of
contact with the skin so that the ultrasonic beam is
perpendicular to the tissue inter&shy;faces at the marked site.
A transducer receives the echoes and translates them into
depth readings viewed on a computer screen.
Thicknesses of 100mm or more can be mea&shy;sured, and density
inter&shy;faces can be detected with an accuracy of 1mm.  The
tissue is not com&shy;pressed, thereby eliminating errors
associ&shy;ated with variations in the com&shy;press&shy;ibility of
skinfolds

The American Society for

the use of ultra&shy;sound to assess body compo&shy;sition in a
clinical setting, based on their systematic review of seven studies

More research is needed to
develop consensus on the optimal method to conduct
ultra&shy;sound measure&shy;ments
and to gen&shy;er&shy;ate popu&shy;lation-specific
refer&shy;ence data so that the method can be used to assess lean
tissue and diagnose malnutrition in a clinical setting

<h2 id="14.13">14.13 Summary - Method com&shy;par&shy;isons </h2>

Increasingly, clinicians are using the
more robust and reproducible in vivo
methods de&shy;scribed in this chapter to
measure body compo&shy;sition in view of the
limit&shy;ations of BMI as a proxy for
adipos&shy;ity and the recog&shy;nition that
dif&shy;ferences in body compo&shy;sition are associ&shy;ated
with an increased risk of
diseases across the life&shy;span. Such diseases
may include AIDS-associ&shy;ated
wasting, dia&shy;betes, osteo&shy;porosis,
sarco&shy;penia, cardio&shy;vascular disease, and
anorexia nervosa. Even during early infancy, changes in
body compo&shy;sition (both
fat and fat-free mass) can provide more
under&shy;standing of the init&shy;iators and
mediators of the develop&shy;mental origins
of adult cardio&shy;metabolic disease

However, no single in vivo method has the ability to
track body compo&shy;sition accurately from infancy to adulthood; all have
strengths and technological limit&shy;ations.  Fields and co-workers

not applicable; NV, not valid or little data exist in determining validity; P,
probative data support its validity, precision, and reliability in this

When compiling this table, the invest&shy;igators
con&shy;sid&shy;ered the techno&shy;logical
limit&shy;ations of each method, and the follow&shy;ing four criteria:
<ul>
<li>Cost of the measure&shy;ment / device
<li>Level of patient cooper&shy;ation needed for accurate results
<li>Feasi&shy;bility in obtain&shy;ing an interp&shy;retable
result given the patient’s age
<li>Apprec&shy;iation of the age of the patient
relative to the assump&shy;tion of the under&shy;lying
prin&shy;ci&shy;ples in the chosen method.
</li>
</ul>
Based on their review of the methods listed
for whole-body assess&shy;ment in <a href="#table14.6">Table&nbsp;14.6,</a>

chose air dis&shy;place&shy;ment pleth&shy;ys&shy;mography
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#14.6.3">14.6.3</a>)
as the method with the highest degree of accuracy and
reli&shy;abil&shy;ity and with the least
degree of tech&shy;nical error across the life span.
Cur&shy;rently a &ldquo;suite&rdquo; of air
dis&shy;place&shy;ment pleth&shy;ysmo&shy;graphic devices are avail&shy;able
which can be used to track and monitor body compos&shy;ition from birth, into
adol&shy;escence and through&shy;out adult&shy;hood;
