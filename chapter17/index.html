<p>
The assessment of the iron status of the population is
critical:  iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency is the most frequently occurring
micronutrient de&shy;fi&shy;ciency in low-income and industrialized
countries.
</p>

<h4>Functions of iron</h4>
<p>
The human body contains about 2.5 to 4g of elemental iron.
Of this, about 70% is present in the hemo&shy;globin, the
oxygen-carrying pigment of the red blood cells that plays a
critical role in transferring oxygen from lung to tissues.
Hemoglobin is made up of four heme subunits, each with a
polypeptide chain of globin attached.  Each molecule of heme
consists of a protoporphyrin IX molecule with one iron atom.
In addition, about 4% of body iron is present in myoglobin,
the oxygenbinding storage protein found in muscle.  The
structure of myoglobin is similar to hemo&shy;globin, except that
it contains only one heme unit and one globin
chain.
</p>

<p>
Trace amounts of iron are also associated with electron
transport and several enzymes.  Examples include the
heme-containing cytochromes that serve as electron carriers
within the cell, iron-sulfur proteins (flavoproteins,
heme-flavoproteins) that are required for the first reaction
in the electron transport chain, and hydrogen peroxidases
(e.g., catalase and peroxidase).  The cytochrome P450 family
of enzymes also contain heme and are located in microsomal
membranes of liver cells and intestinal mucosal cells.  Key
functions of cytochrome P450 involve detoxification of
foreign substances in the liver, and synthesis of steroid
hormones and bile acids

</span>
</p>

<p>
In addition to these functional forms, as much as 25% of
total body iron is present as storage iron, found primarily
in the liver.  Smaller amounts occur in the
reticulo-endothelial cells of the bone marrow and spleen;
and in the muscle tissues.  Of the storage iron,
approx&shy;imately two-thirds consists of ferritin, the soluble
fraction of the nonheme iron stores.  Small quantities of
ferritin can be synthesized in all cells of the body, even
those with no special iron storage function.  Ferritin also
appears in small concen&shy;trations in the serum but is not
involved in iron transport.  The remain&shy;der of storage iron
is insoluble hemo&shy;siderin

<p>
Stored iron serves as a reservoir to supply cellular needs,
mainly hemo&shy;globin production, and is especially important in
the third trimester of pregnancy.  The size of the storage
component is most strongly influenced by age, sex, body
size, and either the magnitude of iron losses or the
presence of diseases of iron overload
<span title="Brittenham GM, Danish EH, Harris JW.  (1981).  Assessment of
  bone marrow and body iron stores:  old techniques and new
  technologies.  Seminars in Hematology 18:  194&ndash;221.">

 target="right" >Brittenham et al.,1981</a>).
 </span>
</p>

<p>
Iron transport is carried out by the transport protein
transferrin.  The latter delivers iron to the tissues by
means of cell membrane receptors specific for transferrin
(<a href="#17.8">Section&nbsp;17.8</a>).  About 20&ndash;30mg of iron cycles through the
transport component each day.
</p>
<h4>Absorption and meta&shy;bolism of iron</h4>
<p>
Three main factors in the body operate to maintain iron
balance and prevent iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency and iron overload.
These are:  (a) intake, (b) storage, and (c) loss of iron.
The interrelationship of these factors has now been
described mathematically, so that the amount of storage iron
can be predicted as long as iron losses and bioavailability
of iron are known
<span title="Hallberg L, Hulth&eacute;n L, Garby L. (1998).  Iron stores in man
  in relation to diet and iron requirements.  European Journal
  of Clinical Nutrition 52:  623&ndash;631.">

 target="right" >Hallberg et al., 1998</a>).
 </span>
</p>

<p>
The two different forms of dietary iron, heme and nonheme,
are absorbed by separate mech&shy;anisms.  Heme iron is derived
from the hemo&shy;globin and myoglobin in meat, and is absorbed
readily as the intact moiety.  Nonheme iron is found
primarily in plant-based foods, meat, and iron-fortified
foods, and is absorbed from the common nonheme pool within
the gut.  The absorption of nonheme iron is affected by the
simultaneous ingestion of many other dietary components;
some inhibit and others enhance nonheme iron absorption.
</p>

<p>
Inhibitors of nonheme iron absorption include phytate and
polyphenols, as well as certain vege&shy;table proteins (e.g.,
soybean protein).  Calcium inhibits both nonheme and heme
iron absorption, although the precise mech&shy;anism is unclear.
In contrast, vitamin&nbsp;C, other organic acids, and animal
tissues (meat, fish, and poultry) enhance nonheme iron
absorption

<p>
The amount of iron in the stores varies widely, depending on
sex and iron status.  The iron bound to ferritin is more
readily mobilized than iron bound to hemo&shy;siderin.  In cases
of chronic iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency, iron stores in the bone marrow,
spleen, and liver are depleted first, after which tissue
iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency occurs.  In contrast, when iron balance is
positive, iron stores gradually increase.  In general,
depletion of iron stores alone does not have any adverse
functional consequences, although there are some exceptions

<p>
Total daily iron losses are small and occur mainly in the
feces (0.6mg/d), although very small amounts are also lost
in desquamated skin cells and sweat (0.2 to 0.3mg/d), and
in urine (&lt;&nbsp;1mg/d).  In premenopausal women, total iron
losses are larger (about 1.3mg/d) because of the additional
loss of iron in menstrual blood.  On average, menstrual
blood loss is 30 to 40mL per cycle or 0.4 to 0.5mg iron
per day, although in some women it is much greater

</p>

<p>
Most of the iron in eryth&shy;ro&shy;cytes is
recycled for hemo&shy;globin synthesis at the end of their
functional lifetime (i.e., on average 120d).  At this time,
the eryth&shy;ro&shy;cytes are degraded by the macrophages of the
reticular endothelium, and the iron is rereleased in the
form of iron bound to transferrin or ferritin.  This process
is termed iron turnover; each day 0.66% of the total iron
content of the body is recycled in this way.  For more
details on the functions, absorption, and meta&shy;bolism of iron see

<h4>
  Deficiency of iron in humans</h4>
<p>
Iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency is particularly prevalent in infants, young
children, and pregnant women.  It may arise from inadequate
intakes of dietary iron, poor absorption, excessive losses,
or a com&shy;bin&shy;ation of these factors.  In normal circumstances,
only a small amount of iron is lost each day, with the
exception of menstrual losses in premenopausal women.
</p>

<p>
Overt physical manifestations of iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency include anemia,
angular stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, hypochlorhydria,
and koilonychia (spoon nails).  Behavioral disturbances such
as pica, character&shy;ized by the abnormal consumption of
nonfood items such as dirt (geophagia) and ice (pagophagia),
can also occur.  Other less-specific physiological
manifestations that are associated with iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency
include fatigue, anorexia, tiredness, impaired exercise or
work performance, developmental delay, and cognitive
impairment.  These functional consequences of iron
de&shy;fi&shy;ciency are most likely to occur when the iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency
is accompanied by a measurable decrease in hemo&shy;globin
concen&shy;tration

Whether adverse pregnancy
outcomes such as preterm delivery and higher maternal
mortality are associated with iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency is still
uncertain

<h4>Food sources and dietary intakes </h4>
<p> High iron foods include liver, kidney, mussels, and red
  meat.  Foods with a medium iron content include chicken,
  processed meat, fish, and legumes (non-heme iron only).
  Milk and milk products are poor sources of dietary iron

  probably ranges from 15% to 18%, provided they contain ample
  quantities of flesh foods and ascorbic acid.  In low-income

  generally much lower, so that absorption of dietary iron is
  probably only about 5%&ndash;10%

<h4> Development of iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia </h4>
<p> Three stages in the development of iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia can
  be recognized and are best character&shy;ized by the use of
  multiple indices (<a href="#17.9">Section&nbsp;17.9</a>).  The three stages are the
  following: </p>
<p>
<span class="topic">Iron depletion,</span>
  the first stage, is character&shy;ized by a
  progressive reduction in the amount of storage iron in the
  liver.  At this stage, the supply of iron to the functional
  compartment is not compromised so levels of transport iron
  and hemo&shy;globin are normal.  However, the progressive
  depletion of iron stores will be reflected by a fall in
  serum ferritin concen&shy;trations. </p>
<p>
<span class="topic">Iron-deficient erythro&shy;poiesis,</span>
, the second stage, is
  character&shy;ized by the exhaustion of iron stores and is also
  referred to as &ldquo;iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency without anemia&rdquo;.  At this
  stage the iron supply to the erythropoietic cells is
  progressively reduced and decreases in transferrin
  saturation occur (<a href="#17.5">Section&nbsp;17.5</a>).  At the same time, there
  are increases in serum transferrin receptor (<a href="#17.8">Section&nbsp;17.8</a>)
  and eryth&shy;ro&shy;cyte protoporphyrin concen&shy;trations (<a href="#17.7">Section&nbsp;17.7</a>).
  Hemoglobin levels may decline slightly at this
  stage, although they usually remain within the normal range. </p>
<p>
<span class="topic">Iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia,</span>
  the third and final stage of iron
  de&shy;fi&shy;ciency, is character&shy;ized by the exhaustion of iron
  stores, declining levels of circulating iron, and presence
  of frank microcytic, hypochromic anemia.  The main feature
  of this stage is a reduction in the concen&shy;tration of
  hemo&shy;globin in the red blood cells, arising from the
  restriction of iron supply to the bone marrow.  Decreases in
  the hematocrit and red cell indices also occur (<a href="#17.2">Sections&nbsp;17.2</a>
  and  <a href="#17.3">17.3</a>).  Examination of a stained blood film allows
  confirmation of the presence of hypochromia and
  microcytosis. </p>
<p> The different measures of iron status are each discussed in
  the remain&shy;der of this chapter, starting with those used in
  the diagnosis of anemia &mdash; hemo&shy;globin and hematocrit. </p>

<h2 id="17.1" >17.1 Hemoglobin</h2>

<p> Iron is an essential component of the hemo&shy;globin molecule,
  the oxygen-carrying pigment of red blood cells.  Each
  hemo&shy;globin molecule is a conjugate of a protein (globin) and
  four molecules of heme.  Measurement of the concen&shy;tration of
  hemo&shy;globin in whole blood is probably the most widely used
  test for iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia.  It is important to note
  that some misclassification will always arise because the
  range of hemo&shy;globin values for normal nonanemic persons
  overlap with values for persons with iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency.  This
  means that hemo&shy;globin should not be used as the only measure
  of iron status in indiv&shy;iduals.  Indeed it can only be used
  as the sole indicator of iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia in
  populations under very specific circumstances
  (<a href="#17.1.3">Section&nbsp;17.1.3</a>).
  The use of hemo&shy;globin as a measure of iron status
  has other, more specific, limitations, as discussed below. </p>
<h3 id="17.1.1">17.1.1 Factors affecting hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;trations</h3>
<p>
<span class="topic">Biological variation</span> in hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;trations are
  sig&shy;nif&shy;icant.  Hemoglobin values tend to be lower in the
  evening than in the morning, by amounts of up to 10g/L.
  Day-to-day variation is low.
<p>
<span class="topic">Age and sex</span> are important determinants, particularly for
  younger subjects:  median hemo&shy;globin values rise during the

  </p>
  Sex differences in hemo&shy;globin
  are apparent at 6&nbsp;mo of age, with boys having sig&shy;nif&shy;icantly
  lower hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;trations than girls.  Such
  discrepancies appear to be greater in infants with a birth
  weight &lt;&nbsp;3500g

  </span>  By the second
  decade of life, however, females have lower values that
  change very little after 12y of age.  Hemoglobin levels of
  males during adolescence are strongly influenced by
  testosterone and thus by the age of sexual maturation.  In
  young adults, the hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;tration for men is on
  average about 20g/L higher than for women.  These
  sexrelated differences diminish gradually with increasing
  age.

  to use multiple bio&shy;chem&shy;ical tests for iron status because
  of cost or operational constraints.  It is also useful in

  In iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency, the hematocrit falls after hemo&shy;globin
  formation has become impaired.  As a result, in early cases
  of moderate iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency, a marginally low hemo&shy;globin

  Only in more severe

 <ul>
<li>Poor sensitivity with

</li>
<li>Poor specificity, as hematocrit is affected by the same factors that influence

</li>
<li>Poor precision, particularly

<li>Values that are age and sex dependent

 </ul>
<p> Hematocrit, like hemo&shy;globin, is usually determined on
  EDTA-anticoagulated blood from a venipuncture or capillary
  blood.  The measurement is relatively easy, rapid, and often
  used in screening for iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia, although the
  technical errors for the measurement of hematocrit are
  greater than for hemo&shy;globin.  Measurement errors may result
  from: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Poorly packed iron-deficient cells, resulting in
    spuriously elevated values</li>
  <li>Improper mixing of blood caused
    by intermittent blood flow from the puncture site</li>
  <li>Excessive anticoagulant in the collection tube (e.g., if
    collection tube is not filled with blood)</li>
  <li>Dilution of
    blood by an alcohol solution because the finger was not

  macrocytic anemia resulting from vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> or folic acid
  de&shy;fi&shy;ciency, and anemia of chronic inflammation (also known
  as anemia of chronic disease).  The anemia of chronic
  inflammation (e.g., due to rheumatic fever, Crohn&#39;s disease,
  or ulcerative colitis) results from a defect in iron
  recycling.  There appears to be a defect in the release of
  iron from macrophages, or the transfer of iron from the
  reticulo&shy;endothelial cells to plasma trans&shy;ferrin, or both.
  The anemia is generally mild, and can be normochromic and
  normocytic or slightly hypochromic and microcytic

  more detail in Section&nbsp;22.1.1.  In iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia,
  the fall in hemo&shy;globin is followed by a fall in mean cell
  volume, then mean cell hemo&shy;globin, and finally mean cell
  hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;tration.
<h3 id="17.3.1">17.3.1 Mean cell volume</h3>
<p> Mean cell volume or mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a
  measure of the average size of the red blood cells expressed
  in femtoliters (fL).  Cells may be abnormally large
  (macrocytosis), as in vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> or folic acid de&shy;fi&shy;ciency,
  or abnormally small (microcytosis), as in iron and vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>6</sub> de&shy;fi&shy;ciency.
  Mean cell volume is best determined directly
  with an electronic counter as results obtained in this way
  are highly reproducible.  If an electronic counter is not
  available, mean cell volume can be calculated from the
  hematocrit and the red blood cell count determined manually

<p> If both the hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;tration and the hematocrit are
  known, the concen&shy;tration of hemo&shy;globin in the red blood
  cells can be determined.  This is known as the mean cell
  hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;tration (MCHC) and is calculated as: </p>
<p>
\[\small MCHC (g/L) = \frac {hemo&shy;globin\ (g/L)} {hematocrit\ (vol. f\kern-1.5ptraction)}\]
</p>
<p> The MCHC is normally determined with an electronic counter,
  although manual determinations are possible.  After the
  first few months of life, MCHC is less affected by age than
  any other red cell index

  Nevertheless, this index is the least useful of the red cell
  indices because it is last to fall during iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency.
  Mean cell hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;trations are low in
  iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia but normal in

  Values of &lt;&nbsp;300g/L indicate hypochromia and are associated

<h2 id="17.4">17.4 Red cell distribution width</h2>
<p> Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of the
  variation in red cell size (i.e., anisocytosis).  It is
  normally expressed as the coefficient of variation of the
  mean cell volume: </p>

  <p>
\[\small RDW(\&percnt;) = \frac {SD\ of\ MCV\ (f\kern-1.5ptL) &times; 100\&percnt;} {MCV\  (f\kern-1.5ptL)}\]
</p>

<p> The RDW can be determined routinely as part of a complete
  blood count on many automated electronic counters.  Some
  counters output only the standard deviation as the measure
  of RDW. </p>
<p> Red cell distribution width increases in
  iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia and was included as a marker of iron
  status in the NHANES&nbsp;III survey

  </span>

  A single cutoff for RDW of 14% was used in NHANE&nbsp;III.  Using
  this, 65% of women of African descent aged 20&ndash;49y with an
  elevated RDW were also iron deficient based on the ferritin
  model <a href="#17.6">(Section&nbsp;17.6</a>); 36% were anemic.  In contrast, only 6%
  with a normal RDW showed similar signs of iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency,
  and only 5% were anemic.  For children 1&ndash;2y, the
  sensitivity of this cutoff was sig&shy;nif&shy;icantly worse,
  suggesting that different cutoffs are needed for children
  and adults.

  disorders based on a com&shy;bin&shy;ation of a low, normal, and high
  MCV and two categories of RDW &mdash; normal (&lt;&nbsp;15.1%) and high

</p><p>

Clearly, a high RDW is not specific for iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency.
  High values also occur in folate or vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub> de&shy;fi&shy;ciency
  and when iron and folate, or iron and vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>
  deficiencies coexist.  Also, in some hemo&shy;globinopathies
  (e.g. in S&nbsp;&beta;-thalassemia and SS and SC hemo&shy;globinopathy) RDW
  is elevated

     (<a href="#table179A">Table&nbsp;17.9</a>).

  </p>

  However, iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia
  results in a greater increase in RDW than does the
  microcytic anemia of the hemo&shy;globinopathy S&nbsp;&beta;-thalassemia

<h2 id="17.5">17.5 Serum iron, TIBC, and trans&shy;ferrin saturation</h2>
<p> Three interrelated variables, serum iron, total iron-binding
  capacity (TIBC), and trans&shy;ferrin saturation are very useful
  for differentiating between nutritional iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency and
  anemia arising from chronic infections, inflammation, or
  chronic neoplastic diseases.  Nutritional iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency is
  character&shy;ized by a low serum iron, elevated TIBC and, thus,
  low trans&shy;ferrin saturation, whereas in chronic infections,
  inflammation, or chronic neoplastic diseases, both serum
  iron and TIBC are low, so trans&shy;ferrin saturation tends
  towards the low end of the normal range. </p>
<p> Almost all iron in the serum is bound to the iron transport protein
  trans&shy;ferrin.  In the fasting state, serum iron levels
  reflect iron in transit from the reticulo&shy;endothelial system
  to the bone marrow.  Each molecule of trans&shy;ferrin (MW&asymp;80kDa)
  can be bound to one or two atoms of iron, although
  usually only about one third of the binding sites are occupied. </p>
<p> The TIBC is the sum of all unfilled ironbinding sites on
  trans&shy;ferrin, and is measured as the total quantity of iron
  (&mu;mol/L) that saturates all of the iron-binding sites on
  trans&shy;ferrin after the addition of exogenous iron to serum.
  Hence, TIBC is closely related to the concen&shy;tration of
  trans&shy;ferrin.  The TIBC of serum rises once the iron stores
  are depleted because of an increase in trans&shy;ferrin synthesis
  in response to increased iron absorption.  This increase in
  TIBC occurs before there is any evidence of an inadequate
  supply of iron to erythropoetic tissue. </p>
<p> Serum iron and TIBC
  are usually determined at the same time, and the trans&shy;ferrin
  saturation is then calculated, as shown below.  trans&shy;ferrin
  saturation measures the iron supply to the erythroid bone
  marrow:  as the iron supply decreases, the serum iron
  concen&shy;tration falls and the saturation of trans&shy;ferrin
  decreases. </p>

    <p>
\[\small transf\kern-2.0pterrin\ sat.(\&percnt;) = \frac {serum\ iron\ (&mu;mol/L)}{TIBC\ (&mu;mol/L)} &times; 100\&percnt;\]
</p>


<p> Levels &lt;&nbsp;16% saturation indicate that the rate
  of delivery of iron is insufficient to maintain normal
  hemo&shy;globin synthesis.  However, low trans&shy;ferrin saturation
  levels are not specific for iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency, as discussed
  below. </p>

  In general, serum iron values tend
  to be elevated in the morning, decreasing in the afternoon
  and evening.  As a result, measurements of serum iron should
  be determined on fasting morning blood samples.  In this
  way, the effects of both recent dietary intake and diurnal
  variation are minimized. </p>
<p> TIBC is less subject to biological
  variation &mdash; especially diurnal effects &mdash; than is serum iron,
  but it is more susceptible to analytical errors.

<span class="topic">Chronic disease states,</span> infection, inflammatory conditions,
  and chronic neoplastic diseases typically produce both low
  serum iron and low TIBC and, hence, a trans&shy;ferrin saturation
  that tends toward the low end of the normal range.  These
  trends are the result of defects in the release of iron from
  the reticulo&shy;endothelial cells and the subsequent transport
  of iron from these stores by trans&shy;ferrin.  Together, these
  defects result in a shortage of iron in the bone marrow,
  despite adequate or even slightly increased iron stores.  As
  the iron stores are adequate, the body does not respond to
  the fall in serum iron by increasing absorption of iron from
  the diet.  Con&shy;sequently, trans&shy;ferrin synthesis
  is not increased, and levels of TIBC are low.  Hence, the

  low trans&shy;ferrin saturation associated with the anemia of

  normal limits, whereas the TIBC is often high-normal or even
  high, a trend com&shy;parable to that observed in iron

  Once iron stores become exhausted, however, serum
  ferritin concen&shy;trations no longer reflect the severity of
  the iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency state.  Serum ferritin is the only
  measure of iron status that can reflect a deficient, excess,
  or normal iron status.
  Evidence for the quantitative relationship between serum
  ferritin and storage iron includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Stainable bone marrow stores correlate
positively with serum ferritin levels.
</li>
<li>Iron removal by phlebotomy produces a&nbsp;fall
in serum ferritin levels, the decline paralleling changes in
liver iron stores as measured by liver biopsy.
</li>
<li>Iron therapy and repeated
blood transfusions generate a&nbsp;positive
response in serum ferritin levels.
</li>
</ul>
<p> Translation of serum ferritin values into the size of the
  iron stores should be made cautiously, in view of the
  limited knowledge of this relationship and the con&shy;found&shy;ing
  factors that influence serum ferritin concen&shy;trations.  There
  is also considerable between-subject variation in the
  relationship between serum ferritin and tissue iron.  In
  normal healthy subjects with serum ferritin concen&shy;trations
  from 20 to 300&mu;g/L, a serum ferritin concen&shy;tration of 1&mu;g/L is
  said to be equivalent to approx&shy;imately 10mg of

<h2 id="17.7">17.7 Zinc protoporphyrin and free eryth&shy;ro&shy;cyte protoporphyrin</h2>
<p> There is some confusion in the literature because
  protoporphyrin is reported as both zinc protoporphyrin
  (ZnPP) and total metal-free eryth&shy;ro&shy;cyte protoporphyrin
  (FEP).  Indeed, in many of the earlier studies these two
  terms were used inter&shy;changeably.  This arose, in part,
  because in the early analytical procedures, ZnPP was
  unknowingly converted to FEP during analysis. </p>
<p> Zinc protoporphyrin is a product of disordered heme
  biosynthesis.  If the supply of iron is adequate, heme is
  synthesized by the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin
  IX by ferrochetalase.  However, when there is insufficient
  iron for this reaction to occur, zinc is substituted for
  iron, forming ZnPP instead of heme.  The ZnPP then
  accumulates within the iron-deprived circulating
  eryth&shy;ro&shy;cytes, where it can be measured in samples of whole
  blood. </p>
<p> Zinc protoporphyrin remains in the eryth&shy;ro&shy;cytes for the
  duration of their lifespan.  Therefore, an increased ZnPP
  concen&shy;tration in the blood indicates that the majority of

  An international TfR certified reference material is urgently
  required to enable different laboratories to calibrate their
  own assays, facilitating comparisons across countries.
  Recommendations on the assay protocol by the ICSH are also
  needed.  In the future, assays on whole-blood spots dried on
  filter paper may be possible

<h2 id="17.9">17.9 Multiple indices</h2>
<p> The use of several different measures of iron status
  simultaneously provides a more valid assessment of iron
  status than any single measurement because the
  misclassification that can occur due to overlapping normal
  and abnormal values for a single measure is minimized.
  Moreover, multiple measures differentiate the severity of
  iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency more readily.  A com&shy;bin&shy;ation of three tests
  of iron status are frequently used, with abnormal values for
  at least two of the three tests indicating iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency.
  At present, there is no consensus on the best definition of
  iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency when based on multiple measures. </p>

  two models were used to assess
  the relative prevalence of impaired iron status and anemia
  in selected groups of the U.S. population:  one model
  involved ferritin, and one used MCV
   (<a href="#figure179A">Figure&nbsp;17.9</a>).

<iframe src="figures/fig17-9.htm" name="figure179AFrame" id="figure179A" style="width:470px;height:600px"></iframe>

  In the
  ferritin model, serum ferritin, trans&shy;ferrin saturation, and
  FEP were included, whereas the MCV model was based on MCV,
  trans&shy;ferrin saturation, and FEP.  In NHANES III, indiv&shy;iduals
  with iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency, based on at least two of three
  abnormal values in the ferritin model, concurrent with low
  hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;trations, were considered to have
  iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia

  It is noteworthy that neither model can provide a definitive
  diagnosis of iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency because none of the measures
  (with the exception of serum ferritin) distinguishes between
  changes resulting from iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency and those arising
  from infection or inflammation.  The cutoff values used in
  the NHANES III survey are presented in
      <a href="#table1714A">Table&nbsp;17.14</a>.

<p> The inclusion of serum TfR as one of the laboratory criteria is
  recommended because of its ability to distinguish the anemia
  of chronic disease from iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia,
  even in the presence of chronic infection or inflammation.

    (<a href="#figure178A">Figure&nbsp;17.8</a>).

  Hence, in future surveys, a com&shy;bin&shy;ation of
  serum TfR, serum ferritin, and hemo&shy;globin measurements may
  be used to describe the iron status of a population:  serum
  ferritin levels reflect the decline and eventually the
  exhaustion of body iron stores; serum TfR reflects the
  degree of de&shy;fi&shy;ciency in functional iron after the stores
  have been depleted, even in the presence of the anemia of
  chronic disease; hemo&shy;globin measures the presence of anemia.
  This com&shy;bin&shy;ation may be especially useful because it
  provides diagnostic information over a wide spectrum of iron
  status, ranging from replete iron stores to overt iron
  de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia. </p>
<h2 id="17.10">17.10 Summary</h2>
  <p>
      <a href="#table1720A">Table&nbsp;17.20</a>

    <iframe src="tables/table17-20.html" name="table1720AFrame" id="table1720A" style="width:700px;height:650px;"></iframe>

  summarizes the changes in bio&shy;chem&shy;ical measures
  of iron status that occur during each of the three phases in
  the development of iron-de&shy;fi&shy;ciency anemia.  The first phase
  is a decrease in iron stores, reflected by a decline in
  serum or plasma ferritin concen&shy;trations.  The second phase,
  iron-deficient erythro&shy;poiesis, is character&shy;ized by exhausted
  iron stores, reflected by a further decline in serum
  ferritin to &lt;&nbsp;12&mu;g/L, at which time serum TfR levels
  increase.  At about the same time, serum iron concen&shy;trations
  fall to &lt;&nbsp;11&mu;mol/L, which is associated with an elevation
  in TIBC, and a corresponding fall in percentage of
  trans&shy;ferrin saturation to &lt;&nbsp;15%.  Erythrocyte free
  protoporphyrin or the ZnPP :  heme ratio, however, changes
  after the increase in serum TfR, rising to 1.24&mu;mol/L RBCs
  or to &gt;&nbsp;60&ndash;80&mu;mol/mol heme, respectively, because the
  supply of iron is no longer adequate for heme synthesis.  At
  this second stage, the hemo&shy;globin remains within the normal
  range.  In the third and final stage of iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency,
  frank microcytic, hypochromic anemia occurs, when decreases
  in both the hemo&shy;globin concen&shy;tration and the hematocrit
  occur, resulting in a low MCHC.  The presence of hypochromic
  microcytosis can be confirmed at this stage using a stained
  blood film.
          <a href="#table1720A">Table&nbsp;17.20</a>

  also presents the changes in the
  iron status measures that occur during iron overload.  As
  elevated serum ferritin concen&shy;trations also occur during
  chronic inflammatory conditions, measurements of serum iron
  and total iron-binding capacity are the preferred screening
  tests for iron overload. </p>
<p> To provide the best assessment of iron status, several
  measures should be used at the same time.  The presence of
  two or more abnormal values generally indicates impaired
  iron status.  At present there is no consensus on the best
  com&shy;bin&shy;ation to use.  The selection of the most appropriate
  com&shy;bin&shy;ation depends on the health of the indiv&shy;idual(s) and
  on the study objectives.  Diagnosis of iron de&shy;fi&shy;ciency is
  difficult in the presence of other conditions that confound
  the interpretation of laboratory results.  For example, the
  diagnosis may be obscured by the coexistence of chronic
  inflammation, unless serum TfR is determined. </p>
<p> The prevalence of low iron status will vary according to the
  com&shy;bin&shy;ation of measures selected.  When serum ferritin is
  included, prevalence values will always be higher, because
  serum ferritin is the most sensitive measure of the early
  depletion of body iron stores. </p>
