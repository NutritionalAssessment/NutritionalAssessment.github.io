among persons with adequate intakes of iron (right curve) and those known to be responsive to an 
iron supplement (left curve). The two distributions overlap, showing that no single cutoff value 
can separate individuals with adequate iron status from those with inadequate iron status. The 
vertical line marks the hemoglobin value used by WHO (1972)to define anemia. From Cook et al.,
