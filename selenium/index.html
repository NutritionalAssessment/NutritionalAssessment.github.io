<p style="font-size:26px; text-align:center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
In only a&nbsp;few decades, the trace element selenium (Se) was added to the Nutrition agenda as an essential nutrient with potential to reduce cancer risk. Found in the 1950's to prevent vitamin&nbsp;E deficiency disorders in animals, initial
investigations in animal nutrition spawned studies of metabolic mechanisms starting in the 1960's.  It is now known that Se functions as an essential constituent of some 25 proteins that contain a&nbsp;previously unrecognized Se-containing amino acid, selenocysteine.
These selenoproteins are thought to discharge the nutritional functions of Se.  The relationship of one, glutathione peroxidase, to the level of Se intake was used in 2000 to establish an RDA for Se.  Se is typically obtained from
protein-rich foods, particularly those produced on Se-rich soils.  Low Se status occurs in areas of low soil Se, and among individuals consuming low-protein diets.
Many consequences of Se deprivation are sub-clinical in nature, requiring other precipitating factors (vitamin&nbsp;E deficiency, low iodine intake, viruses, carcinogens) to reveal the effects of sub-optimal expression of selenoenzymes and/or insufficient amounts of active Se-metabolites.
Studies that started in the 1960's showed that Se can prevent carcinogenesis in animal and cell models, and that anti-tumorigenic activities required Se doses greater than those required to support selenoenzyme expression.  Only a&nbsp;few
clinical intervention trials have been conducted to test the hypothesis that Se supplementation can reduce cancer risk in humans; most, but not all have shown positive results.  Hence, whether Se may be a&nbsp;risk modifier for cancer remains unclear.

Selenium (Se) is an essential nutrient with
several multiple biological activities.  It was
first recognized for its toxic potential in the
1930's when it Se was identified as an active
principal in a&nbsp;plant-induced neuropathy of grazing
horses and cattle in the northern Great Plains of
the United States

 In the 1950s
its nutritional role was discovered with
experiments with laboratory and livestock species
that found the element to prevent pathologies in
vitamin&nbsp;E-deficient animals

Then, in the 1980s its role in human health was
indicated with the finding that very low blood Se
levels were associated with an endemic heart
disease in women and children in parts of China

<p>
That the various roles of Se have different
dose-response relationships has been demonstrated
in experimental animals.  Biochemical and
physiological lesions of Se deficiency are
prevented by relatively low dietary levels, e.g.,
0.1mg/kg

 <span data-tippy-content=" Combs GF Jr, Combs S. (1986) The Role of Selenium in Nutrition.  Academic Press, NY, pp. 266-326. &bull;&bull;&bull;NO PUBMED ENTRY&bull;&bull;&bull; "  >

 >Combs and Combs, 1986</a>).</span>

Reductions in
experimental tumorigenesis occur when Se is fed at
<span class="n">10&ndash;20</span> times the
nutritional level, i.e., &ge;&nbsp;1.5mg/kg

 <span data-tippy-content=" Ip, C., & Ganther, H. E. (1990). Activity of methylated forms of selenium in cancer prevention. Cancer research, 50(4), 1206–1211. ">

 target="right" >Ip, 1998</a>).</span>

Adverse effects are not seen unless still greater dietary
levels are used, i.e., &gt;&nbsp;5mg/kg

 <span data-tippy-content=" Combs GF Jr, Combs S. (1986) The Role of Selenium in Nutrition.  Academic Press, NY, pp. 1-14. &bull;&bull;&bull;NO PUBMED ENTRY&bull;&bull;&bull; "  >

Because Se intakes of free-living people
can seldom be ascertained accurately, Se status in
humans must be inferred from measures related to
the intake and disposition of Se.

	<h2 id="25b.2">25b.2  Selenium Chemistry</h2>

The chemistry of Se has similarities to that of
sulfur

 <span data-tippy-content="Combs GF Jr, Combs S. (1986) The Role of Selenium in Nutrition.  Academic Press, NY, pp 1-14. &bull;&bull;&bull;NO PUBMED ENTRY&bull;&bull;&bull; "  >

Hence, Se can be incorporated in plants and animal
tissues in lieu of sulfur.  However, Se-compounds
have higher redox potentials.  Thus, while
sulfides are metabolized to sulfates, selenate is
metabolized to selenide.  The biochemistry of Se
involves mainly its three anionic forms:  Se<sup>2-</sup>
(selenide and hydrogen selenide [H<sub>2</sub>Se]),
SeO<span class="supsub">2+<br>3</span>
(selenite and selenous acid (H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>), and
SeO<span class="supsub">2+<br>4</span>
(selenite and selenic acid [H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub>]).  Selenide is
pivotal in Se metabolism, as HSe<sup>&ndash;</sup> is the obligate
precursor for the biosynthesis of selenocysteine
(SeCys) , the functional form of the element.
Selenite is easily reduced.  At low pH it is
readily reduced by such agents such as ascorbic
acid and SO<sub>2</sub>.  It can also readily react with
nonprotein thiols (e.g., reduced glutathione
[GSH]) or with protein-sulfhydryl groups
subsequently to be reduced to selenide via
sequential formation of seleno&shy;trisulfides (e.g.,
oxidized glutathione [GSSeSG]) and
seleno&shy;disulfides (e.g., glutathione selenol
[GSSeH]).  Selenate is much more resistant to
reduction; it is activated to
adenosine-5-phosphoselenate as a&nbsp;first step in its
physiological reduction.
<p>
The major forms of Se in cells are the seleno&shy;amino
acids seleno&shy;cysteine and seleno&shy;methionine (SeMet).  In
each, Se is covalently bound to carbon.  seleno&shy;cysteine is
co-translationally synthesized in animal tissues;
whereas, seleno&shy;methionine is produced in plants and
microorganisms using elemental Se in lieu sulfur.
Animal tissues can incorporate seleno&shy;methionine into proteins
nonspecifically in place of methionine (Met).

Severe endemic Se deficiency has been
linked with two diseases of humans:  a&nbsp;juvenile
cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease) and an
osteoarthropathy (Kashin-Beck disease)

 <span data-tippy-content=" Combs GF Jr, Combs S. (1986) The Role of Selenium in Nutrition.  Academic Press, NY, pp. 327-400. &bull;&bull;&bull;NO PUBMED ENTRY&bull;&bull;&bull; "  >

These disorders were described in
rural, mountainous areas of central and
northeastern China and Russia (eastern Siberia)
where food systems were exceedingly low in Se
(soils &lt;&nbsp;125&micro;gSe/kg;
grains &lt;&nbsp;40&micro;gSe/kg) and
humans had blood Se levels &lt;&nbsp;25ng/mL (compared to
<span class="n">85&ndash;200ng/mL</span> in the United States).
<p>
<span class="topic">Keshan disease</span>
is a&nbsp;multifocal myocarditis primarily affecting children
<span class="n">2&ndash;10y</span>
and, to a&nbsp;lesser extent, women of
child-bearing age.  Diagnosis is based on signs of
acute or chronic cardiac insufficiency, cardiac
enlargement, arrhythmia, and electrocardiographic
abnormalities

 target="right" >Ge et&nbsp;al., 1983</a>).</span>

Affected individuals may show cardiogenic shock or
congestive heart failure.  In the 1970s, Chinese
scientists found Se effective in preventing the
disease

 (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/114371/"
 target="right" >Keshan Disease Research Group, 1979</a>).</span>

This led to the widespread use of Se supplements
(oral doses of sodium selenite at
<span class="n">0.5&ndash;1mg Se/wk,</span>
or table salt fortified with selenite at
<span class="n">10&ndash;15mg</span> Se per kilogram body weight)

Such interventions have
virtually eliminated Keshan disease from
previously affected areas.  It appears likely that
Keshan disease may be caused by cardiophilic RNA
viruses the virulence of which can be potentiated
by severe Se deficiency through increased viral
mutation

This suggests that Se deficiency may also increase
risks for other diseases caused by RNA viruses
(e.g., measles, influenza, hepatitis, and
HIV/AIDS).

<span class="topic">Kashin-Beck Disease</span>
 is an osteoarthropathy
affecting the epiphyseal and articular cartilage,
and epiphyseal growth plates of growing bones.

suggested that Se supplementation had some
value in preventing the disease.  However,
additional factors, including iodine deficiency
and exposure to fungal toxins, have been suggested
as etiological factors.
<p>
<span class="topic">Microbiome.  </span>
Dietary Se may also affect the
hindgut microbiome, which is involved in
immunologic signaling, energy abstraction from
non-digested carbohydrates, and carcinogenic risk.
Se reaches the hindgut in the form of non-digested
Se from the diet and endogenous Se from
enterohepatic circulation and sloughed mucosal

	<h2 id="25b.5">25b.5  Food Sources</h2>

<span class="topic">Plant Foods.  </span>
The Se contents of foods vary widely
due to the differences in the soluble Se contents
of soils, in the capacities for various plant
species to access soil Se, and, for livestock
products, in the amounts of biologically available
Se in feeds.  The Se contents of plant foods tend
to be influenced by the local soil Se environment.
For example, cruciferous vegetables, which are
naturally rich in sulfur, can accumulate
nutritionally significant amounts of
Se
<span class="n">(1&ndash;10mg/kg)</span> if grown
on high-Se soils or if fertilized
with selenite or selenate salts.  Studies in many
countries have shown the effects of geographic
variation in the Se contents of foods

<span data-tippy-content=" Combs G. F., Jr (2001). Selenium in global food systems. The British journal of nutrition, 85(5), 517–547.">

Wheat grain may contain
<span class="n">&gt;&nbsp;2&ndash;5mg Se/kg</span> if
produced in parts of the northern plains of North
America; but as little as 0.1mg Se/kg if produced
in Kansas or New Zealand; and only 0.005mg Se/kg
if produced in Shaanxi Province, China.  On a
global basis, foods with the lowest Se contents
are found in the provinces of Heilongjiang,
northern Shaanxi, and Sichuan in China.
<p>
<span class="topic">Animal Foods.  </span>
Because of the intimate
relationship between plants and animals in the
food chain, the Se contents of foods of animal
origins tend to be influenced by the local soil Se
environment.  Se is widely used as a&nbsp;supplement to
livestock feeds, usually as sodium
selenite/selenate.  This practice has reduced
geographic variation in the Se contents of animal
food products.  It does not, however, markedly
increase tissue Se contents, as the incorporation
of inorganic Se is limited to the synthesis of
seleno&shy;cysteine in the seleno&shy;proteins.  Because both seleno&shy;cysteine
and seleno&shy;methionine are found mainly as constituents of
proteins, the Se contents of foods of animal
origin tend to be correlated with their protein
content.  Therefore, muscle meats from most
species tend to contain
<span class="n">0.3&ndash;0.5mg Se/kg </span> higher
<span class="n">(4&ndash;15 times)</span> amounts.
<p>
<span class="topic">Human Diets.   </span>
In most human diets, the dominant
food sources of Se are cereals, meats and fish.
In American diets fewer than two dozen foods
provide most of the total dietary Se, with five
foods contributing half:  beef, bread, pork,
chicken and eggs

<span data-tippy-content=" Schubert, A., Holden, J. M., & Wolf, W. R. (1987). Selenium content of a&nbsp;core group of foods based on a&nbsp;critical evaluation of published analytical data. Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 87(3), 285–299. ">

Dairy products contribute small amounts of Se to the
total intakes in most countries, except in cases
where their consumption is relatively high or
where the rest of the diet provides little Se, or
both (e.g., New Zealand).  Vegetables and fruits
are uniformly low in Se and provide only small
amounts in most diets.
<p>
Because Se in foods is almost exclusively
associated with protein, individuals with
chronically low protein intakes are at risk for Se
deficiency.  Accordingly, Se-responsive muscular
pain and weakness was been described in patients
receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition

conversion of tRNA-bound serine to seleno&shy;cysteine.  seleno&shy;methionine
is incorporated differently; because it can charge
the tRNAMet, seleno&shy;methionine can be incorporated directly
but nonspecifically into proteins in lieu of Met.
For this reason, albumin is a&nbsp;primary component of
plasma Se in Se-fed individuals.

Individuals with relatively high Se
intakes can also excrete trimethylselenonium or
other seleno&shy;sugars in the urine, as well as
methylselenol in the breath.  The latter is
responsible for the &ldquo;garlic breath&rdquo; associated
with selenosis in livestock.  Metabolic tracer
studies have shown that, over a&nbsp;12-day period,
Se-adequate adults excrete a&nbsp;total of 17% of Se
from an oral selenite dose, but only 11% of Se
from an oral seleno&shy;methionine dose, the longer turnover being
due to the nonspecific incorporation of seleno&shy;methionine into
body proteins

	<h2 id="25b.9">25b.9 Assessing Selenium Status</h2>

Se status refers to the amount of metabolically
active or potentially metabolically active Se in
the body.  It includes the Se pool that is
metabolically functional and, thus, the most
nutritionally relevant, as well as other Se pools
that can be mobilized to functional forms.  It is
a product of an individual's intake, retention and
metabolism of Se-containing compounds.
Accordingly, Se status has four components:  Se
intake, tissue Se, Se excretion and Se function

<h3 id="25b.9.1">25b.9.1  Biomarkers of Selenium Intake</h3>

Se intakes of
individuals or populations can be assessed as the
sum of the products of the Se contents of
particular foods and the amounts of those foods
consumed.  In practice, this is done using
standard food composition tables and food
frequency questionnaires, which may not yield
accurate estimates of actual Se intake because of
the geographic variation in food Se contents not
captured in those tables.  Therefore,
determination of food Se by actual analysis of
representative samples is necessary to produce valid Se
intake estimates.  Speciation of Se has been
accomplished only for a&nbsp;few foods, e.g., lentil

<span data-tippy-content="Thavarajah, D., Vandenberg, A., George, G. N., & Pickering, I. J. (2007). Chemical form of selenium in naturally selenium-rich lentils (Lens culinaris L.) from Saskatchewan. Journal of agricultural and food chemistry, 55(18), 7337–7341. ">
 (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17685630/"
 target="right" >Thavarajah et&nbsp;al., 2007</a>).</span>

However, such information would not add value in understanding
Se status; estimates of total Se intake are
sufficient to determine whether individuals and
populations meet the recommended Se intakes.
<p>
Imputing Se intake from measured Se biomarkers is
most straightforward in subjects of
deficient-to-low Se status whose plasma Se
concentrations respond to supplemental Se in
proportion to the magnitude of supplementation

 (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15817859/"
 target="right" >Xia et&nbsp;al., 2005</a>).</span>

For non-deficient subjects,
however, the relationship of Se intake and plasma
Se level depends on the form of Se consumed.
Inorganic Se typically produces only minimal
increases (&lt;&nbsp;20%) in subjects with plasma Se
concentrations greater than about 70ng/mL

For Se-nondeficient individuals
consuming Se mostly as seleno&shy;methionine, Se intake can be
predicted from the Se concentration of plasma.


<h3 id="25b.9.2">25b.9.2  Biomarkers of Selenium Retention</h3>

Most absorbed Se is
taken up by liver to re-enter the circulation as a
component of Selenoprotein P

A significant amount
<span class="n">(15&ndash;20%)</span> is released in the
urine over several days.  Under normal conditions,
there appears to be only a&nbsp;small enterohepatic
circulation of absorbed Se; therefore, fecal Se is
comprised mostly of the unabsorbed portion of
ingested Se.  In animals fed nutritionally
adequate levels of selenite, fecal Se comprises
about a&nbsp;fifth of Se excretion

fecal Se increases at higher Se intakes.
<p>
<span class="topic">Inferring Retention.  </span>
Retention of Se in the body can be determined by
the difference between the amount of Se ingested
and the sum of urinary and fecal Se losses.  For
humans, this requires total collections of urine
and stools, ideally over a&nbsp;few days.
Alternatively, convenient samples of urine can be
used if indexed to creatinine concentration to
reduce errors associated with variation in urine
output; a&nbsp;non-absorbable dietary marker that can
be measured in the stool samples, can be used to
calculate the amount of diet corresponding to the
fecal sample analyzed for Se.
<p>
Assessment of Se retention is useful in livestock
nutrition where it can be used as a&nbsp;measure of the
bioavailability of feed forms of Se, or as a&nbsp;proxy
for the amount of Se in edible tissues

Tissues retain Se largely in
protein-bound forms, seleno&shy;cysteine being specifically
incorporated into seleno&shy;proteins and seleno&shy;methionine being
nonspecifically incorporated into all proteins
(Fig 1).  Accordingly, animals fed dietary sources
of seleno&shy;methionine will accumulate relatively large amounts
of Se in both the specific and non-specific pools;
whereas, those fed inorganic Se-compounds, e.g.,
selenite, will accumulate lesser amounts due to
that form only entering the specific (seleno&shy;cysteine) pool.
<p>
Estimating retained Se is useful in human studies
as indicators of the degree to which an individual
has met his/her Se requirement and may have Se
reserves.  This can be inferred from analyses of
the two specific seleno&shy;proteins (Selenoprotein&nbsp;P, Glutathione Peroxidase&nbsp;3) as
well as the non-specific component of plasma Se.
Those seleno&shy;proteins show maximal expression at

<h3 id="25b.9.3">25b.9.3  Biomarkers of Tissue Selenium </h3>

Selenium can be retained in
many organs.  Greatest concentrations are found in
the kidney, liver and pancreas, followed by cardiac
and skeletal muscle; this pattern is remarkably
similar across species, particularly under
non-deficient conditions

Because of its non-specific incorporations into
proteins, food sources of seleno&shy;methionine support greater
tissue Se accumulation than comparable intakes of
Se in inorganic forms.  For this reason, animal
studies using tissue Se accumulation as the
measure of bioavailability typically show Se in
foods/feedstuffs to be more highly available than
selenite or selenate

<span class="topic">Whole Blood.  </span>
Earlier studies employed whole blood
for the assessment of Se status.  Those showed
good correlations with functional biomarkers in
cohorts of relatively low Se status, as well as
responsiveness to supplementation with food
sources of Se (largely seleno&shy;methionine).  Blood samples can
be dried and later analyzed by X-ray fluorescence
analysis

Nevertheless,
whole blood Se measures can be difficult to
interpret in as much as they comprise both
cellular and non-cellular constituents both of
which have specific and non-specific components.
<p>
<span class="topic">Plasma/Serum.  </span>

The most useful tissue for
assessing Se status, particularly in humans, is
plasma (or serum, which is virtually equivalent
with respect to Se-containing components and,
therefore, total Se contents).  Se is stable in
plasma as long as microbial growth is prevented;
it can be determined with good sensitivity and
precision by automated atomic absorption
spectrophotometry reducing interferences by using
either graphite-furnace-AAS, or tandem inductively coupled
plasma/mass spectrometry (ICP/MS).  Plasma Se
consists mostly of Se that has been incorporated
both specifically as seleno&shy;cysteine and non-specifically as
seleno&shy;methionine into various proteins.  Seleno&shy;cysteine occurs in only
two plasma seleno&shy;proteins, Seleno&shy;protein&nbsp;P and Glutathione Peroxidase&nbsp;3, which
contain 10 and 4 seleno&shy;cysteine residues, respectively.
The synthesis of each, occurring in the liver and
kidney, respectively, depends on an ample
metabolic supply of selenide for the
co-translational biosynthesis of seleno&shy;cysteine

<p>
Plasma also contains a&nbsp;non-specific Se pool
comprised of seleno&shy;methionine incorporated into proteins <i>in
lieu</i> of Met with which it competes for tRNA<sup>Met</sup>
binding.  The potential for the unregulated,
non-specific incorporation into proteins is a
function of their various Met contents.  In
plasma, the most quantitatively important of these
is albumin, which contains 6 Met residues per
mole.  Assuming that seleno&shy;methionine can compete for
incorporation at each of those positions, seleno&shy;methionine
protein would provide a&nbsp;plasma Met space
equivalent to nearly 4mM.  The non-specific pool
can be estimated from the difference between the
specific and total Se pools.  By this approach,
more than half of plasma Se of a&nbsp;non-deficient
cohort was present in specific components (Glutathione Peroxidase&nbsp;3
and Seleno&shy;protein&nbsp;P comprising roughly equal amounts), with
almost as much Se present in non-specific
components

<span data-tippy-content=" Combs, G. F., Jr, Jackson, M. I., Watts, J. C., Johnson, L. K., Zeng, H., Idso, J., Schomburg, L., Hoeg, A., Hoefig, C. S., Chiang, E. C., Waters, D. J., Davis, C.

 target="right" >Combs et&nbsp;al., 2012</a>).</span>


Further, the
increase in plasma Se produced by
seleno&shy;methionine-supplementation consisted entirely of
expansion of the non-specific component, which
reached 73% of plasma Se in subjects consuming
some 300&micro;g Se/day.  Still, that amount comprised
less than 0.05% of the potential seleno&shy;methionine space,
indicating that the latter is unsaturable under
practical conditions.
<p>
In contrast to seleno&shy;cysteine and selenite, which enter the
specific seleno&shy;protein pool by a&nbsp;highly regulated
process, the incorporation of seleno&shy;methionine into the
nonspecific Se pool is unregulated, its size
reflecting the intake of seleno&shy;methionine over a&nbsp;wide range.
Accordingly, sources of seleno&shy;methionine are also more
effective than inorganic Se in increasing tissue
Se levels

Measurements of Glutathione Peroxidase&nbsp;3
activity and Seleno&shy;protein&nbsp;P can
identify the risk of nutritional deficiency.
Measurements of total Se and, perhaps, the
non-specific pool can identify luxus Se status.
Thus, it is apparent that the largest contributor
to the global variation in plasma Se, particularly
among subjects with plasma Se concentrations
greater than about 70ng/mL, is the non-specific
pool.

Because hair and nails contain
sulfur-rich proteins, each can accumulate Se.
In addition, hair and nail specimens are stable
and can be collected non-invasively, and can be
stored at very low cost.  For these reasons, these
specimens have been used to assess Se status in
epidemiological studies.  Such studies have shown
the amounts of Se in hair to be greater in
individuals with high Se intakes

<p>
It bears pointing out that the use of these
specimens to assess Se status relies on the
implicit but never validated assumption that their
Se contents reflect some metabolically relevant
component of body Se.  In fact, hair/nail Se is
not in dynamic equilibrium with any component of
circulating Se; it is actually an excretory form
of the element.  As such, samples of each contain
Se secreted at some time past, presumably
reflecting Se status at that time and making them
most useful in studies of populations with stable
dietary practices.  These contributions are very
small in comparison to urinary Se output and can
be ignored in estimating Se retention.

<h3 id="25b.9.4">25b.9.4  Biomarkers of Selenium Function </h3>

In principle, measurement of any of the seleno&shy;proteins would
yield information immediately relevant to the
physiological function of Se as an essential
nutrient.  The most widely used as biomarkers in
animal studies are the GPXs.  These, the thioredoxin reductasess, and
the iodothyronine deiodinasess show maximal expression in most species
with dietary Se concentrations of
<span class="n">0.1&ndash;0.2mg/kg</span>

<span class="topic">Selenoenzymes.  </span>

The list of practical biomarkers
of Se function is much shorter, being limited to
those occuring in accessible tissues:  The
extracellular isoform of GPX (Glutathione Peroxidase&nbsp;3), which
comprises
<span class="n">10&ndash;25%</span> of plasma&nbsp;Se (lower levels being
associated with greater plasma Se concentrations);
Seleno&shy;protein&nbsp;P, which comprises
<span class="n">20&ndash;70%</span> of plasma&nbsp;Se (lower
percentages being associated with greater plasma
Se concentrations); and the intracellular isoform
(GPX1), which can be assayed in erythrocytes,
lymphocytes, buccal cells and tissue biopsy
specimens.
<p>
Activities of the GPXs can be measured
spectrophotometrically using a&nbsp;glutathione
reductase-coupled assay

Because heme iron can cause interfering
glutathione oxidation in that assay, it is
necessary to treat erythrocyte samples with
Drabkin's reagent when assessing GPX1.  The GPXs
are homotetramers; each 23kD subunit contains a
seleno&shy;cysteine residue at its active center.  Unlike GPX1,
Glutathione Peroxidase&nbsp;3 is a&nbsp;glycoprotein produced mostly by the
kidney.  Seleno&shy;protein&nbsp;P is present in plasma as multiple
variants with an average molecular weight of 60kD

 reflecting limited expression of the iodothyronine deiodinasess.  While useful as
an indicator of thyroid hormone status, the T3:T4
ratio lacks specificity for Se status, as not only
can the conversion of thyroxine  to triiodo&shy;thyronine be impaired by Se
deprivation, but also the synthesis of thyroxine can be
impaired by deprivation of Se and/or iodine.  That
the pattern of low molecular weight Se-metabolites
in the hindgut lumen corresponds with that
of feces, would appear to suggest that a&nbsp;fecal sample
may ve useful as an indicator of the Se in the colon.

CH3SeH and, perhaps, other methylated
Se-metabolites would be candidate biomarkers

therefore, the most useful biomarker relevant to
Se-antitumorigenesis is plasma Se, the target
level being about 120ng/mL above which current
evidence indicates no further risk reduction.

	<h3 id="25b.9.6">25b.9.6  Biomarkers Relevant to Adverse Effects. </h3>

Biomarkers Relevant to Adverse Effects.  The
potential for very high Se status to produce
adverse physiological effects has been established
from animal studies and accidental exposures of
humans.  These reports have produced an array of
clinical indicators but few biomarkers with
predictive value.  For this reason, the default
choice has been to use as risk indicators the
highest Se tissue levels observed with no adverse
effects.  Most studies show no adverse effects in
human subjects with plasma Se levels &lt;&nbsp;1000ng/mL.
	
	<h2 id="25b.10">25b.10  Questions Remain  </h2>

Understanding of Se, the most recently recognized
essential nutrient, continues to grow.  It has
become clear that consequences of Se deprivation
are typically sub-clinical in nature, requiring
other precipitating factors (deficiencies of
vitamin&nbsp;E, iodine and/or protein; exposure to
viruses, or carcinogens) to reveal physiological
effects of sub-optimal expression of
seleno&shy;enzymes.  It is also apparent that
supranutritional intakes of Se, at which
seleno&shy;enzymes are fully expressed, can be
beneficial.  These facts raise three pressing
questions:
<ol>
<li>Can Se prevent cancer in humans?
The clinical significance of Se in cancer
prevention remains a&nbsp;subject of debate.  The nine
randomized clinical trials conducted to date have
yielded inconsistent results.  Systematic reviews
have found that Se may be effective in preventing
cancer in individuals of low to adequate, but not
high, Se status; and a&nbsp;U-shaped dose-response
relationship has been proposed

<span data-tippy-content="Chiang, E. C., Shen, S., Kengeri, S. S., Xu, H., Combs, G. F., Morris, J. S., Bostwick, D. G., & Waters, D. J. (2009).

 (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20877485/"
 target="right" >Chiang et&nbsp;al., 2009</a>).</span>

These conclusions are weakened by the fact
that several trials have not followed robust
protocols, and none has been conducted in recent
years or in cohorts with individuals of both
marginal and adequate Se status.
</li>
<li>What is the
window of safety for Se?  While it is clear that
very high levels of exposure are required to
produce selenosis, resolving the question of
whether supranutritional intakes of Se can
increase T2D risk remains unclear.  Clarifying
that will call for well controlled trials with
subjects randomized by T2D risk factors (high BMI,
elevated fasting glucose) and followed with
unequivocal diagnostic indicators (fasting
glucose, HbA1c, oral glucose tolerance).  Until
then, there would appear to be no justification
for any healthy adult, regardless of his/her
baseline Se status, to consume more
than 100&micro;g&nbsp;Se/day. </li>
<li>Who Can Benefit from Se?  This is the
ultimate question.
It is clear that
supplementation of adults with basal Se intakes
&lt;&nbsp;50&micro;g/d will increase seleno&shy;enzyme expression,
and that the magnitude of those increases will
depend on the extent to which baseline plasma Se
levels were below about 90ng/mL.  That individuals
with plasma Se levels less than about 120ng/mL may also benefit
from increased Se intakes is suggested from
results of the NPC Trial in which supplemental Se
reduced cancer risk among adults with plasma Se
levels in the range of
<span class="n">80&ndash;120ng/mL.</span>  This
suggests that individuals with plasma Se levels in
that range may benefit from cancer protection
unrelated to seleno&shy;enzyme expression.  If so, many
adults may benefit from increased Se intakes:
some to maximize seleno&shy;protein expression, others
to reduce cancer risks.</li>
