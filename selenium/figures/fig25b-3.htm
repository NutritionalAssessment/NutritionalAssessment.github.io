Figure 25b3. Stylized patterns of specific (solid areas, SeCys) and non-specific 
(hashed areas, presumed to be mostly SeMet in albumin) major components of 
plasma Se in subjects varying in Se status by consuming SeMet-containing foods.  
Not shown:  Se occurring as SeMet in GPX3 and SEPP1, as their potential 
contributions to non-specific plasma Se are very small (&lt; 0.1%).  Group 
labels: deficient = less than maximal seleno&shy;protein expression; adequate = 
maximal selenoprotein expression, i.e., meets nutritional requirement; “healthful” 
= supranutritional, including anti-tumorigenic doses; high = greater than needed for 
anti-tumorigenesis, but without adverse effects.
